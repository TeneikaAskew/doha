Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel    \nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nAugust 25, 2009\nDecision On Remand \nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 28, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge (AJ). The case was assigned to AJ\nDarlene D. Lokey Anderson on September 12, 2008, and a hearing was held on\nNovember 6, 2008. The AJ issued a Decision on November 25, 2008, which found that\n\u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.\u201d Applicant filed a timely appeal and the Appeal Board (AB)\nissued its decision on February 18, 2009, which concluded that the case be Remanded\nand assigned to a new AJ. The AB held that based on the \u201cvigor and length with which\n\n2\nthe Administrative Judge questioned [Applicant] as well as her citation in the course of\nthat questioning to matters outside the record . . . A careful review of the transcript has\nled the Board to conclude that it could cause a reasonable person to question the\nJudge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d Finally there was an instruction from the AB to \u201ctreat all SOR\nallegations as controverted.\u201d \nThe Remand was assigned to this AJ on March 9, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice\nof the Remand Hearing on March 25, 2009, and I convened the hearing on April 6,\n2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and two other witnesses testified on\nbehalf of Applicant. He submitted Exhibits A through F, which were entered into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on April 21,\n2009. \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant\nand his witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He received\na Bachelor of Science degree in 2000. Applicant works for a defense contractor, and he\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense\nsector.\n (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n1.a. It is alleged that on or about February 16, 2006, Applicant received a written\nwarning from his employer for attempting to sponsor unauthorized persons in GTMO\n(Guantanamo).\nDuring his testimony, Applicant denied that he had attempted to sponsor an\nunauthorized person in GTMO. He averred that he did make an oral inquiry on one\noccasion of the potential of sponsoring the brother of a linguist acquaintance of\nApplicant for a visit to the housing area of Applicant\u2019s employer. Applicant was informed\nthat it would not be possible to authorize  this individual, whose brother worked for\nanother company, to enter their housing site. Applicant seemed to believe that this\nindividual should have been authorized, since he was a United States citizen, but it was\nonly because he was the brother of an employee of a rival company. However, in any\nevent,  according to Applicant\u2019s quite credible testimony, once he was so informed, he\nnever made any other inquiry or attempt to have this individual gain access to this site\n(Tr at 93-98).\nDespite the fact that Applicant did receive a written warning from his supervisor\nregarding this conduct (Exhibit 5), I do not find any other evidence to establish that\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s oral inquiry actually violated any company rules or regulations, or in any way\ncould be considered a security violation. \n  \n1.b.  It is alleged that in May 2004, Applicant received a verbal warning and\ncounseling form his employer for accessing inappropriate pornographic web sites on his\nGovernment computer and for over reporting the hours that he purportedly worked. \nThere are two concerns raised in this allegation, and they will be addressed\nseparately: \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied, as he has continuously done, that he ever\naccessed any pornographic web sites on any Government computers. Witnesses A,\nwho appeared on behalf of Applicant, testified that at the time in question, it was not\npermissible to access pornographic sites. This witness, who is soon to be a First\nLieutenant in the United States Army reserve, worked as a military liaison with Applicant\nin Guantanamo, on an almost daily basis in the same room. He reiterated that at the\ntime period in question, the Government had on its computers, a kind of fire wall, that\nwould block any pornographic web sites or any sites that if found objectionable, and it\nwould make a note of the account of the individual attempting to gain access to that site.\nHe also stated that, to his knowledge, he was not aware of Applicant ever attempting to\ngain access to a pornographic site, nor had he ever heard from anyone else that\nApplicant had tried to visit objectionable sites (Tr at 42-45).  \nThe only site that appears to have been of concern, and which Applicant\nconcedes that he used, was \u201cMyspace.\u201d However, Witness A also testified that at the\ntime they were at Guantanamo, social networking websites such as Myspace were\npermitted by the Government (Tr at 43-44.)  While Exhibit 5 does show that Applicant\ndid receive a written warning from his supervisor regarding improper ADP usage, based\non the very credible and objective testimony of Witness A that pornographic websites\ncould not be accessed on Government computers, plus the consistent denial by\nApplicant that he ever accessed pornographic sites, I do not see that any evidence has\nbeen submitted to prove that Applicant ever accessed any pornographic sites on a\nGovernment computer. \nThe second concern addressed in this allegation concerns Applicant giving\nincorrect information about the hours that he worked. Applicant testified that this\nallegation only concerns one event occurring on April 12, 2004, when, at the time he\nwas allowed one hour for lunch, he allegedly took an extra half hour, which he did not\nproperly report on his timecard. \nIt is Applicant\u2019s contention that there was scheduled on April 12, 2004, a sale of\nsurplus furniture on the base. He stated that he received authorization from the Navy\nnon-commissioned officer to attend the sale, and since he was going to be back one\nhalf hour later than planned because of the crowd attending the sale, he also called to\nreport his delay to the Navy non-commissioned officer before his return. He also stated\nthat he followed the proper procedure, and there was no one from his company to\nwhom he was authorized to report (Tr at 113-117).\n\n4\nDuring Witness A\u2019s testimony, he also averred that for the approximately six\nmonths that he worked with Applicant, he never was aware of Applicant failing to report\nto duty on time or failing to complete his shift in a proper manner (Tr at 50-52).\nApplicant\u2019s reporting back to work one half hour late, on one occasion, certainly\ndoes not show a failure to follow rules and regulations.\n1.c. It is alleged that on or about January 5, 2005, Applicant received a written\nwarning from his employer for losing two security badges (The date listed on the SOR\nwas December 2004, but upon a motion by Department Counsel, based upon evidence\nintroduced at the hearing (Exhibit 3), and with no objection from Applicant\u2019s counsel, the\ndate was amended to January 5, 2005.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant conceded that he lost two identification badges on one\noccasion, on or about December 12, 2004. Exhibit E includes the January 5, 2005\nwritten warning, which states that Applicant was formally counseled for the loss of his\nidentification badges. There is also included an email that shows the badges were\nultimately found and recovered without ever being misused. \nMitigation\nApplicant offered into evidence seven new character letters from individuals who\nknow or have known him in his professional or private life (Exhibit A), as well as five\ncharacter letters that had previously been offered into evidence for the first hearing\n(Exhibit B). They were all remarkably laudatory in describing  Applicant\u2019s high integrity,\nreliability, and good judgement. A Lieutenant Commander from the U.S. Navy, who was\nApplicant\u2019s Officer-in-Charge, described Applicant in Exhibit B as \u201cDependable and\ncommitted, he could be counted on to work beyond his scheduled hours or on\ndesignated days off without complaint or questions . . . a man of the highest caliber and\nintegrity.\u201d\nHe submitted three Certificates of Appreciation that he received for his\nmeritorious service (Exhibit C). His performance evaluations for September 2004 and\nApril 2005 were also offered (Exhibit D). The 2005 review stated, \u201cLinguist\ndemonstrates high level of professionalism and self-motivation. Linguist is considered\nvery dependable and provides quality service. Supports Cell-Block as night shift\ndispatcher. Most reliable night shift linguist.\u201d \nFinally, Witness B, who is a personal friend of Applicant, even though there is a\n32 year difference in their ages, testified on his behalf. He has known Applicant for 10\nyears, and, he stated that Applicant \u201cis one of the finest young men I\u2019ve ever met . . . He\nis a person of character . . . I would trust him with my family and my life\u201d (Tr at 78-81).\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence has failed to establish that Applicant\ncommitted any conduct that could be considered to involve questionable judgement,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. W hile\nApplicant\u2019s loss of his security badges on one occasion in December 2004, had the\npotential to be an issue of concern, no evidence was introduced to show that this\nnegligent conduct occurred more than one time or more recently that December 2004.\nTherefore, I do not find that any of his conduct as alleged by the Government\nshould be considered a security concern under Guideline E. In reviewing the\nDisqualifying Conditions (DCs) under Guideline E, I conclude that no DCs apply.  I\nresolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s strong and credible testimony,\ntogether with his positive employment evaluations, and the many extremely laudatory\nletters of recommendation and the positive testimony from the two witnesses, I find that\nthe record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns in the SOR. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. -1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e, but denies the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Applicant is a 27-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with his company since September 2005. He served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 2001 to September 2005. He separated at the rank of E-5. He recently married in January 2008.

On March 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 16, 2008. \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 21, 2008. The case was \ntransferred to me on June 4, 2008. On June 6, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, \nscheduling the hearing for July 16, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The \nGovernment offered four exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \n\u2013 4. The Applicant offered one exhibit which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant also testified. The transcript was received on July 23, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.e, but denies the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.  \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with his company since \nSeptember 2005. He served on active duty in the United States Navy from September \n2001 to September 2005. He separated at the rank of E-5. He recently married in \nJanuary 2008. He and his current wife have an eight-month-old daughter. He has a two \nsons, ages six and three, from a prior marriage, and a six-year-old daughter from a prior \nrelationship. (Tr at 5, 24-25, 74; Gov 1.)  \n \nOn June 22, 2006, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security  \nPosition, (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. He answered \u201cNo\u201d in \nresponse to question 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent \non any debt(s)?\u201d He also answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(b) \u201cAre you \ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes\u201d in response to \nquestion 28(b) \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any \nproperty repossessed for any reason?\u201d He listed a $10,487 garnishment for past child \nsupport. (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:  a $17,071 judgment entered in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at \n1); a $12,742 balance on an automobile loan placed for collection in November 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 2); a $487 credit card account charged off as a bad debt in \nDecember 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 1); a $5,216 credit union loan charged \noff as a bad debt in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 2); and a delinquent \nchild support account with an approximate balance of $7,986 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 3 at 2; \nGov 4 at 1). \n \nIn an undated response to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that he could not \nafford to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d, and that he will seek financial \ncounseling. He provided a copy of the child support orders issued against him, and \ncopies of his paycheck statement for January 20, 2008 and February 8, 2008. His net \npay after deductions including child support is $344.41. He is paid bi-weekly. (Gov 2.) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that his financial finances became a problem after \nhis divorce. He and his first wife divorced in April 2007. His ex-wife ran up the credit \ncard balance. He does not want to pursue action against her because it would hurt his \ntwo sons financially. The amount of delinquent child support is high because he was not \n\n \n3 \n \n \naware of the existence of his oldest daughter until she was four-years-old. He is paying \nchild support for all of his children. (Tr at 17 -19.) \n \nApplicant states that he did not intentionally falsify his security clearance \nquestionnaire. He claims he left the questionnaire blank and was going to answer it \nlater. He alleges that a women who worked in the security office at the time, changed \nthe questionnaire to indicate that he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He had nothing to corroborate this \nassertion. The woman is no longer employed with the company. (Tr at 17, 29-33  ) \n \nApplicant pays $325 per month for his oldest daughter. He pays $802 per month \nfor his two sons. (Tr at 51.) He provided a copy of two recent pay statements dated July \n11, 2008, and June 28, 2008.  His net pay after his deductions including child support is \n$337.05 every two weeks which is approximately $674.10 per month. (Tr. at 41; AE A.) \nAside from paying for child support, Applicant has not attempted to resolve the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d. (Tr at 50.) He claims the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is the same debt that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr at 49.)   \n \nApplicant and his new wife intend to establish a budget and attend financial \ncounseling. He was waiting for the outcome of his security clearance investigation to \nattend financial counseling.  His new wife owns a home and is a GS-12 with the federal \ngovernment. He has two step-children, a girl, age 16, and a boy, age 14. (Tr at 42-45, \n52.)   \n  \nApplicant has been handling classified information since he was on active duty in \nthe United States Navy. He would never accept money in return for taking negative \naction against the government. (Tr at 21.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has five delinquent accounts \nwith the total approximate balance of $43,393. Of that amount, $7,986 relates to past \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndue child support. There is a possibility that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are \nthe same account. However, the credit reports in the record do not provide enough \ninformation to confirm they are the same account. Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation that would verify that they are the same account. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility is too recent to apply this mitigating \ncondition. Although Applicant is paying child support for his children, he took no steps to \nresolve the delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d. It is unlikely he will be able \nto resolve these accounts based on the amount of take home pay he receives after his \nchild support is deducted.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Although Applicant\u2019s recent \ndivorce adversely affected his finances, I cannot conclude that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances because he took minimal action towards resolving his \ndelinquent accounts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. He intends to \ndo so in the future. His financial problems remain due to his inability to pay his \ndelinquent accounts.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s child support \nobligations (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He is making regular payments towards his child support \nobligations. However, he has not taken steps towards resolving the remaining \ndelinquent accounts.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d in response to questions 28(a) and \n28(b) on his security clearance questionnaire, dated June 22, 2006. There is \ncircumstantial evidence to support the premise that these two accounts were more than \n90 days delinquent at the time Applicant responded to question 28(b), and should have \nbeen entered in response to question 28(b). There is circumstantial evidence to support \nthe premise that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was more than 180 days delinquent, and \nshould have been entered in response to question 28(a.) The following Personal \nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities). Applicant claims that he left the answers to these questions blank and \nan employee in the security office changed his answers to \u201cNo.\u201d  I do not find this \nexplanation credible. At the end of the security clearance questionnaire, there is a \nsection titled, \u201cAdditional Comments.\u201d Applicant had the opportunity to indicate that he \nmight have delinquent debts in this section. While I would like to give Applicant the \nbenefit of the doubt, his explanation was too implausible absent some corroboration.  \n \n \nNone of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Concerns (PC MC) apply. I find against  \nApplicant under the Personal Conduct concern. \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active \n\n \n7 \n \n \nservice in the United States Navy. I considered that Applicant\u2019s divorce adversely \naffected his financial situation. I considered that Applicant is dutifully making his child \nsupport payments. However, questions remain under the financial considerations \nconcern due to Applicant\u2019s failure to take action towards resolving his remaining \ndelinquent accounts. Applicant did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations. Concerns are raised about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability \nunder personal conduct due to his omission of delinquent debts on his security \nclearance questionnaire, and his implausible explanation for the omission during the \nhearing.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Ronald C. Sykstus, Esq. \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on July 7, 2007.\nOn February 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug use (Guideline H).\nThe action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on March 7, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 18, 2008, and the hearing was held on August 7, 2008. At the\nhearing, three exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) were admitted in evidence without objection\nto support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified, and called four witnesses. Five\nexhibits (AE) were admitted to support Applicant\u2019s evidence. AE F contains Applicant\u2019s\nanswer to the SOR, a statement of intention not to use drugs in the future, and also a\ncharacter statement from his supervisor who also testified. DOHA obtained a copy of\nOctober 27, 2008\n\n2\nthe hearing transcript on August 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains three allegations under the drug involvement guideline.\nApplicant admitted all allegations, but provided some minor changes to two the\nallegations. Under SOR 1.a., he thought he stopped using marijuana in October 2004,\nand was certain he stopped by January 29, 2005. He admitted SOR 1.b. as alleged. He\nadmitted SOR 1.c., but opined he spent over $50.00 but less than $100.00 in marijuana\npurchases. See also, section 5 of GE 2. At the bottom of his answer (AE F) is an oath\nsigned and notarized by him. The oath addresses his past marijuana use an intentions\nin the future not to use the drug.\nApplicant is 23 years old, single, with no children. He graduated from high school\nin May 2003. He graduated from college in May 2007 with a Bachelor of Science degree\nin software engineering (AE B), with a very good scholastic average. (AE C) He has\nbeen working for his current employer since June 2007. He seeks a security clearance. \nDrug Involvement\nAccording to his security clearance questionnaire (SCA, GE 1), Applicant\nindicated he used marijuana from about September 2001 to approximately July 2005,\nestimating that he used the drug about 60 times during the period. In September 2001,\nhe was about 16 years old. (Tr. 25) He used the drug with one to four individuals at\ndifferent times. Three individuals either lived in the neighborhood and/or attended the\nsame high school. One individual attended the first year of college with Applicant. In\nhigh school, Applicant used marijuana about 40 to 50 times until his parents were told\nby one of his friends in April 2002 (Tr. 28) that he was using marijuana. They imposed\nsome type of discipline. (Tr. 29) Applicant indicated he did not use drugs from April\n2002 until October 2003. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant began college in August 2003, and resumed using marijuana in\nOctober 2003. He testified that he used marijuana about 10 to 20 times in college (Tr.\n28), and stopped using the drug when he started applying for a cooperative position in\nthe fall of 2004. (Tr. 23, 32) In response to section 8 of GE 2 (Interrogatory answers,\nnotarized on January 29, 2008), Applicant stated, \u201cI have not used marijuana since then\n(January 29, 2005, interview conducted by authorized investigator for the Department of\nDefense). See, GE 3. My dates might be inaccurate because I know I stopped during\nmy sophmore (sic) year (8/2004-5/2005). I know I stopped before this interview though,\nbecause I stopped so that it wouldn\u2019t interfere with my co-op position.\u201d In his response\nto section 9 of GE 2 requesting that he explain why discrepancies appear in his\nprevious statements about his purchase and use of marijuana, he indicated he knew he\nstopped in the fall of the 2004. He noted, however, that over time his estimates of use\nwould vary. \n\n The exhibit is a case summary prepared on February 23,, 2005 by an authorized investigator for the\n1\nDepartment of Defense. The exhibit contains Applicant\u2019s interview, verification of his education, and interviews\nwith other individuals. \n3\nGE 3  contains the interview of Applicant at his home on January 29, 2005.\n1\nDuring this interview, Applicant was asked about his drug use. He stated his marijuana\nuse was experimental, and he never bought or sold the drug. In addition, he stated he\nhad not used the drug since April 2002, and had no intention of using it in the future. At\nthe hearing, Applicant could not recall the January 29, 2005-interview, even after\nreviewing the exhibit. (Tr. 41, 42) Applicant was positive he was in school at the time\nand not at home on January 29, 2005 when the interview occurred. (Tr. 36, 48, 49) I do\nnot find his responses credible. \nThe investigation summary (GE 3) also includes interviews of Applicant and other\nindividuals. Two of those people interviewed were identified by Applicant at the hearing\nas having used marijuana with him in high school. Those same two individuals are\nreferenced several times in Applicant\u2019s security clearance questionnaire. (SCA, GE 1)\nUnlike the January 29, 2005-interview, Applicant recalled traveling in March 2005\nfor three interviews to an agency of the Department of Defense, at a location in the\nMiddle Atlantic region over a three-day period. He recalled fielding questions about his\ndrug use and information about possible employment. However, he recalled no details\nof the interviews at the hearing.\nAt the bottom of the page of Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (AE F) is a notarized\nstatement regarding his past drug use, and future intentions regarding drug use.\nApplicant stated:\nI used marijuana when I was young and in school, and I [no] longer use it.\nI stopped over three and a half years ago and have not used it since and\nhave had no desire to use it since. I am no longer associated with the\npeople that I used it with in the past, and none of the people I associate\nwith now use marijuana. I am willing to take any additional steps to prove\nthat I am capable fo the responsibilities of a security clearance. I agree to\nnot use marijuana in the future, and understand that doing so will be an\nautomatic revocation of my clearance. (AE F)\nAfter learning about Applicant\u2019s drug use in April 2002, his father had a\ndiscussion with Applicant about his drug use. His father got the impression that\nApplicant\u2019s use was a \u201cone type thing.\u201d (Tr. 78) The father also believed that Applicant\u2019s\ndrug use stopped after he was grounded in April 2002. (Tr. 79) The first time Applicant\u2019s\nfather found out about Applicant\u2019 drug use in college was after he had been denied a\nsecurity clearance a year or more before the hearing. (Tr. 80) After Applicant returned\nfrom the Middle Atlantic interviews in March 2005, his father thought Applicant would be\ngetting the job he had interviewed for. (Tr. 80-81) Regarding Applicant\u2019s friend who\nused marijuana with him in high school, his father has known this friend since Applicant\n\n4\nwas in the third grade, and is aware that Applicant and the friend go to movies together.\n(Tr. 85)\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s minister testified he knows Applicant\u2019s family, and met Applicant in\n1993. The minister worked with Applicant in religious education activities and a youth\nprogram. According to the minister, Applicant is a truthful person who made a mistake\nby yielding to peer group pressure. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a principal engineer, interviewed Applicant in May 2007,\nand became his supervisor after Applicant was hired in June 2007. Applicant has\nperformed exceptionally well in software development, testing and support. His\nsupervisor recalled that Applicant\u2019s drug test results were negative when he was initially\nhired. (Tr. 60)\nApplicant\u2019s father was surprised to learn Applicant used marijuana in college\nbecause Applicant never presented problems for his parents. Furthermore, Applicant\ntold them he does not lie because that makes him feel bad. (Tr. 75) Applicant\u2019s father\ntestified that his family has been living at the same address for 10 years. (Tr. 71) \nApplicant\u2019s former high school principal, who has known Applicant since 2000,\nrecalled Applicant was a fine student. The principal hired Applicant in 2007 to provide\ncomputer support at the school. The principal provided Applicant with a key to enter the\nschool after hours to handle the computer issues. (Tr. 90) The principal first learned of\nApplicant\u2019s drug use approximately two weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 96)\nAE A is Applicant\u2019s resume. Applicant received his college degree in May 2007.\n(AE B) AE C is Applicant\u2019s college transcript. Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation for the\nperiod June to August 2007 reflects an \u201cexceeds requirements\u201d rating. (AE D) AE E is a\ncharacter statement from a neighbor who has lived across the street from Applicant for\nthe past 10 years. This neighbor believes Applicant is a well-mannered person who\ndeserves a security clearance. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\n\n5\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. If doubt\nlingers regarding an applicant\u2019s security worthiness, that doubt must be resolved in\nfavor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\nthat are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or\nconjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement (DI) \n24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules or regulations.\u201d \u00b6 24\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement falls within the scope of DI disqualifying condition\n(DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC 24.c. (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia) based on Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and purchase of the drug.\nApplicant used the drug (with sporadic purchases) on 40 to 50 occasions from\nSeptember 2001 until he was reprimanded by his parents in April 2002, after they were\ninformed of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use by someone in the neighborhood. Significantly,\nduring the discussion with his father in April 2002, while admitting his drug use,\nApplicant was not candid about the full scope of his use. Even after his parents\n\n Although the exhibit is a report of investigation (ROI) and hearsay, it is a business record containing\n2\ninvestigative results prepared by an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense. The exhibit\ncontains information that is reliable based on its internal consistency and the fact that most of the information\nwithin the exhibit can be independently authenticated by other government exhibits and testimony. The exhibit\nwas admitted without objection. (Tr. 99)\n6\ndisciplined him in April 2002, he resumed marijuana use in October 2003, using the\ndrug 10 to 20 times until late 2004. His father did not find out about Applicant\u2019s\nsubsequent marijuana use in college until 2006 or 2007. \nGE 3 includes Applicant\u2019s interview on January 29, 2005, in which he stated he\nnever purchased marijuana, and he quit using the drug in April 2002.  Applicant\u2019s\n2\nsupposed inability to recall the interview, and belief he was at school at the time are not\npersuasive because the explanations are not credible. The record provides substantial\nevidence that Applicant was not candid with his father about his marijuana use. He\ndisplayed this same lack of candor with the government on January 29, 2005 by not\nproviding a complete account of his drug use which did not end until at least the fall of\n2004. \nApplicant\u2019s misrepresentation to his father in April 2002 and during most of his\ncollege days, and his misrepresentations to the government on January 29, 2005, also\nundercut the credibility of his sworn statement made on March 7, 2008. The record\ncontains several references indicating that Applicant still associates with a few of the\nsame individuals he used the marijuana with in high school. \nWhether any of the mitigating conditions under the DI guideline apply depend on\nthe facts and circumstances of a particular case. The first two DI mitigating conditions\nare potentially applicable to circumstances of this case. The passage of more than three\nyears (almost four years) would usually afford a sufficient basis to apply DI mitigating\ncondition (MC) 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. However, the passage of time does not apply as his marijuana use was much\nmore than experimental. The level of use and Applicant\u2019s misrepresentations about his\nuse still cast doubt on his honesty and trustworthiness. DI MC 26.a. is inapplicable. \nDI MC 26.b. ((1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period\nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance\nfor any violation) is inapplicable because of Applicant\u2019s lack of forthrightness during the\nsecurity investigation. Applicant\u2019s disassociation from drug users has not been\nsufficiently demonstrated. There is no evidence concerning a change in environments\nwhere drugs are not used. In light of Applicant\u2019s undermined credibility, the passage of\nmore than three years, along with Applicant\u2019s sworn statement regarding his past\nmarijuana use and intention not to use in the future, do not overcome the negative\nevidence under the DI guideline. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC.\nThey are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant began using marijuana when he was a 16-year-old teenager. He used\nthe drug more than experimentally from September 2001 to April 2002. He concealed\nthe full scope of his marijuana use from his father for a long time, even though his father\nbelieves Applicant gets mad when he commits an act of dishonesty. In January 2005,\nApplicant, age 19, provided material misinformation to the government, giving the\nimpression that he never purchased marijuana, and stopped using the drug in April\n2002, after his father disciplined him. \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence demonstrates he achieved good grades in\ncollege. His job evidence shows that he is performing well at work. His minister has\nenjoyed working on religious projects with Applicant. His neighbor has found him to be a\nwell-mannered person who deserves a security clearance. His former high school\nprincipal considers Applicant a reliable and trustworthy individual. However, the same\ntype of trustworthiness that Applicant demonstrated to the principal must also be\ndemonstrated to the government. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with the government still\nraises residual, trustworthiness concerns that have not been mitigated. Applicant has\nfailed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion under the DI guideline. Subparagraphs\n1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are found against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on December 29, 2005. On May 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).1  \n \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nSeptember 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on May 30, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 25, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 9, 2008. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on August 4, 2008. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted without objection.2 Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented \none witness and five exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection.3 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August \n12, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nThe Government elected not to pursue the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f (Tr. 87). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations, except for SOR \u00b6 \n1.f, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old research analyst working for a defense contractor. He \nhas never been married and has no children. He was born in Ghana to a Ghanaian \nfather and an American mother. His 70-year-old father is a resident and citizen of \nGhana. He was educated in England and the United States. While in the United States, \nhis father married his mother. Applicant\u2019s mother is a native U.S. citizen. After he \nfinished his education, Applicant\u2019s parents moved to Ghana. Applicant and his siblings \nwere born and raised in Ghana. As a child, he travelled with his mother to the United \nStates almost every year to visit his mother\u2019s family. He completed third grade, part of \nfourth grade, and eighth grade in U.S. schools (Tr. 74). In 1986, at age 14, Applicant\u2019s \nmother, and her three children moved to the United States. Applicant finished his last \nthree years of high school in the United States. \n \nFrom 1988 to 1993, he attended a U.S. university, and received a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in African Studies and French. He completed his Master\u2019s degree in Economics \nin 1996, and received his Ph.D. in International Economics in 2004 both at U.S. \nuniversities. In 2004, Applicant was hired by his current employer, a defense contractor, \nas a research analyst. During the last four years, he has impressed his supervisors and \ncolleagues with his candor, honesty, and integrity. Applicant is considered to be a \nvalued employee and an outstanding researcher. He displays high ethical and moral \nstandards. In his references\u2019 opinion, Applicant is a loyal American citizen who poses no \nrisk to the interests of the United States. They recommended Applicant for a security \n \n2  GE 4 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n3  AE 11 was timely submitted post-hearing. I kept the record open to allow Applicant time to \nsubmit additional documentation. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum, stating no objections to me \nconsidering Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission is included in AE 11. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \nclearance without reservations. There is no evidence he has ever compromised \nclassified information or that he has failed to follow the rules for handling classified \ninformation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a lawyer by profession who transitioned into Ghana\u2019s political \narena (Tr. 13, Answer to the SOR). For over 21 years, he has served in high and \nsensitive Government positions in the Ghanaian government.4 During the last 15 years, \nApplicant\u2019s father served in Ghana\u2019s National Democratic Congress. He recently \nresigned his position in the National Democratic Congress and formed a new political \nparty, in which he holds a preeminent position. Applicant\u2019s father is considered an \nupstanding politician and a well-respected individual. Applicant is very proud of his \nfather and recognizes he could not fill in his shoes (Tr. 39).  \n \nSince his arrival to the United States, Applicant has travelled to Ghana four \ntimes, two times in 2007, once in 2005, and once in 1997 (Tr. 26, 42, Answer). He \ntravelled to Ghana to visit with his father, family, and friends. Whenever he travelled to \nGhana, Applicant would visit with his family for 30 to 60 days. Applicant has telephonic \ncontact with his father at least once a month (Tr. 39). He has personal contact with him \napproximately once every two years when either Applicant travels to Ghana or his father \ntravels to the United States. His father travels to the United States to visit his wife and \nchildren, and to pick up medications. Applicant has minimal contact with his father \nbecause his father is not a communicative person and is always busy with politics (Tr. \n41). Applicant\u2019s father has six siblings living in Ghana, four brothers and two sisters. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his extended family is infrequent - limited to personal contact \nwhen he travels to Ghana, or the occasional holiday telephone calls. \n \nApplicant maintains contact with a Ghanaian cousin and a high school friend both \nof whom are residents and citizens of Ghana (Tr. 42). His cousin is an Information \nTechnology technician working for a private company. Applicant reestablished contact \nwith his cousin during his 2005 trip to Ghana. Upon his return to the United States, \nApplicant continued his contact with his cousin exchanging e-mails approximately once \na month. Lately, his contact has diminished to an exchange of e-mails once or twice a \nyear. Applicant\u2019s contact with his Ghanaian friend is limited to infrequent e-mails and \ntelephone call.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a native U.S. citizen, raised, and educated in the United \nStates. She met and married Applicant\u2019s father during college. After their marriage, they \nmoved to Ghana where he worked as a teacher. In 1986, his mother, Applicant, and two \nsiblings moved back to the United States. Applicant\u2019s father provided financial support \nfor his family in the United States including paying for housing and college expenses \n(Tr. 61).  \n \n \n4  The Government positions held by Applicant\u2019s father, as well as his tenure in those positions \nhave been withheld to protect Applicant\u2019s privacy. That information is available in GE 1, GE 2, and the \ntranscript.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant\u2019s siblings were also born in Ghana. They are dual Ghanaian and U.S. \ncitizens by birth. Both siblings are married to U.S. citizens and they consider themselves \nU.S. citizens (Tr. 75). His brother served honorably in the U.S. Army for three years. He \nwas stationed in Korea during his term of service. His permanent residence is in the \nUnited States. \n \nApplicant considers himself to be a U.S. citizen by birthright (Tr. 36). He has no \nproperty or any financial interests in Ghana. He never registered to vote in Ghana, and \nhas not participated in any elections in that country. There is no evidence to show that \nApplicant has ever exercised any of the rights and privileges reserved for Ghanaian \ncitizens since moving to the United States. He testified he never discusses his work or \nany matter related to his employment, terrorism, or U.S. national security with any \nmembers of his family.  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Ghana is a constitutional \ndemocracy with a developing economy. The present government was created in 1993, \nand since then, there have been several peaceful, democratic transfers of governmental \npowers. The government of Ghana generally respects human rights and continues to \nmake improvements in its human rights practices. The United States and Ghana \nenjoyed good relations maintained through educational and scientific institutions and \ncultural links. The U.S. and Ghanaian militaries have cooperated in numerous military \nexercises. The United States is among Ghana\u2019s principal trading partners. In 2007, the \nUnited States provided $55 million in developmental assistance to Ghana. There is no \nevidence to show Ghana conducts economic, financial, or intelligence espionage \nagainst the United States, that it supports terrorist organizations, or that it has inimical \ninterests to the United States. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n \n5  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d6 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \n \n6  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s history of working for the Ghanaian government in sensitive \npositions, and his contribution to the forming of a new political party, raise security \nconcerns. Applicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection and/or \nobligation with his father. The closeness of the relationship between him and his father \nis shown to some extent by his personal and telephone contacts with his father; his \npride and respect for his father\u2019s accomplishments; and the financial assistance \nprovided by his father to Applicant\u2019s mother, Applicant, and his siblings. These contacts \ncreate a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the \npossibility that Ghanaian agents or terrorists may exploit the opportunity to obtain \ninformation about the United States. His connection to his father\u2019s family members also \ncreates a potential conflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently close to \nraise a security concern about his desire to help his extended family by providing \nsensitive or classified information.  \n \n \n \n7  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nTwo Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s favorable information is sufficient to mitigate the Foreign \nInfluence security concerns.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his father and his extended family in Ghana \ncreates a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. However, in light of Ghana\u2019s \nhistory and current diplomatic and economic relationship with the United States, I do not \nbelieve Applicant\u2019s contact with his father, and his father\u2019s family members in Ghana, \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. Available information suggests Ghana\u2019s government does not have a history \nof targeting American citizens to obtain U.S. information. Ghana and the United States \nhave diplomatic and economic relations, and the United States is currently assisting \nGhana with millions of dollars in economic and technical aid. Also, there is no evidence \nGhana\u2019s government has ever collected or is collecting U.S. military, economic, or \ntechnical information. Under the circumstances of this case, it is unlikely that Applicant \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual or government and the U.S. interests. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United States for approximately \n22 years, during which he finished high school, attended college, and higher education. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two siblings live in the United States. All of his financial and \nbusiness interests are in the United States. Applicant has established himself as a \nproud American citizen and a successful professional. He has worked for a U.S. \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncontractor for four years and has established a track record as an outstanding \nresearcher. He displays high ethical and moral standards. Applicant is a loyal American \ncitizen who poses no risk to the interests of the United States. His references \nrecommended Applicant for a security clearance without reservations. There is no \nevidence he ever compromised classified information or that he has failed to follow the \nrules for handling classified information. \n \nApplicant has had infrequent contact or communication with most of his \nGhanaian relatives since he left Ghana in 1986. He has maintained some contact with a \ncousin and a childhood friend. Overall, I find Applicant\u2019s contact with his extended family \nmembers is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a \nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation. Considering the record evidence as a whole, AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 8a, (b) and (c) apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant credibly averred his loyalty to the United States, his desire to help the \nUnited States, and his desire to live only in the United States. Applicant has lived in the \nUnited States for close to 22 years. He finished high school and obtained his college \nand higher education degrees in the United States. Since then, he has been a \nproductive member of the American society and worked diligently for a government \ncontractor. Applicant has travelled to Ghana only four times since 1986 and has casual \nand infrequent contact with extended family members in Ghana. His mother and his two \nsiblings (and their families) are residents and citizens of the United States. Applicant \nclearly has feelings of affection and or obligation towards his father. I do not believe, \nhowever, that Applicant\u2019s feelings are such that they create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation. As discussed above, Ghana\u2019s government does not have a history of \ntargeting American citizens to obtain U.S. information, and there is no evidence \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGhana\u2019s government has ever collected or is collecting U.S. military, economic, or \ntechnical information. Ghana and the United States have diplomatic and economic \nrelations, and the United States is currently assisting Ghana with millions of dollars in \neconomic and technical aid. Under the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant has \nno divided loyalties, and it is not likely he will be vulnerable to pressure, coercion by any \nforeign government. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

On April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJuly 10, 2008\n\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR), at 1-2; Attachments to rebuttal.\n1\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated February 15, 2007) at 1-4, 6.\n2\nId. at 2; Item 3, supra note 1, at 2-5.\n3\nItem 3, supra note 1, at 2.\n4\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 14, 2008. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on April 28, 2008, and requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on May 14, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on May 28,\n2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a response and additional evidence.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on June 23, 2008. The government submitted seven\nexhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-7 and admitted into the record.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 28, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, with explanations. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.1\n \nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as an instructor for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He began his employment with his employer in November 2006.\nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Army for over 22 years. While in\nthe Army, he held a top secret clearance without incident. He also received many\nawards, and retired as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). Applicant and his wife\nmarried in December 1979 and have two children.  \n2\nAfter retiring from the Army, Applicant initially attended school and worked in\nsales. In March 1999, he obtained employment as a computer systems network\nadministrator for a local company. In 2004, this company decided to relocate to another\ncity. At first, Applicant planned to move with the company to the new location. However,\nat the same time, his wife started showing signs of a medical problem. Although she\nsought medical care, the doctors could not identify her illness. His wife was unable to\ncontinue working as a teacher\u2019s assistant, could not drive, and could not be left alone\nfor any period of time (She would try to cook and fires would erupt in the kitchen).\nApplicant\u2019s employment with this company ended in 2004 when it relocated. He chose\nnot to move; instead, he remained to care for his wife as her mental state had\ndeteriorated significantly.  \n3\nWhile working as a network administrator, Applicant started his own business,\nwhich focused on buying and selling houses. He used his personal credit cards to\nfinance the business.4\n\nId.\n5\nRebuttal, Item I (A); Item I (b); Item VIII (A) and (b).\n6\nItem 6 (Supplemental information and interrogatory answers) at 9-14; Rebuttal, Item V (A).\n7\nItem 5 (Credit reports, dated March 19, 2008) at 3; Item 7 (Credit report, dated January 4, 2008) at 3; Rebuttal\n8\n- Items II (A), III (A), V (A) at 3.\n3\nFrom June 2004 until he accepted his current position in November 2006,\nApplicant worked as a custodian, cut lawns, fixed computers, and performed any other\nodd jobs where he could earn money. At the same time, he drove his wife to a variety of\nmedical appointments to determine the cause of her health issues. Doctors have\ndetermined what her medical problem is and have placed her on medication. Her\nmedical condition has improved and she is more self-sufficient, but still not working.\nDuring this time, Applicant\u2019s military retirement pay of $1,200 a month was the family\u2019s\nprimary source of income. He paid his monthly mortgage of $928 and utilities with this\nmoney. His odd jobs paid the rest of the family\u2019s daily living expenses, but provided few\nadditional funds to pay his debts.5\nApplicant provided a copy of his credit report for August 2005. The report reflects\na very good payment history on his debts with almost all debts paid in a timely fashion\nand one or two debts 30 days late once. In July 2005, he sought the assistance of a\ncredit counseling agency. He developed a repayment plan, which required him to pay\n$342 a month to three creditors. He made the monthly payment for five months, but\nstopped because he lacked sufficient income to continue with the agreed upon\npayments.6\nIn December 2007, Applicant consulted with an attorney about filing for\nbankruptcy. Before the attorney could proceed with filing the necessary papers,\nApplicant had to pay him at least $1,125 as set forth in the Bankruptcy rules. He also\nhad to complete a credit counseling program, which he did. Applicant paid the fee and\nthe attorney filed a Petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 6, 2008. His bankruptcy\npetition is proceeding through the courts.7\nApplicant\u2019s gross income from his current job is $3,520 a month and his net pay\nis $2,324 a month. His gross monthly retirement income is $1,700 a month and his net\nmonthly retirement income is $1,333 a month for a total net monthly income of $3,657 a\nmonth. His monthly expenses, including mortgages, utilities, food, and car expenses,\ntotal $3,259, leaving approximately $400 a month.\nApplicant paid the debt listed in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR on June 4, 2008. Except for the\nforeclosure, the remaining debts listed in the SOR are included in his bankruptcy. The\ntwo credit reports submitted by the government reflect a zero balance on the foreclosure\ndebt listed in the reports. Applicant believes that this property was sold in November\n2006 and has provided documentation which supports his position.8\n\nItem 3, supra note 1, at 5-6.\n9\n4\nApplicant\u2019s former employer praised his work skills and described him as a\nperson of integrity, character, and high moral standing.9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2005 and about 20% of his debt remains unpaid, thus it is\nrecent. This mitigating condition is not raised.\nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation may occur when Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose when his wife developed medical problems which doctors could not\nidentify for some period of time. When her condition continued to deteriorate, he could\nnot relocate with his company. Instead, he took care of his wife and pursued medical\ntreatment for her. He worked various odd jobs to help pay the family\u2019s monthly\nexpenses because his retirement income was insufficient to meet all their monthly\nexpenses. He has filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 to eliminate his remaining old\ndebts. He acted reasonably under the circumstances he faced in 2004 and has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\n\n6\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant sought credit counseling in 2005 in\nan effort to gain control over his debts. He made five payments under the repayment\nplan developed through the credit counselors, but stopped the payments because he\nlacked sufficient income to continue with the payments. This mitigating condition\npartially applies. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid\nhis most recent, small debt and established that the foreclosure sale provided the\ncreditor with sufficient funds to pay the mortgage debt. He chose to file bankruptcy as a\nmeans to resolve his remaining old, outstanding debts. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition has some applicability. The remaining mitigating conditions are not\napplicable in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems first\nbegan  when his wife developed an unidentified and thus, untreated illness in 2004,\nwhich forced him to refuse an offer from his employer to relocate to another city. At the\nsame time, his wife\u2019s illness forced her to stop working. As a result, he lost two-thirds of\nhis monthly household income. His military retirement provided enough income to pay\nhis mortgage and utilities, but nothing else. He worked various odd jobs, while caring for\nhis wife, who could not be left alone for long periods of time, and seeking medical care\nfor her. This erratic income maintained other monthly household expenses, but did not\nprovide additional funds to pay old debts, some of which he incurred because he started\n\n7\na business. His inability to pay the business-related debts is directly related to his wife\u2019s\nillness and the loss of income in his household. He attempted to repay his debts in\n2005, but lacked sufficient funds to continue with the payment plan he developed. \nApplicant recently filed bankruptcy, which will eliminate his old debts. While his\nbudget indicates that he has some money to pay his remaining debts, his listed\nexpenses do not account for recent and significant increases in normal everyday\nhousehold expenses. These increased costs will most likely deplete the $400 remaining\neach a month. Had Applicant used the bankruptcy filing fee towards repayment of his\nold debts, this money would have reduced his overall debt by less than 5%. He made a\nchoice on how to resolve his unpaid debts. He deemed bankruptcy as the best, under\nthe facts of this case, for his family. The filing for bankruptcy is not an automatic reason\nfor denial of a security clearance; rather, it is a factor I must consider and I have. \nExcept for the period of time from 2004 to 2006, Applicant has always paid his\nbills and maintained excellent credit. He lives within his financial means, even though\nhis wife still does not work. His debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or\nduress because his overall financial history reflects fiscal responsibility, not\nirresponsibility. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved B it\nis whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance. While some debts remain unpaid because his bankruptcy action has not\nbeen completed, this fact is insufficient to raise security concerns as his major debt, the\nforeclosure, is resolved. With the exception of a two-year period of time, over the last 30\nyears, Applicant has always managed his finances in a prudent and fiscally responsible\nmanner. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 39-year-old electrical engineer employed with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2002. First as a contract employee, then he became a permanent employee in March 2003. He has a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering. He is also a Lieutenant in the United States Navy Reserves. He previously served on active duty in the United States Navy as an enlisted man. He received an Honorable Discharge on February 22, 2001. He received his commission later in 2001. He has held a security clearance since 1997. He is married and has three children, two daughters, ages 8 and 5, and a son, age 3. (Tr at 6-7, 25-26; Gov 1; AE Y at 3.) On July 4, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) He disclosed several delinquent debts in response to section 27 on his questionnaire. A subsequent background investigation confirmed that Applicant had the following delinquent accounts: an $8,873 credit card account that was charged off in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 11); a $776 credit account that was charged off in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 10); a $3,223 credit card account that was charged off in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov",

On June 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 26, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 6, 2008. On August \n15, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for September 11, \n2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered four exhibits which \nwere admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4 without objection. Applicant testified \nand offered 25 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 Y without \nobjection. The transcript was received on September 22, 2008. Based upon a review of \nOctober 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old electrical engineer employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since 2002. First as a contract employee, then he became a \npermanent employee in March 2003. He has a Masters Degree in Electrical \nEngineering. He is also a Lieutenant in the United States Navy Reserves. He previously \nserved on active duty in the United States Navy as an enlisted man. He received an \nHonorable Discharge on February 22, 2001. He received his commission later in 2001. \nHe has held a security clearance since 1997. He is married and has three children, two \ndaughters, ages 8 and 5, and a son, age 3. (Tr at 6-7, 25-26; Gov 1; AE Y at 3.) \n   \nOn July 4, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) He disclosed several delinquent debts in \nresponse to section 27 on his questionnaire. A subsequent background investigation \nconfirmed that Applicant had the following  delinquent accounts:  an $8,873 credit card  \naccount that was charged off in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; \nGov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 11); a $776 credit account that was charged off in August 2002 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 10); a $3,223 credit \ncard account that was charged off in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at \n5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 6); a credit card account that was past due in the approximate \namount of $428 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9); and \na $19,139 credit card account that was placed for collection in October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e; Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 16; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 5).  \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $1,437 credit card account that was \ncharged off as a bad debt in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 \nat 2; Gov 4 at 8); a $2,660 credit card account placed for collection in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 7, 10); a $282 phone account \nthat was placed for collection in December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 10-\n11); a $168 phone account that was past due in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 1, section \n27); and a $29 medical account that was placed for collection in July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: \nGov 1, section 27; Gov 3 at 1). \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was out of work for three months. He found contract work out \nof state in 2002 and worked several months. The contract would terminate and he \nwould be out of work for several weeks. Applicant estimates that he was unemployed \nfor three months in 2002 until he was hired by his current company. During 2001 and \n2002, he and his wife relied on credit cards for living expenses. He was unable to catch \nup with late payments and interest fees. (Tr at 23-24.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn late 2003, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt repayment firm. He \npaid into the debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. (AE A) In 2006, \nhis oldest daughter developed medical problems. She eventually had surgery in late \n2006. His younger daughter had a medical issue which required weekly therapy \nsessions. His son had a surgical procedure in December 2006. Applicant\u2019s extra \nmedical bills made him unable to keep up with payments on his debt repayment plan. \nHe had paid down approximately $20,000 of his debt balance prior to that time. (Tr at \n26-29; AE I; AE J.) \n \nAfter he stopped making payments towards his debt repayment plan, Applicant\u2019s \ndebt balances began to grow as a result of penalties and late fees.  He still attempted to \nresolve his debts with individual creditors but the creditors demanded payments that he \ncould not afford. (Tr at 29.) \n \nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s financial situation became more stable and he began to set \nup payment agreements with some of his creditors.  In May 2008, he entered into a new \nrepayment agreement with the debt repayment firm. Payments began in July 2008. \nApplicant pays $283 monthly into the plan. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, \nare included in the repayment plan. (Tr at 43, 60; AE H; AE I at 1; AE P.)   \n \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, $8,873 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid on this debt \nfrom 2003 to April 2006 during his initial debt repayment plan. He sent a total of $5,087 \nto this account during this time. (AE A at 1-3.) He was unable to reach an agreement \nbetween May 2006 to March 2008. In April 2008, Applicant contacted the creditor and \nentered into an agreement to pay $370 per month over a period of 24 months.  \nPayments started in June 2008. (Tr at 41, 44-45; AE A at 4-5; AE M; AE Q.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $776 charged off credit card account:  Applicant paid on this debt \nfrom December 2003 to April 2006 though his initial debt repayment plan. He paid a \ntotal amount of $1,386.  He attempted to include the creditor on his current debt \nrepayment plan in April 2008. He was not successful so he contacted the creditor and \nset up payment arrangements from May 2008 to November 2008. He made a $115 \npayment in May 2008 and a $35 payment in June 2008. (Tr at 41; AE B; AE L.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $3,223 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid $1,589 in \npayments on this account during his debt repayment plan from 2003 to 2006.  Since \nJanuary 2008, he has been paying $57.57 a month to the agency collecting on behalf of \nthis creditor. (Tr at 32; AE C.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, $428 credit card account that is past due: Applicant paid $1,597 \nduring his initial repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. Applicant made \nvarious payments on this account in February 2007, April 2007, August 2007, \nNovember 2007, January 2008, February 2008, March 2008, and April 2008. In May \n2008, this debt was included in his new repayment plan.  Applicant admits this account  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nremained past due even though payments were made but claims it will soon be \nchanged to current based on the consistent payments that are being made on his debt \nrepayment plan. (Tr at 30; AE D.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $19,139 account placed for collection:  Applicant and his wife \ncharged $7,000 of their wedding expenses on this account. He paid $9,946 towards this \naccount in his previous debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. In \nNovember 2007 and December 2007, he made a $50 payment towards this debt. He \nhas been sending in $200 monthly since January 2008. (Tr at 33, 42; 58; AE E; AE N.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, $1,437 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid this creditor \n$477 under the debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. This account is \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s recent debt repayment plan which began in May 2008. (AE F; AE \nP.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, $2,660 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid this creditor \n$519 under the debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. This account is \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s recent debt repayment plan which began in May 2008. (AE G; \nAE P.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, $282 phone account placed for collection: This account is included in \nApplicant\u2019s recent debt repayment plan which began in May 2008. (AE H; AE P.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, $168 past due phone account: Applicant became aware of this debt in \nJune 2008. He set up a payment arrangement to pay this debt off in three months. He \nwill pay $50 for August and September 2008 and the remaining $68 in October 2008. \n(Tr at 42, 45; AE H; AE O; AE R.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, $29 pediatric medical account placed for collection. Applicant planned \nto resolve this debt at the end of July 2008. He did not become aware of this debt until \nhe reviewed his credit report in June 2008. (Tr at 38; AE I.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $5,635 which includes his reserve income. His \nwife does not work.  Monthly expenses include rent: $1,400, groceries: $300, utilities: \n$454, \nclothing: \n$100, \ncar \nexpenses: \n$492, \nmedical: \n$150, \nalimony/child \nsupport/daycare: $400, miscellaneous expenses: $740. His car payments are $308.61 \nand $358.21. His total monthly expenses are $4,702.82. Assuming Applicant paid off \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j, his monthly debt payments total $931.  This \nleaves $1.18 left over after expenses. (Tr at 57-58; Gov 2 at 10-11.)  \n \nIt is likely that Applicant may have more money left over each month after \nexpenses.  He listed $740 in miscellaneous expenses, a rather high figure. In \nparentheses next to this figure he indicated \u201cexplanation included\u201d but no explanation \nwas included in Gov 2. In addition, he listed $400 for alimony/child support/daycare. \nHowever, it does not appear that Applicant was previously married and/or had a child \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfrom a previous relationship. Considering that his wife does not work, a $400 monthly \ndaycare expense seems unlikely. (Gov 2 at 10.)   \n \nApplicant never tried to hide his financial situation. He is current on his federal \ntaxes. He follows a budget. His children\u2019s medical problems have improved. When he \nentered into the debt management program, he was provided a compact disk which \ncontained a program on how the manage one\u2019s finances. Applicant also reads books on \nfinancial management. He is committed to resolving his debts. (Tr at 52, 56; 61-62.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Pastor wrote a letter on his behalf. Applicant is a member in good \nstanding at the church who serves as a role model for youth and adults. He is devoted \nto his family, job and country. He was recommended to become a Deacon based on his \ncharacter. He has held numerous offices in the church. (AE S.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has supervised Applicant over the past six years. He is \npleased with his work and dedication.  He spent many hours above and beyond the call \nof duty to ensure timely completion of critical tasks on the projects he has worked on. \nHe can works well with other team members and can be relied on to \u201cget things done.\u201d \nHe recommends him for a security clearance. (AE T.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s commanding officer in the United States Navy Reserves states \nApplicant has done an outstanding job as executive officer over the past 17 months. He \ntakes a personal interest in the professional and private lives of all unit members.  He \nhas high ethics, morals and ideals. His commander recommends that his security \nclearance be continued. (AE U.) His commanding officer from October 2004 to October \n2007, recommends reinstatement of his security clearance. He notes Applicant has \nalways been rated as one of the unit\u2019s top performers. He is a trustworthy and \noutstanding officer. (AE V.) Another former commander indicates Applicant served as \nhis assistant training officer.  He was very organized and kept track of the unit members\u2019 \ntravel and training.  He claims Applicant is one of the best junior officers that he has \nworked with in over 29 years of active and reserve navy service. (AE W.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s fitness reports both enlisted and officer state Applicant meets or is \nabove standards. (AE X.) His awards and decorations include the Navy and Marine \nCorps Achievement Medal. In February 1999, he was awarded the Division Outstanding \nTeam Builder Award. (AE Y.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nApplicant has accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt since 2001. The \nSOR alleges ten debts, an approximate total balance of $37,015.  While some \nmitigating factors apply to Applicant\u2019s case, most of the delinquent debts are credit card \naccounts. His excessive indebtedness indicates that he and his wife have consistently \nspent beyond their means.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant \ninitially enrolled in a debt repayment program in 2003. He was unable to complete the \nprogram and stopped paying some of his accounts in December 2006. He recently \nentered into another debt repayment plan and has entered into repayment agreements \nwith other creditors who are not included in the plan. However, he recently entered into \nthese repayment agreements. Given his history of financial irresponsibility, it is too soon \nto conclude Applicant developed a track record of financial stability. FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment in 2001 and 2002 contributed to his financial problems. To his credit, he \nentered a debt repayment plan in 2003 and consistently made payments until April 2006 \nwhen he was unable to continue the plan because of his three children\u2019s medical \n\n \n8 \n \n \nissues. His periods of unemployment and his children\u2019s health issues are certainly \nfactors that were beyond his control. In 2008, Applicant started to deal with his debt \nagain and has entered into repayment agreements with each of his creditors. He has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. Applicant received financial counseling when he entered his debt \nrepayment agreement. He established a budget and entered into repayment plans with \neach of his creditors. Admittedly, Applicant\u2019s budget is rather tight and he has a long \nway to go to complete his repayment plans, but his financial situation is beginning to \nstabilize. Applicant is given credit for having a plan to resolve his debts. However, \nconsidering the extent of the debt it will take some time for the delinquent debts to be \nresolved.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. From December 2003 to April 2006, \nApplicant consistently made payments towards his first debt repayment plan. His \nchildren\u2019s health issues prevented him from continuing the plan. His financial situation \nhas stabilized and he re-enrolled in a debt repayment plan which includes four of the  \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He entered into repayment agreements with the six remaining \ndebts. He has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his overdue accounts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s supervisor, commanders, and Pastor. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nrecord in the United States Navy both as an officer and as an enlisted man. I considered  \nApplicant\u2019s difficulty in finding a stable and well paying job in 2001/2002. I considered \nthat he was faithfully making payments towards a debt management plan from April \n2003 to December 2006 until the financial burdens of his children\u2019s medical issues \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmade him unable to make payments.  As soon as his financial situation stabilized, he \nestablished a plan to pay his delinquent accounts. While it may take some time for \nApplicant to resolve his delinquent accounts, he has taken adequate measures to \ncontrol his financial situation in the future. The recommendations of Applicant\u2019s Pastor, \nsupervisor, and past and present commanders indicate Applicant is reliable, trustworthy, \nand able to protect classified information. For these reasons, Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On February 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to be proceed on April 16, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on April 21, 2008. On May 5, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for May 28, 2008. The case was heard on \nthat date. The Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4 without objection. The Applicant offered two exhibits which were \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 B without objection. Applicant and her husband, \nJuly 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwho also served as her personal representative testified.  The record was held open \nuntil June 18, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted a 13-page document which was admitted as AE C without objection. The \ntranscript was received on June 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  She has been employed as a security guard with the \ndefense contractor since May 2007. She has an associates degree in applied science.  \nShe is married. She has three children from a prior marriage, a daughter, age nineteen, \nwho has a son, age two; and two sons, ages 17 and 14. Her husband has a son, age \n17, and an 11-year-old daughter who lives with her mother. (Tr at 24-25, 47-48, 64; Gov \n1.)   \nOn May 20, 2008, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) A subsequent background investigation revealed that \nApplicant had the following  delinquent accounts:  a $101 account that was placed for \ncollection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Gov 3 at 1.); a $4,689 delinquent account placed \nfor collection in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 8.); a $144 satellite \ntelevision account that was placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 3 at \n1.); a $3,757 department store credit card account that was charged off in July 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d; Gov 3 at 1-2; Gov 4 at 10.); and a $3,263 delinquent account that was \ncharged off in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9-10.).  In September 2005, \nApplicant defaulted on her mortgage. Her house was foreclosed in October 2006. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f; Gov 4 at 7.)  \n \nOn July 5, 2005, Applicant filed for divorce from her previous husband.  The \ndivorce was final on November 23, 2005. (AE C at 5-11.)  At the time of the divorce, she \nwas supporting three children and her grandson.  She had difficulty meeting her \nfinancial obligations which resulted in her home foreclosure and several delinquent \naccounts. (Tr at 24.) She and her ex-husband also struggled financially as a result of \nperiods of unemployment.  Her ex-husband was laid off for three months in November \n2001.  She was laid off in 2002 for about a month. (Tr at 61-63.)      \n \nWhen Applicant discovered that her job required a security clearance she began \nto pay off her debts.  Her current husband holds a clearance and holds a job involving \nsecurity.  He advised her that she needed to resolve her delinquent accounts in order to \nmaintain a security clearance. (Tr at 45, 52-53.) It took a few months for her to actually \nstart resolving her delinquent accounts because they needed to assess the family \nfinances after moving in together. She and her husband keep their finances separate \nbecause he has good credit.  Her husband has advised her on how to resolve her \ndelinquent debt. (Tr at 53 -56.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant resolved several accounts that were not alleged in the SOR.  The debts \ninclude a $59 medical bill; a $24 account; a $683 account. Her student loan was past \ndue $181.  Her student loans are now current. (Tr at 17-18; Gov 2.) They paid off \nseveral of the smaller accounts before dealing with the larger accounts. \n \nThe current status of the accounts are:   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, $101 collection account: Paid off in February 2008. (Tr at 19-20; Gov \n2 at 6, 18.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $4,689 collection account: Applicant paid $100 on February 8, 2008 \nand on March 8, 2008. (Gov 2 at 10; AE C at 13.) Applicant and the company then \nentered into a settlement agreement. Applicant wrote checks that were provided to the \ncollection agency to cash each month. The monthly payment is approximately $377.03 \nand will be paid off in February 25, 2009. (Tr at 34-35; AE A at 10.) The first check in \nthe amount of $380 was cashed on April 25, 2008. (Tr at 21, 34; AE A at 1, 9-10; AE C \nat 13.)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $144 satellite television collection account: Paid on April 10, 2008.  \n(Tr at 21-22, 40-41; AE A at 6.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, $3,757 charged off department store credit card account: Agreed to \npay $250 per month. Applicant began making monthly payments in March 2008. Timely  \npayments were made in March, April, and May 2008 (Tr at 22-23, 41-43; AE A at 2, 4, \n7-8; AE C at 4.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $3,623 charged off account: Agreed to pay $250 per month. \nPayments have been made for March, April and May 2008. The account was a line of \ncredit that Applicant and her ex-husband took out in order to satisfy their homeowner\u2019s \nassociation demands to install a backyard fence and grass. Her ex-husband is not \npaying his half of the account. (Tr at 43-46; AE A at 4; AE C at 4; Gov 2 at 20.)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreclosed home was sold about six months after she moved out \n(approximately April 2007). She owed $182,000 on the mortgage. The home sold for \napproximately $194,000. She provided her contact information to the mortgage \ncompany. So far, she has received no notification of a deficiency judgment related to \nthe mortgage. (Tr at 24, 63-65.)   \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant paid off a car loan. As a result, she has $400 in extra \nincome each month to apply towards her debts.  Applicant uses her income to pay her \ndebts. Her husband pays the household expenses. (Tr at 56-60.) After expenses, to \ninclude the delinquent accounts where she entered into payment agreements, she has \napproximately $410 left over each month. (AE C at 2.) Her husband has approximately \n$620 left over each month after expenses. He holds a part-time job which brings in an \nextra $650 per month, which is included in the above figure. (AE C at 3.)   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant pays her daughter\u2019s car insurance, cell phone and occasionally gives \nher money for food. She provides a total of $200 to $250 a month to her daughter. Her \ndaughter attends college and is expecting her second child. (Tr at 47-48.) \n \nApplicant is well-regarded at work. The account program manager states that \nApplicant has been an exemplary performer who has volunteered for additional shifts. \nShe easily grasps difficult tasks and demonstrates good judgment. She is a valued \nasset to the company and her peers. (AE B at 1.) Her site manager states that she \ndemonstrates amazing initiative and dedication.  She displays a high degree of integrity, \nresponsibility, and ambition. (AE B at 2.)  Several co-workers comment favorably on her \nintegrity, work ethic, trustworthiness, and willingness to help others. (AE B at 3-5.)  In \nApril 2008, she received special mention during an Air Force Inspector General \ninspection of the company. (AE B at 6.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant accumulated several \ndelinquent debts. The SOR alleges five debts, an approximate total balance of $12,314. \nAfter her divorce, she fell behind in her house payments resulting in her home being \nforeclosed in October 2006.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Most of the \ndelinquent debts resulted from Applicant\u2019s divorce in 2005.  She has demonstrated her \nreliability and trustworthiness by taking steps to resolve the delinquent accounts. While \nnot all the debts are paid, she entered into repayment plans with the accounts that \nremain delinquent and is making payments towards those accounts.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.  Most of the financial problems \nwere the result of Applicant\u2019s 2005 divorce. During their marriage, she and her ex-\nhusband occasionally encountered financial difficulties due to periodic lay-offs. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. She paid off the smaller accounts \nand has entered in to repayment plans for the debts that have larger balances. She is \nliving within her means. \n  \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant did not attend financial counseling. However, it is \nnoted that Applicant\u2019s current husband has been proactive in helping Applicant resolve \nher financial problems. If she continues to follow the terms of her repayment plans, her \nlarger debts will be paid off in February 2009. Based on the steps she has taken to \nresolve her delinquent accounts, it is likely her financial situation will be resolved within \na year.    \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant resolved four debts prior to the \nSOR being issued. She paid two of the accounts and has entered into repayment plans \nwith the three remaining debtors. It can take time after a divorce to get one\u2019s financial \naffairs in order.  Once Applicant\u2019s financial situation improved, she initiated a good-faith \neffort to resolve her delinquent accounts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s superiors and co-workers. I considered the impact that her \n2005 divorce had on her financial situation, and her efforts to resolve her delinquent \n\n \n7 \n \n \naccounts. She has mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nDuring the 2004/05 time frame, Applicant failed to protect classified and special\naccess program information while employed as a security manager for a defense\ncontractor. She knowingly failed to maintain proper accountability of some top-secret\nclassified documents, and exposed classified and special access restricted information\nto possible compromise by storing it in a vault accessed by employees not briefed to the\nprogram. Data was placed on a local area network (LAN) within her security cognizance\nin violation of a co-utilization agreement and the system\u2019s protection level. The evidence\nof reform is insufficient to overcome the serious concerns regarding the handling of\nprotected information. But personal conduct concerns are not established in the\nabsence of proof that Applicant acted with the intent to conceal or withhold classified\nmaterial from government inspectors. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on January 27, 2004. On October 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nApril 28, 2010\n\nApplicant objected to exhibits 3, 4, 7, and 9.b on the basis that the signatory for the MSAPSO was\n1\na contractor and not authorized to act on behalf of the military security office. Applicant was offered an\nopportunity to present evidence after her hearing to support her contention, but at the close of her case, she\nelected not to request to leave the record open because she did not believe the government would provide\nher with the information. She objected to Exhibit 5 to the extent that it contained opinions of the investigator.\nHer concerns were noted in evaluating the weight to be afforded the information in the document. Applicant\nobjected to exhibit 6, a report of inquiry conducted by the MSAPSO,  on the basis that information had been\nredacted from the document. Since the redaction was only of program/LAN identifying information that would\nhave been within the knowledge of the Applicant, I accepted the MSAPSO report into evidence. The cognizant\nsecurity agency has an obligation to ascertain whether classified information is adequately protected.\n2\nsecurity concerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and Guideline E,\npersonal conduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her a\nsecurity clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 13, 2008, and she requested a\nhearing. On July 28, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. On September 1, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for October 27, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Ten Government exhibits (Ex. 1-10) were\noffered into evidence. Exhibits 9 and 10 consisted of four separate documents that were\nmarked as Ex. 9.a-9.d and 10.a-10.d for ease of reference. Applicant did not object to\nExhibits 1, 2, 8, 9.a, 9.c, 9.d, 10.a, and 10.c, and those documents were admitted.\nExhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.b were accepted into the record over Applicant\u2019s objections.1\nApplicant also objected to the inclusion of those documents marked as Ex. 10.b and\n10.d. The Government withdrew those documents. Applicant offered nine exhibits (Ex.\nA-I) that were admitted without objection, and she testified, as reflected in a transcript\n(Tr.) received on November 4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline K, handling protected information, that the\nmilitary found Applicant responsible for two security violations following an inspection of\na sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) around October 2004 (SOR 1.a);\nthat Applicant\u2019s special access privileges were suspended by her employer (SOR 1.b)\nand by a U.S. military special access program security office (MSAPSO) (SOR 1.c) in\nJanuary 2005 pending an investigation into noncompliance with a co-utilization\nagreement involving special access programs (SAPs) at Applicant\u2019s facility; and that the\nMSAPSO office found Applicant culpable in April 2005 of: (1) direct involvement in the\nmishandling of top secret/special access program (TS/SAP) materials, (2) contributing\nto the unauthorized exposure of classified special access material to \u201cnon-accessed\u201d\n(unauthorized) individuals, (3) knowingly violating established co-utilization agreements\n\n3\nby using an unauthorized local area network (LAN), and (4) willfully withholding\nclassified material from cognizant security authority (CSA) inspection or oversight or\nboth (SOR 1.d). DOHA alleged that as a result of those findings, the MSAPSO\nrecommended in June 2005 that her access to special access programs be revoked\n(SOR 1.e). The willful withholding of classified material from the CSA was cross-alleged\nunder Guideline E (SOR 2.a).\nIn her Answer, Applicant denied that she was issued a security violation as a\nresult of the inspection conducted of the SCIF in October 2004 (SOR 1.a). Concerning\nthe alleged violation of the co-utilization agreement (SOR 1.b and 1.c), Applicant\nadmitted the actions taken by her employer and the U.S. military to suspend her access,\nbut she denied any authority over the LAN involved. Applicant denied she mishandled\nTS/SAP materials (SOR 1.d). Applicant asserted that once she discovered that TS/SAP\nmaterial was not in proper accountability, she made every effort to bring it under proper\ncontrols and to notify the SAP\u2019s security officials. She took steps to ensure that\nunauthorized personnel were not exposed to SAP information by separating\ncombination logs, and physically moving material to a locked area. She also denied any\nwillful withholding of classified material from CSA oversight (SOR 1.d(4) and 2.a),\ninasmuch as she was the first security manager to list all areas, including that which\nhoused the SAP material, on the inspection report submitted to the inspection team\nbefore its arrival.\nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been\nemployed in the engineering department as a configuration management specialist\nsince June 2005. (Ex. 2) She started working for her employer in October 1984, initially\nas an inspector in final assembly involving a military SAP (hereafter SAP X). She moved\nto another program as an inspector, where she worked until May 1988, when she\nbecame a security aide in the special security office (SAPSO) under the supervision of a\nsecurity manager (hereafter security manager A). (Ex. 1, I, Tr. 120-21.) In August 1995,\nApplicant left the company. She returned to work for the defense contractor in February\n1999 in the position of security aide involved in automated information systems (AIS).\n(Ex. 1, 2, 5.) Around August 1999, Applicant was granted a TS security clearance for\nher duties. (Ex. 9.b.)\nApplicant lacked the technical expertise to perform the AIS security duties\nrequired, so in about January 2000, she went back to the SAPSO where she performed\nadministrative work at a junior level. (Ex. 2, Tr. 89, 125-26.) In March 2000, Applicant\nwas briefed into SAP X. She initially split her time between that SAP program and\ninformation technology security for a different program. Applicant learned about security\non the job, and was given no formal security training. She was provided an automated\ninformation security account, and her duties involved correcting deficiencies and\nmaintaining receipt and dispatch records. (Ex. 5) Applicant worked under security\nmanager A, who was the Contractor Program Security Officer (CPSO) for SAP X. (Tr.\n\nSAP X involved collateral, SAP/SAR, and SCI information. Applicant testified that she was placed\n2\nin charge of the SAP/SAR material in 2004. (Tr. 105.)\nApplicant explained that there was a misinterpretation within the SCI facility that TS/SCI did not need\n3\naccountability, but that under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) overprint,\naccountability of TS is required. (Tr. 90.) See NISPOM \u00b6 5-201.a, which mandates TS control officials to\nmaintain accountability records for TS information and to conduct an inventory annually.\n4\n124-26.) In October 2001, Applicant was cleared for access to sensitive compartmented\ninformation (SCI). (Ex. 1.)\nDuring a 2002 government security review of SAP X at the facility, TS\naccountability was determined to be insufficient, and that all TS program material\nneeded to be accounted for by the CPSO. In April 2002, Applicant was promoted to a\nsecurity representative position, which meant for her a loss of overtime pay, and in May\n2002, she was designated as CPSO for SAP X. Her manager transitioned out of the\noffice and became the manager of special programs security (Ex. 2, 5, 9.c.). Applicant\nreceived no formal training on what was required of her in her now senior security\nposition (Tr. 127.), although apparently the government customer assessed her as\nqualified for the position. Applicant was confident in her ability to perform the duties of\nCPSO with the single exception of the information technology area (\u201cI knew the\nNISPOM backwards and forwards . . . I was a great security officer\u201d). (Tr. 129-30.) Work\ncontinued on multiple programs in the area and on the same information technology\nsystem as Applicant assumed all co-users had agreed. Around August 8, 2003,\nApplicant was promoted to a security manager position. She had security\nresponsibilities for approximately 20 separate SAPs in the area (Tr. 114.), including\nSAP X which had by then more than 200 cleared personnel and seven full-time\nsubcontractors involved and 13 separate areas to maintain. Security manager A\nretained control over staffing issues. (Ex. 2, Tr. 92-93.) There were only three ISSM\u2019s\ncleared for all the SAPs at the facility. (Ex. G.) While Applicant was a TS control officer\nand CPSO for SAP X, security issues surfaced involving SAP X, as follows.\nDocument Accountability Issues\nWhen Applicant took over as CPSO for SAP X in May 2002, a significant amount\nof SAP X material was within the control of a special security officer with cognizance\nover SCI (hereafter the CSSO).  Previous security staff had treated all the material as\n2\nSCI that required no accountability, when in fact there was special access required\n(SAR) material mixed in which required accountability.  (Ex. 2.) Applicant wanted all\n3\nSAP X material within her area of cognizance. The CSSO resisted, but in late 2002, a\ndecision was made to relocate all SAP X material from the vault to the SAP X area.\nMost of the material was eventually moved from the vault to the SAP X area in the\nspring of 2003. Due to closed storage space constraints within SAP X approved areas,\nsome oversized material remained in the vault. The material included very large reel-to-\nreel tapes that were marked TS/SAR. (Tr. 107.) Neither Applicant nor security manager\nA brought those materials now in the SAP X area under accountability. Safes brought to\nthe SAP X area \u201csat stagnant for many months\u201d because of work demands, staffing\nissues, and the lack of any requests for the material. (Ex. 9.c.)\n\nApplicant indicated that she and a security associate discovered in the spring of 2004 that the\n4\ndocument control numbers were inconsistent on SAP X material that had been brought from the CSSO\u2019s area.\nDue to computer issues, they were not able to confirm whether documents had been placed in accountability.\nIn the administrative inquiry, the investigator reported that security manager A and Applicant admitted being\naware of the existence of \u201chundreds of pieces\u201d of accountable material outside of accountability. Applicant\ntestified it was \u201cthousands of pieces\u201d of classified material. (Ex. 9.c.) Because of the volume, she asked for\nan extension of 180 days, but was given only 30. (Tr. 106-07.)\nApplicant indicated that most of the actual logging of the material was accomplished by security\n5\nassociates in her office. During the investigation, she provided a statement indicating that when the task was\naccomplished, she set a letter to the government indicating all classified material had been logged. (Ex. 9.c.)\n5\nIn the spring of 2004, Applicant and a security associate began looking at the\nmaterial moved from the CSSO\u2019s office. Problems with document control involving\nmaterials removed from the vault led Applicant to inform the cognizant MSAPSO in late\nApril 2004 that a significant volume of accountable TS classified material pertaining to\nSAP X had not yet been brought into accountability.  (Ex. 2, Tr. 90.) The company was\n4\ngiven a deadline of 30 days, which was later extended, to bring the material into\naccountability. A mass inventory was conducted in June 2004. Since Applicant was not\nfully cleared to the level of all the materials in the vault (Tr. 109.), the CSSO for the\nSCIF performed the inventory. (Ex. 10.c.) In late July 2004, Applicant notified the\nMSAPSO that her office had established a new accountability system, and that all\ndocuments and media had been brought into accountability as required.  Applicant also\n5\nindicated that the company had educated all employees regarding the handling,\nstorage, and accountability requirements for TS material. (Ex. 9.c.). Some classified,\nspecial access required reel-to-reel tapes were cut up and placed in bags that were left\non a cart in the vault because the shredder broke before they could be destroyed. (Tr.\n108.) According to Applicant, she kept SAP X\u2019s program security officer apprised of\nmatters within her cognizance. (Tr. 109.)\nFollowing a government security review (reinspection) in late January 2005, a\n100% inventory was conducted of all items logged into accountability. Two items (a\nfloppy diskette and a Zip disk) labeled TS could not be located. After an internal\ninvestigation, both media were found to be classified secret/NOFORN, and incorrectly\nentered into TS accountability. (Ex. 9.c)\nIn mid-January 2005, Applicant was replaced as CPSO for SAP X due to issues\ninvolving a LAN in her office, infra. On January 27, 2005, the CSSO for the SCIF at the\ncompany reported to the new CPSO for SAP X that there was classified material\npertaining to SAP X in his vault. Because SAP X TS material had been outside of\naccountability between 2002 and 2004, an internal inquiry was conducted by company\nsecurity to determine the facts surrounding what appeared to be inadequate\naccountability of TS material. (Ex. 9.c, 10.c.) The SAP materials in the vault included 8\nmillimeter tapes, reel-to-reel tapes, floppy disks, and other media and documents, which\nranged  in classification from Secret/SAR to TS/SAR/SI. The investigator determined\nthere was SAP X material in the vault that should have been brought into accountability\nat the time of the mass inventory completed in 2004. Some of the items found had\ndocument control numbers from the previous accountability system used in the SCIF.\n\nIn his memorandum of January 17, 2005, the information systems employee indicated he was hired\n6\nas the information system security officer (ISSO). He was referred to as the ISSM (information system security\nmanager) in the records documenting the investigation. He was a certified information systems security\nprofessional (CISSP), and Applicant was not. Applicant testified that she had been told by security manager\nA to stay out of computer security issues. (Tr. 115-18.) \n6\nOne item found had been erroneously listed in accountability as having been destroyed,\nalthough there was no corresponding certificate of destruction for the material. SAP X\u2019s\ngovernment program security officer and the MSAPSO with local oversight were notified\nof the unapproved storage in early February 2005, and the materials were secured.\nApplicant was among five employees identified as having had cognizance of the SAP X\nmaterial and having failed to follow administrative procedures. In reporting the incident\nto the MSAPSO on March 2, 2005, the company indicated that those involved would\nreceive a verbal warning concerning the improper storage and counseled about the\nresponsibility to report security violations within their cognizance to the appropriate\npersons within the company and the government. (Ex. 10.c.)\nLAN Issues\nIn early May 2003, an information system security manager (ISSM)  was hired for\n6\nSAP X. His chain of command was within information technology security, and Applicant\nhad no supervisory authority over him. (Tr. 101) The security network within Applicant\u2019s\noffice was operating on old equipment and on an accreditation from May 2000 for joint\nusage. Around May 23, 2003, two branches of the U.S. military with special access\nprograms in Applicant\u2019s office (customers #1 and #2) executed a co-utilization\nagreement giving customer #2 cognizant authority over the security space. The newly\nhired ISSM was told by his manager in information technology security that the co-\nutilization agreement covered AIS. (Ex. 5.)\nAround August 2003, Applicant had arranged for SAP X (customer #3) to buy a\nnew computer system (PC and server) for her office to support the program. The ISSM\nfor SAP X submitted a plan to the cognizant MSAPSO for an AIS upgrade with a new\noperating system and hardware. The plan referenced the May 2003 co-utilization\nagreement, and specified that only customer #2's SAPs would be on the network. Work\ninvolving other services would be performed on stand-alone, dedicated systems. Based\non his conversations with Applicant, the ISSM understood that there was very little\nactivity involving other branches of the U.S. military. In October 2003, the MSAPSO\napproved the plan dedicating the network to customer #2\u2019s programs only. On the\nimplementation of the new LAN in early March 2004, the data from the old network was\nplaced on the new server without clearly identifying the programs or security levels of\nthe information on the LAN. (Ex. 5.) Applicant was a user of the LAN in her security\ncognizance but she did not have administrative rights to the LAN. (Tr. 95.)\nIn the summer of 2004, the MSAPSO notified the ISSM that the co-utilization\nagreement for the new LAN did not cover AIS issues. Applicant again told the ISSM that\n\nDuring the investigation of the LAN problem in mid-January 2005, the ISSM indicated that Applicant\n7\ntold him that the old security network did not have any classified material on it. W hen the co-use problem was\nbeing addressed in the summer of 2004, he asked Applicant what information was on the LAN from other\nservices and she indicated basic security administration information, receipt and dispatch records, and\nunclassified \u201cHVSACO\u201d information. In November 2004, he asked Applicant about the security level of material\nto be processed on the LAN, and she indicated unclassified HVSACO information to confidential/special\naccess required. (Ex. 2.)  Applicant testified discrepantly that when updated hardware was approved to the\nLAN in 2004, the ISSM labeled the LAN S/SAR because the system contained S/SAR information pertaining\nto SAP X. (Tr. 95.)\nThe government program security officer for SAP X is distinct from the military special access\n8\nprogram security office, which apparently had cognizance over SAP security issues involving its service\u2019s\nSAPs and not solely SAP X.\nThe co-utilization agreement was apparently signed by two customers on September 23, 2004, by\n9\na third on September 27, 2004, and by the fourth on October 12, 2004. (Ex. 2)\nApplicant\u2019s testimony that her area had only two minor findings in the area of physical security is\n10\ninconsistent with her demands for the ISSM\u2019s time because SAP X had some major issues.\n7\nthe network contained no program technical information from other services.  Around\n7\nAugust 23, 2004, the government program manager for SAP X  gave the ISSM special\n8\napproval authority to include new nodes on the network, although the program manager\nretained overall authority for accrediting the network. (Ex. A.) In early October 2004, a\nnew co-utilization agreement was effective with the final signature by four SAP\ncustomers,  stating that all data other than customer #2 data would be maintained on\n9\ndedicated systems. During a companywide special access facility inspection by\nMSAPSO in October 2004, the facility was given a marginal rating. The information\ntechnology program was rated as unsatisfactory. (Ex. 2, Tr. 92.) Applicant testified that\nher program, SAP X, had only minor deficiencies which involved physical security\nissues (Tr. 92.). Evidence shows the co-utilization agreement on the LAN had to be\nrevised to include a fifth customer (signatory). (Ex. 9.c.)\nIn November 2004, Applicant\u2019s employer submitted a request to the MSAPSO to\nmodify the co-utilization agreement on the LAN in her area to allow the use of AIS to\nsupport all signatories. Applicant expressed concerns in December 2004 about the\nISSM\u2019s time being spent on programs other than SAP X when SAP X had \u201cmajor\nissues\u201d that needed to be addressed before a government re-inspection.  (Ex. F.) The\n10\nISSM had been selected to head the re-inspection team for information security for all of\nthe programs within MSAPSO\u2019s cognizance at the facility. (Tr. 97.) One of the LANs\nwas running at the TS/SAR level to seven subcontractors and Applicant needed the\nISSM to maintain the LAN. Applicant complained to information technology\nmanagement, including the team leader in charge of the corrective action plan, that SAP\nX was not being adequately staffed. (Tr. 98)\nOn December 19, 2004, the team leader in charge of the corrective action plan\nexpressed concerns to top security officials in the company about a security culture in\nthe SAP/SAR security department that favored longtime employees over efforts to\ncorrect security issues. (Ex. G) In early January 2005, the ISSM notified the company of\nhis intent to resign. (Tr. 100.) On January 12, 2005, the ISSM provided the MSAPSO\n\nApplicant maintains that the ISSM was responsible for the LAN found to be in violation. Yet, his\n11\naccess was not suspended. (Tr. 100-01.) She assumes that the ISSM knew the LAN was not going to pass\non the reinspection, and that he called in the MSAPSO investigator to divert the attention from him to her. (Tr.\n102.) No disciplinary action was taken against the ISSM.\n8\nwith the configuration of the LAN that was approved to support only customer #2. The\nnext day, the MSAPSO conducted a site visit and determined that the LAN was\noperating in violation of its protection level I accreditation and in violation of the co-\nutilization agreement for the facility. The LAN was suspended from operations and all\nuser accounts but the ISSM\u2019s account  were locked based on suspicions of multiple\n11\nSAP cognizant security agency data being commingled on the AIS. Applicant\u2019s special\naccess was suspended by her employer (Ex. 5, 9.a, 9.c.) and by the MSAPSO as to the\nSAPs under its security cognizance pending an investigation. (Ex. 3, 4, 6.) Applicant\nwas also formally suspended from her duties as CPSO for SAP X. (Ex. 10.c.)\nAn internal investigation was conducted over the next few days by Applicant\u2019s\nemployer during which it was determined that the ISSM, Applicant, and three other\nsecurity associates in the office had established accounts on the LAN and had\nconfirmed access to data files on the system. Applicant expressed her belief to the\ninvestigator that data maintained on the server was not technical in nature, but included\nsterile addresses, receipt and dispatch records, TS accountability registries, access\nlists, forms, correspondence, and other unclassified security-related documents. She\ntold the investigator that she assumed that the LAN was approved to the S/SAR level,\nand she received assurances from the ISSM when the new server was added that all\nhad been approved. In her mind, the ISSM was responsible for the LAN. Security\nmanager A did not have an account on the LAN, and she believed the ISSM and\nApplicant shared security responsibility for the system, although there was a general\nopinion in the SAPSO that security manager A did not provide adequate direction or\noversight of the security office. Due to inadequate documentation, the investigator could\nnot fully establish a trail showing approval of the AIS LAN and the co-utilization\nagreement. (Ex. 5, 9.c.)\nOn January 18, 2005, the MSAPSO reviewed the data, both shared and local, on\nthe LAN server and local client hard drives. In addition to unclassified information\npertaining to several of its contracts, to old or unrecognized SAP contracts pertaining to\nactivity outside the current co-utilization agreement, and database files that supported\ncurrent and past SAP customers, the MSAPSO found classified information up to the\nTS/SAR level, and classified associations in receipt and dispatch databases, which was\noutside the approved accreditation (protection level 1) for the LAN and in violation of the\nexisting co-utilization agreement for the facility. The MSAPSO could not rule out the\npossibility of compromise of classified data since all users had not been approved for\naccess to the data on the system. The security LAN would have to be formally dis-\naccredited and any affected media destructed. (Ex. 6, 9.c.)\n\n9\nLaptop Issue\nSometime during the latter half of 2004, the ISSM found seven laptops in SAP\nX\u2019s area. The laptops were not marked on the outside, and hard drives were not marked\non those computers that had hard drives. He secured the laptops and notified the\ngovernment and Applicant about the laptops. Applicant knew that the previous ISSO\nhad two laptops that were unclassified and used for travel. She assumed there was a\npolicy in place for the laptops to be held in the SAR area. After she was told about the\nother laptops in 2004, she assumed they came from an unclassified area and relied on\nthe ISSM to obtain procedures for the use of the laptops in the SAR area. (Ex. 9.c.)\nAfter an eighth laptop was found during the government\u2019s re-inspection in January\n2005, the company conducted an internal investigation into the laptops. In a document\ndated May 2001, the cognizant security office had provided one-time-use approval on a\ncase-by-case basis, but the approval did not specify a laptop by serial number or\ninclude the appropriate form. Two hard drives containing classified material were of the\ncorrect model for the laptops, but it could not be validated whether those hard drives\nwere from the laptops approved for one-time use. Of the two laptops that had internal\nhard drives, only one could be accessed and a basic search returned no results that\nwould indicate classified material was on the laptop. Because of turnover in the SAP\nsecurity department and poor record keeping, individual responsibility could not be\ndetermined. (Ex. 10.a.)\nAdministrative Inquiry\nFollowing its review of the incident involving the LAN, the MSAPSO issued a\nmemorandum on April 4, 2005, notifying Applicant\u2019s employer that her SAP accesses\nremained suspended pending a final adjudication of her clearance eligibility. The\nMSAPSO determined that as TS control officer, Applicant was directly involved in the\nmishandling of TS/SAP materials, that her actions contributed to the unauthorized\nexposure of classified SAP material to non-accessed individuals, that she knowingly\nviolated established co-utilization agreements between DoD services through the use of\nan unauthorized LAN, and that she willfully withheld classified materials from CSA\ninspection and/or oversight. (Ex. 7.)\nOver the March to June 2005 time frame, the company conducted its inquiry into\nthe security issues involving SAP X at the facility. Applicant was interviewed over the\nMarch 16 to 18, 2005 time frame about the unaccountable documents. Applicant\naverred that she had told security manager A and the CSSO when she took over\nsecurity responsibilities for SAP X in 2002 that all SAP X material had to be brought\nunder her cognizance, but the CSSO wanted to retain the TS material. Applicant\nadmitted that after management decided to relocate the material from the vault to her\nprogram area, SAP material resided in the program area outside of accountability until\nshe notified the government. Applicant explained that the delay in obtaining the program\nmaterial and bringing it into accountability was due to lack of management oversight\nand support, including from security manager A, and a lack of trained personnel to\nconduct daily operations. She indicated that an effort was made to identify material for\ndestruction back in 2003, but that \u201cwith the multitude of issues going on at the time,\n\n10\nunderstaffing, and having no destruction facility,\u201d items sat waiting for destruction. (Ex.\n9.c.)\nOn March 21, 2005, Applicant was interviewed about the laptops. She\nexpressed no knowledge of unclassified laptops being used or stored in SAR areas.\nShe provided a written statement the following day in which she explained that she\nlearned about the laptops when she came onto the program, and she assumed that\nthere was a program in place for the laptops to be held in the SAR area. Due to other\ndemands on her time involving SAP X, she relied on the ISSM to deal with the issue.\nApplicant highlighted another risk to her program inasmuch as company employees not\nbriefed to SAP X were used to courier program material and to retrieve mail from the\nSAP X sterile post office box. As of July 2005, the company was conducting an internal\ninquiry into that issue and relocating the post office box to prevent the possibility of\nfuture compromise. The available records contain no indication as to who directed\npersonnel, who had not been briefed, to courier or retrieve SAP material. (Ex. 9.c.)\nOn March 28, 2005, the CSSO indicated that shortly after he was hired in\nOctober 2004, he focused on identifying, compiling, and organizing the records for the\nSCIF, and that in November 2005, he had requested Applicant\u2019s assistance in\nidentifying SAP X materials in the vault for destruction. Applicant responded that she\nwas working on an inspection corrective action plan for her area following the marginal\nfacility rating in October 2004, and would defer the issue to security manager A. As\nreflected in an email response of November 12, 2004, Applicant informed the CSSO\nthat it would be okay to move the material around in the vault and she proposed a date\nof February 1, 2005, after the re-inspection, to start destruction. The CSSO responded\nthat he could work with that timetable, but untimely destruction was a security problem\nthat he planned to address as part of his area\u2019s overall self-inspection. The SAP X\nmaterial remained in the vault until after the January 2005 re-inspection, when Applicant\nwas replaced as CPSO for SAP X. The CSSO raised the issue with the new CPSO, and\nthe material pending destruction was removed. (Ex. 9.c.)\nDuring the company\u2019s inquiry, a security associate in the SAPSO expressed\nconcerns about minimal security training. Although she characterized Applicant as \u201cvery\nknowledgeable\u201d about security issues, she corroborated Applicant\u2019s assessment that\nsecurity was forced to do more with less, even to bend the rules to ensure that program\ndemands were met with the limited resources available. The security associate admitted\nthat she and Applicant were aware that TS materials had not been brought into\naccountability in a timely manner due to personnel shortages. This security associate\nrecalled all materials were brought into accountability and destroyed as necessary.\nHowever, when presented with some destruction documents from the 2004 time frame,\nthe employee could not identify those documents in the accountability system\u2019s records,\nwhich led the investigators to believe that TS material had been destroyed without first\nbeing brought into accountability. Another employee, who had provided administrative\nsupport for the SAP X from October 2003 to August 2004, recalled that a significant\namount of TS material was destroyed during an atmosphere that she described as\nchaotic. (Ex. 9.c.)\n\n11\nNo information was obtained during the investigation that would suggest SAP X\ninformation was released outside approved program areas of the CSSO\u2019s vault.\nHowever, the area staff could have been inadvertently exposed to SAP X information,\nso they executed inadvertent disclosure statements. The company reinforced the\nrequirement to timely report suspected deficiencies to proper government cognizant\nauthority. The investigator concluded that security manager A and Applicant were\nnegligent in that they were aware of, but failed to report, the existence of \u201chundreds of\npieces\u201d of accountable material to the government and bring it into full accountability.\nThe investigator also concluded that both security manager A and Applicant\n\u201cpurposefully\u201d hid SAP X material pending destruction in the CSSO\u2019s vault during the\nJanuary 2005 timeframe to avoid detection by the government security review team,\nand that both Applicant and security manager A admitted to it. Furthermore, Applicant\nand a security associate made incorrect statements about materials being brought into\nfull accountability before destruction. Applicant, security manager A, and the security\nassociate who dealt with the destruction were felt to have been deceptive during the\ninquiry to protect their jobs. (Ex. 9.c.)\nOn June 2, 2005, the MSAPSO recommended to military adjudication personnel\nthat Applicant\u2019s and security manager A\u2019s access to SAP be revoked for negligence in\ntheir handling and lack of control over SAP material, for knowingly putting material at\nrisk of compromise by placing SAP material in an area where non-accessed employees\nhad control of the items, for attempting to hide unaccounted items from a MSAPSO\nsecurity review team, and for failing to exercise appropriate management oversight over\nday-to-day security processes at the company. (Ex. 8.) Applicant, who had continued to\nwork for the company in security in an unclassified area following the suspension of her\nspecial access, started working as a configuration management specialist at a different\nfacility within the company in June 2005. (Ex. 2, Tr. 149-50.)\nEven after her SAP access had been suspended, Applicant still had the support\nof a security manager, and of managers of other government programs for whom\nApplicant had provided special security needs. She was knowledgeable about security\nissues and honest with them in her intent and actions. A program manager for a\nnational intelligence mission found her to be \u201cdependable, reliable, hard-working and\nconscientious.\u201d In his opinion, Applicant acted consistent with the sensitive nature of the\nprogram and recognized the need for \u201cperfect OPSEC practices.\u201d In June 2005, another\nprogram manager, who had a close working relationship, described Applicant as \u201can\noutstanding manager, with superior knowledge of special security.\u201d Yet another program\nmanager at the company considered her removal from her security duties to be a loss\nfor himself and other government contract programs at the company. (Ex. 2.)\nApplicant\u2019s employer notified the Defense Security Service of the results of its\nadministrative inquiry on July 7, 2005. (Ex. 9.c.) On March 9, 2006, Applicant was\ninterviewed by a government investigator about the security problems when she was\nCPSO. Applicant maintained that she was issued only two minor violations in the\nOctober 2004 inspection, but the information technology at the facility was rated as\nunsatisfactory. Applicant had complained to the special security officer that she had only\ntwo employees with whom to run 20 programs and was unable to keep up with\n\nApplicant indicated  in January 2008 that she had speculated as to the motives of the former ISSM.\n12\n(Ex. 2.) She testified at her October 2009 hearing that the ISSM and the MSAPSO investigator had worked\ntogether in the past at the local military base and were \u201cvery close friends.\u201d (Tr. 93-94)\n12\nregulations because she was understaffed. After she found a pile of unlabeled disks in\nher area, she notified the MSAPSO of her complaints. As for SAP X material being in\nthe vault in January 2005, Applicant responded that the material should not have been\nthere. She opined that the ISSM had disclosed the company\u2019s security problems to his\nneighbor, who had been involved in the MSAPSO inspections, to get back at the\ncompany that had denied him a promotion and to shift the blame from himself to her.12\nApplicant expressed her belief that the military acted to protect itself because of its own\nlack of cognizance. She asserted she was made a \u201cscape goat\u201d for the mistakes of\nothers, and denied any responsibility for the security violations. \nIn a January 12, 2008 statement to DOHA, Applicant indicated that the ISSM, not\nshe, had administrative rights to the LAN. Personnel were given accounts on the LAN\nthat should not have had the access, but were \u201cstrong armed\u201d by her former supervisor,\nsecurity manager A. She reminded DOHA that she had notified the cognizant MSAPSO\nthat the company was not complying with the requirements to control and store\ninformation classified TS/SCI/SAR. Applicant indicated that supervisors were put in the\ncompromising position of having to clean up programs that she had not been cleared\non. (Ex. 2.)\nApplicant has been dependable in meeting deadlines and in adhering to\ncompany procedures in her current position. (Ex. 2.) In her performance review\nfollowing her first full year in configuration management, Applicant was assessed as\nhaving achieved all her job objectives, with her only weakness being a lack of\nexperience in the field. (Ex. C.) In 2007, she exceeded job expectations in several areas\n(implementing programs, process, meeting utilization targets). She brought order to a\ndysfunctional program and did an excellent job ensuring timely release of hardware and\nsoftware documentation and internal data. (Ex. D.) Again, in 2008, she exceeded some\nobjectives, with significant cost savings to a program. (Ex. E.)  A coworker familiar with\nher performance as a security manager and in her present position in configuration/data\nmanagement considers her to be dedicated and professional in carrying out her duties.\n(Ex. 2.)\nApplicant\u2019s TS security clearance has  been suspended because of the security\nviolations in 2004/05. She requires a secret-level security clearance for her present\nduties. (Tr. 165-67.)  Applicant denies that she deliberately hid SAP X material in the\nvault. The vault was on the inspection list for reinspection and it had been cleared to\nstore SAP X material. (Tr. 104) She also cannot understand why the ISSM was not\ndisciplined because of the unauthorized use of the LAN. (Tr. 101-02)\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\n\n13\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nHandling Protected Information\nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in Guideline K,\nAG \u00b6 33:\n\n14\nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability\nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\nThe Government alleged in SOR 1.a that Applicant was found responsible for\ntwo security violations as a result of an inspection conducted of a SCIF at her place of\nemployment. Applicant denies being cited for any security violations as a result of that\ninspection. To the contrary, she contends that SAPs under her security cognizance had\nonly two minor findings that had to be corrected before the re-inspection. The inspection\nreport was not made available for review, and the nature of the alleged security\nviolations is unclear. The Government submitted in closing argument that the violations\nconcerned the LAN and the vault. But the evidence shows that the only issue known\nabout the LAN at that time was that the co-utilization agreement finalized in October\n2004 had to be revised to include a fifth signatory. The ISSM was working with the\nMSAPSO to correct the issue. As for the vault, problems with accountability known to\nthe MSAPSO had been addressed during the summer of 2004. The issue with SAP X\nTS/SAR reel-to-reel tapes and other SAP X material remaining in the SCIF did not\nsurface until late January 2005. The evidence instead shows that the laptops were\nfound in SAP X\u2019s area during the government inspection in October 2004. But Applicant\ndenies previous knowledge of classified laptops in her area, and they remained secured\npending the ISSM acting on her direction to obtain approvals. There is no evidence that\nshe was personally cited for a security violation relating to the laptop issue. To the\ncontrary, individual responsibility could not be determined following her employer\u2019s\ninvestigation. In short, the evidence fails to establish SOR 1.a.\nAs for the security issues involving the vault and LAN, which are covered in SOR\n1.d, the evidence establishes that while Applicant was the CPSO for SAP X and TS\ncontrol officer, she mishandled classified SAP material in failing to ensure that TS/SAR\nmaterial was brought into proper accountability before the summer of 2004. While\nApplicant is credited with pushing for the removal of SAP X classified material from the\nSCIF into the SAP X area by spring of 2003, and for informing the MSAPSO in April\n2004 that a large volume of classified material remained outside of accountability, she\nand security manager A were culpable for violating security regulations in that they\nknowingly permitted hundreds, if not thousands, of classified items to remain outside of\naccountability until the summer of 2004. Under \u00b6 5-201 of the NISPOM, the TS control\nofficer is required to maintain accountability records for TS information. AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany\nfailure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information,\u201d\nclearly applies.\nAlso, Applicant was asked by the CSSO in November 2004 to remove classified\nmaterial pertaining to SAP X from the SCIF. Because she was focused on the upcoming\ngovernment reinspection, she told the CSSO that she would defer the matter to security\nmanager A since the inspection corrective action plan took priority. In response to his\nrequest for a timetable, Applicant suggested February 1, 2005, after the reinspection,\nand the CSSO did not object. As a result, material remained in the vault until after she\nwas replaced as CPSO. Applicant\u2019s employer concluded after its investigation (and the\n\nApplicant testified about the materials found in the vault in the fall of 2004, as follows:\n13\nI was given 30 days to bring thousands of pieces of classified into accountability. The\nproblem with a lot of this was we didn\u2019t have containers to put it in, it was thrown in the vault.\nW hen I say things were thrown in the vault, they were thrown in the vault. They were not in\ncontainers. I don\u2019t know if you are familiar with Ampex tapes. Ampex tapes are reel to reel\ntest tapes. They are about that big, they have a small reel in the middle and the rest is all\ntape, it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s tapes that you would take out in the field during testing. There are\nhundreds of these. These do not fit in containers. They were TS/SAR/SI, that was the stamp\non them. W hat we did was we had an approved shredder in the back, we had a very\ncognizant [SAP X] engineer come down and say you can keep that, you\u2019ve got to get rid of\nthis, you can keep that, you know, things we needed to keep for historical data. W e destroyed\nmultiple of these tapes. They are all on certificates of destruction with two people signing off\non the tape. During that time, the shredder broke. W e advised the government that the\nshredder had broke [sic] and we couldn\u2019t get, there was no other way to destroy this material.\nThe way you destroy it is you actually take a ceiling like this and you pull the tape and you\nend up with a pile of tape. You usually have to cut it to fit it into garbage bags, so it would fit\ninto garbage bags. This is the material that they have that I didn\u2019t show to the United States\ngovernment because we had two garbage bags full of shredded Ampex tapes that we\ncouldn\u2019t shred because the shredder wasn\u2019t working at the time. This was what was found\nin the vault, to my knowledge . . . .\u201d (Tr. 107-08.)\n15\nMSAPSO concurred) that Applicant had willfully withheld classified materials from CSA\ninspection and/or oversight:\nFurther, information was obtained during this investigation indicates some\n[SAP X] material pending destruction was purposefully hidden within the\nCSSO\u2019s vault during the January 2005 timeframe to avoid being detected\nby the USG Security Review Team. Both [security manager A] and\n[Applicant] admitted to this, thus exposing non-program-briefed individuals\nto [SAP X] information. (Ex. 9.c.)\nThe records available for review show that Applicant knew that SAP X material, which\nwas classified up to TS/SAR, was kept in the CSSO\u2019s vault pending destruction as of\nJanuary 2005.  But she denies willful concealment from the CSA. Applicant\u2019s\n13\nuncorroborated testimony is that the vault was included on the inspection list. (Tr. 152-\n54.) The fact that the CSSO brought the unapproved storage to the attention of the new\nCPSO for SAP X would indicate that the classified material was not discovered during\nthe reinspection.  It is possible that the material could have gone undetected. It would\nnot appear that material was moved into the vault solely to conceal it from the upcoming\ninspection. Materials were apparently in the SCIF because of their size or lack of space\nto accommodate all items for destruction. That having been said, Applicant knew about\nthe upcoming reinspection, and that persons with access to the CSSO\u2019s SCIF had not\nbeen briefed to SAP X. By leaving the SAP X material classified up to the level of\nTS/SAR in the vault, including in green bags on a cart, she risked being found in\nviolation of accountability and destruction requirements in the upcoming inspection,\npresuming the inspectors had access to the vault. More important, she knew or should\nhave known that she placed SAP X classified material at risk of compromise by non-\naccessed employees while it was in the vault. Not all persons with access to the vault\n\n16\nhad been briefed on SAP X. While the CSSO had primary responsibility to ensure that\nthe material was properly protected once he found it in the vault in the fall of 2004,\nApplicant violated her obligation to protect classified material within her security\ncognizance. See NISPOM \u00b6 1-200 (stating, \u201ccontractors shall protect all classified\ninformation to which they have access or custody\u201d). AG \u00b6 34(a), \u201cdeliberate or negligent\ndisclosure of classified or other protected information to unauthorized persons, including\nbut not limited to personal or business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at\nseminars, meetings, or conferences,\u201d applies to the extent that disclosure because of\nApplicant\u2019s negligence cannot be ruled out. There is no evidence proving access,\ndeliberate or inadvertent, by an individual non-accessed to SAP X. AG \u00b6 34(b),\n\u201ccollecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or in any other\nunauthorized location,\u201d and AG \u00b6 34(g) clearly apply.\nThe company\u2019s investigator found Applicant deceptive in that she had assured\nthe MSAPSO in the summer of 2004 that all materials had been brought into full\naccountability, when \u201cnew program material\u201d ranging in classification from unclassified\nto TS had been found within the CSSO\u2019s vault in January 2005. An employee who\nprovided administrative support to the SAPSO from October 2003 to August 2004\nexpressed her belief that the destruction was only 1/3 complete when she left the office.\nIt is unclear whether the \u201cnew\u201d information is from this time frame. During the inquiry, it\nwas discovered that several pieces of accountable material had been destroyed without\nfirst being brought into accountability, but the information does not show that Applicant\nknew that her security associates had failed to log those particular items. As a result of\nthe company\u2019s investigation over the March to June 2005 time frame, two items were\nplaced into TS accountability; the rest were determined to be non-accountable. Given\nthat hundreds or even thousands of documents had to be logged into accountability\nduring the summer of 2004, I cannot conclude based on the evidence that Applicant lied\nwhen she told the MSAPSO that all items had been brought into accountability.\nConcerning the LAN within the SAP X area, the co-utilization agreement in place\nas of October 2004 specified that only customer #2 data would be maintained on the\nLAN dedicated systems. During an effort by the ISSM to get the LAN approved for\nsecurity administrative functions to support multiple SAPs, the LAN was discovered to\nbe operating in violation of its protection level 1 accreditation and the established co-\nutilization agreement. Multiple SAP CSA data was commingled on the AIS. No SAP\ntechnical data associated with any of the company\u2019s customers was identified on the\nLAN, but the LAN data included classified combinations up to the TS/SAR level and\nclassified associations in receipt and dispatch data bases. Applicant had told the ISSM\nthat the system contained only unclassified security administrative data. Whether or not\nshe knew that classified data was on the system, she was negligent in failing to ensure\nthat the LAN was in compliance with its existing protection level and co-utilization\nagreement. Deficiency in her AIS knowledge in comparison to the ISSM, and the fact\nthat she did not have administrative rights to the LAN, do not excuse her failure to\ncomply with her oversight responsibilities in all areas of security under her cognizance.\nAG \u00b6 34(c), \u201cloading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise\nhandling classified reports, data or other information on any unapproved equipment\nincluding but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or computer hardware,\n\n17\nsoftware, drive, system, game board, handheld, \u2018palm\u2019 or pocket device or other adjunct\nequipment,\u201d applies in that her negligence led to material up to TS/SAR being loaded\nonto the office LAN, in violation of the protection level for the system. Furthermore, her\nfailure to exercise her security responsibilities over the LAN and its contents falls within\nAG \u00b6 34(g).\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, five years have passed since\nApplicant\u2019s violations of security procedures. While she satisfies the first component of\nAG \u00b6 35(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior,\u201d it is difficult to mitigate the\nGuideline K concerns solely on the basis of the passage of time. She has handled\ninformation in her new position in data/configuration management appropriately, but\nwith her TS clearance suspended, there is no track record of subsequent compliance\nwith the rules and regulations concerning classified information that would lead one to\nconclude that the violations are not likely to recur. AG \u00b6 35(a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not adequately mitigate the\nserious security concerns.\nAG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial\nsecurity training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of\nsecurity responsibilities,\u201d does not apply in the absence of any effort by Applicant to\nobtain security training or to accept responsibility for her own lack of security oversight.\nWhether or not the ISSM should have been disciplined or held partially responsible for\nthe LAN violation, Applicant would have gone a long way toward showing reform had\nshe at a minimum acknowledged the role she played in the LAN violation. She provided\ninaccurate and conflicting information to the ISSM about the level of classified\ninformation on the LAN. Furthermore, she disputes that she knowingly put material at\nrisk of compromise by placing SAP material in an area controlled by non-accessed\nemployees. (Tr. 151) Given she did not have access to the vault, she likely did not put\nthe classified SAP material in the vault herself. But certainly by the fall of 2004, if not\nbefore, she knew it was there. She testified that she had documentation from probably\nthe early 1990s indicating that the vault was approved for the storage of SAP X SAR\nmaterial. (Tr. 104) Assuming the authorization was still valid, the method in which the\nTS/SAR tapes were stored (garbage bags) left the material vulnerable to unauthorized\naccess. Moreover, there is no evidence that she brought the storage problems to the\nattention of the MSAPSO in the fall of 2004.\nApplicant\u2019s argument for mitigation under AG \u00b6 35(c), \u201cthe security violations\nwere due to improper or inadequate training,\u201d is not particularly persuasive. While she\ndid not have had any formal training when she was started in the SAPSO at the\ncompany, she had enough on-the-job training by 2002 for the government to approve\nher as CPSO for SAP X. Her lack of expertise in the AIS explains to some extent her\nreliance on the ISSM in seeking the necessary approvals for the LAN upgrade, but it\ndoes not justify her failure to provide accurate information to the ISSM about the level of\nclassification on the LAN and whether it included program data from multiple customers.\nApplicant testified at her hearing that she knew the NISPOM \u201cbackwards and forwards.\u201d\n\n18\nSeveral program managers, for whom Applicant provided security before her access\nwas suspended in January 2005, found her to be very knowledgeable in special security\nmatters.\nApplicant\u2019s violations are extenuated in part. Applicant had security\nresponsibilities for about 20 SAPs when the workload on SAP X was increasing. Her\nrequests for adequate staffing were only minimally supported. The ISSM was hired for\nSAP X in May 2003, but he had duties during the fall of 2004 that took him away from\nmaintaining the LANs in Applicant\u2019s area. During the summer of 2004, there were only a\nfew security associates in the office to bring hundreds if not thousands of documents\ninto accountability. There were systemic problems in security within the facility at the\ntime, as evidenced by its apparent marginal inspection rating in October 2004. But\nhowever difficult the working environment, Applicant had an obligation to her\ngovernment customer to protect the sensitive information within her security\ncognizance. Her burden of reform is not fully met where she accepts little responsibility\nfor her own violations. Work demands do not justify the delay in reviewing the contents\nof SAP X material removed from the vault, or the improper storage of TS/SAR materials\nin a SCIF where persons not briefed on the program could gain unauthorized access.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nBased on their respective security inquiries into the security violations that led to\nthe suspension of Applicant\u2019s access to SAP, the MSAPSO and Applicant\u2019s employer\nconcluded that Applicant willfully withheld classified materials from CSA inspection or\noversight or both. (Ex. 7, 8, 9.c.) Presumably, both are referring to the knowing storage\nof the TS/SAR material in the vault over the fall of 2004 until after the reinspection. Such\nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior would raise serious personal conduct concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 16(d):\nCredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination,\nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited\nto consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include\nbreach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sens\n\n19\nApplicant has consistently denied any intent to hide the SAP X classified material\nin the vault. As discussed supra, Applicant did not remove the material from the vault\nover the fall of 2004. While the company investigator indicated that both security\nmanager A and Applicant admitted that SAP X material pending destruction was hidden\nin the CSSO vault to avoid detection, the investigator\u2019s summaries of the respective\ninterviews did not contain the alleged admissions. Written statements were provided by\nboth security manager A and Applicant, which were attached to the investigator\u2019s report.\nNeither statement contains an admission of knowing concealment of material from\ninspectors. Applicant has not denied that some material remained in the vault. The\nevidence before me for review falls short of proving wilful concealment. AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe\ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d applies as\nto SOR 2.a.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s TS clearance and her access to SAPs were suspended because of\nher involvement in the mishandling of classified TS/SAP materials while TS control\nofficer and CPSO for SAP X.  She placed TS/SAR material at risk by leaving it in a vault\naccessed by individuals who had not been briefed on the program(s). She neglected her\nresponsibilities to timely place into accountability and destroy where appropriate\nsensitive information involving SAP X that had been brought out of the SCIF into her\narea. As for the LAN, she told a government investigator that she assumed the LAN\nwas approved to the S/SAR level, and she relied on the ISSM to obtain the approvals\nfor the new hardware. While there was old information on the LAN, database files were\nidentified that supported current customers beyond customer #2, including receipt and\ndispatch records and SAP door and container combinations. TS accountability records\nwere on the system pertaining to customer #2. She has not fully addressed the\ndiscrepancy between her reported understanding of what was on the system and what\nwas found. The overall security posture at the facility was a contributing factor in that\n\nSOR 1.b is found for Applicant in that it references solely an administrative action taken by her\n14\nemployer and does not allege any specific violation.\nThere is no evidence of a final decision on her special programs access. Furthermore, SOR 1.e does\n15\nnot allege any violation committed by Applicant.\n20\nsecurity took a backseat to other program demands, and Applicant had a demanding, if\nnot overwhelming, workload. But Applicant had enough experience in security to\nunderstand that she should not bend the rules by storing classified material in an\nunapproved location and risk compromise. Despite the passage of time since the\nviolations, and some very favorable references, I am unable to conclude based on the\nrecord before me that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or restore\naccess to classified information for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant14\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant15\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP), on\nFebruary 28, 2007. On June 30 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 21, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. This Administrative Judge was assigned the\nmatter on August 27, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 12, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing on October 7, 2008.  The Government offered five exhibits,\n\n2\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, without\nobjection and testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on October 16, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 53 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Business\nManagement.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a General Maintenance\nPerson, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant was arrested on or about August 16, 2006, and was charged with\n(1) Battery and (2) Criminal Threats.  The Applicant explained that he learned from his\nexcessive telephone bills that his wife had been text messaging a man who lived out of\nstate.  One evening while she was filing some papers or arranging something on the\nfloor, he asked her about it.  She refused to answer so he bent down and grabbed her\nearlobe between his thumb and forefinger.  She screamed and he let go.  Law\nenforcement arrived and the Applicant was arrested.  He was held in jail for 12 hours\nand was served with a Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting him from going near his\nwife.  Applicant stayed at a friends house.  The charges were ultimately rejected by the\nDistrict Attorney.  The Applicant believes that his wife dropped the charges.    \nShortly after this incident, the Applicant learned that his wife had taken\n$15,000.00 out of their home equity line of credit without telling him.  (Tr. p. 40).  She\ntold him that she loaned $9,000.00 to a friend to buy a car and she spent the other\n$6,000.00 on miscellaneous items.  The Applicant\u2019s wife was not employed outside of\nthe home.  He tried to encourage her to look for work because he was feeling the\nfinancial strain of working seven days a week with no social life to support the family\nand his wife\u2019s lifestyle, but she did not want to work.  He stated that she pretended to\nlook for work but never found anything suitable.  (Tr. p. 58).  She wanted only certain\npositions that paid a certain amount and nothing less.  (Tr. p. 59).     \nOn or about April 28, 2007, the Applicant was arrested again, this time he was\ncharged with (1) Assault with a Deadly Weapon/Instrument, and (2) Exhibit Deadly\nWeapon other than Firearm.  (Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant explained that he\nhad returned from a trip to visit his sister whose family was more functional.  He arrived\nat his home and became very depressed.  He saw that the house and the yard were a\ncomplete mess, the pool was dirty, there was dog mess in the yard, the house was\ncluttered with trash.  He became so frustrated that he had a melt down.  Anything that\nwas his had to be placed in the garage, so he went to get his things out and brought\n\n3\nthem into the house.  He started yelling profanities and admits that he may have said\nthat he was going to kill them.  He also admits going to the kitchen, picking up two\nknives and making a slashing motion across his throat with them.  He was found guilty\nof Count (1), and was sentenced to 48 months in jail, with all except two days\nsuspended, (with the remainder of his term to be served on probation), to perform 20\ndays of community service, pay fines/fee of approximately $530.00, and was ordered to\nstay away from the victim, and to complete a 52 week Domestic Violence Counseling\nProgram.  Count 2 was dismissed.  Presently, the Applicant has completed the\ncommunity service requirement and paid the fine imposed by the court.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E).  He has completed 31 of the 52 weeks of the Domestic Violence counseling\nprogram and his probationary period will be complete in 2012.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nThe Applicant states that his attorney who represented him in April 2007\nindicated that through his investigation, he has learned that the Applicant\u2019s wife was\nsending resumes to Massachusetts in 2007 looking for employment.  (Tr. p. 62).\nThe Applicant subsequently filed for divorce from his wife.  (Tr. p. 51).  He is\nscheduled to pay child and spousal support in the amount of $480.00 per week.  (Tr. p.\n55).  He has not seen his daughter for a year and a half because she does not want to\nsee him.  (Tr. pp. 56-57).\nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Plant Senior Manager indicates\nthat the Applicant\u2019s work ethic, output and work product is excellent.  He has worked\nhard to consistently improve himself, and he is considered to be a valuable asset to the\ncompany.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nExcerpts from the Applicant\u2019s military records indicate that he was an asset to the\nUnited States Navy.  Among other commendations, he received the Humanitarian\nService Medal with one bronze star and was honorable discharged.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits C and D).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\n\n5\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J). The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with him security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline J of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant was arrested in August 2006, for Battery\nand Criminal Threats, and in April 2007, for Assault with a Deadly Weapon other than a\nFirearm.  Both arrests are recent, as they occurred within the last two years.  Sufficient\nrehabilitation has not been shown.  Under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying\nConditions, 31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted apply.  None of the Mitigation Conditions are\napplicable.  The Applicant is still in the process of completing the sentencing\n\n6\nrequirements imposed by the court as a result of his most recent conviction.  He will\nremain on probation until 2012.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  It is noted that the Applicant has worked\nfor the same defense contractor for over 17 years, and he has never received a security\nviolation.  However, he allowed himself to stay in an abusive relationship that ultimately\ncaused him to become explosive, and he did some things that he should not have.\nWhatever the case, his criminal conduct is not justified.  Under the particular facts of this\ncase, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole,\nsupport a whole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\na lack of candor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and he does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the  Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\n",

He denied that the allegations reflected reduced judgment, reliability or trustworthiness on his part. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 6), are incorporated in the following findings.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in June 2000. In\nOctober 2006, he was arrested and charged with DUI, and with his subsequent refusal\nto take a breath test. He pled guilty to the latter charge, and the DUI charge was\ndismissed. He remains on probation for this offense, and continues to drink. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 4,\n2006. On April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines G, and J\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nNovember 20, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 5, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing (Answer) on May 23, and June 23, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. DOHA received the latter response on June 26, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 22, 2008, and the case was\nassigned to me on July 24, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 1, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 29, 2008. The Government\noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, and submitted exhibits (AE) A through C, which were\nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until\nNovember 12, 2008 to permit submission of additional evidence. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 6, 2008. On that same date, Applicant\nsubmitted five additional documents via Department Counsel, and requested additional\ntime to obtain a signed letter from his immediate supervisor. This request was granted,\nand he submitted the letter via Department Counsel on November 13, 2008. These\nadditional documents were marked AE D, admitted without objection, and the record\nwas closed.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and (by reference) 2.a. He denied that the allegations reflected\nreduced judgment, reliability or trustworthiness on his part. Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nincluding those contained in his response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 6), are\nincorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He retired from the\nAir Force in April 2000, after 20 years and 3 months of enlisted service. He is rated 50%\ndisabled for injuries suffered in a bombing incident while serving overseas, and is active\nin the VFW. He held a security clearance for more than 28 years.\nOn May 21, 2000, Applicant was riding with his former wife in their car. She was\ndriving because he had been drinking that evening. They had an argument during which\nhe accused her of infidelity. She stopped the car in the middle of a major intersection,\ngot out and walked away. To avoid blocking the intersection, Applicant slid over into the\ndriver\u2019s seat and drove the car through the intersection and into a bank parking lot. A\npoliceman who saw this take place approached and asked Applicant if he had been\ndrinking. Applicant admitted that he had, and was then arrested for DUI. He failed a\nbreathalyzer test at the police station. In April 2007, he told an investigator he could not\nrecall his blood alcohol content (BAC), but he was \u201cjust over the limit.\u201d (Tr. at 43-47; GE\n3 at 1; GE 6 at 5.) Court records indicate that he tested with a BAC of .161, however.\nHe was sentenced, after pleading \u201cno contest,\u201d to pay a fine and costs, to serve 3 days\nin jail with an additional 42 days suspended, to complete an alcohol safety program and\nserve 2 years probation. (GE 1 at 5.) He completed all sentence requirements\nsatisfactorily.\n\n3\nOn October 21, 2006, Applicant was driving home after 10 p.m. from a VFW post\nwhere his friend was the bartender. Applicant said he consumed two beers between\nabout 7 and 8:30 p.m., then stopped drinking. A policeman stopped him because he did\nnot have his lights on. The officer noticed a faint smell of alcohol and asked Applicant to\nperform a field sobriety test. He told the officer he could not do so because of the\ninjuries to his leg. He was arrested and taken to the police station, where he refused to\ntake the breathayzer test because he could not contact his attorney. He remained in\ncustody until October 23, 2006, when he posted $1,000 cash bail. He was charged with\nboth DUI and refusing to submit to a chemical test. On January 10, 2007, pursuant to a\npretrial agreement, he pled guilty to the test refusal charge and the prosecutor\ndismissed the DUI charge. He was sentenced to pay a $7,000 fine with $3,000\nsuspended, 180 days in jail with 150 days suspended, a year\u2019s suspension of his\ndriver\u2019s license, 80 hours of community service and 5 years probation. He was also\nordered to attend the alcohol safety program again. He completed that course, but still\nowes $3,000 of the fine and will remain on probation until January 2012. (Tr. at 40-42,\n73; GE 5; GE 6 at 3-4.)\nAlthough not listed on the SOR as a potentially disqualifying allegation, Applicant\nwas also arrested and convicted for a DUI in 1988 while serving in the Air Force. He\nand a group of friends went out drinking and he thought he was better off than his\nfriends, so he drove home. He stated that he learned not to drink and drive from that\nincident. (Tr. at 81-84.) However, he continues to drink alcohol. (Tr. at 95.)\nApplicant submitted character reference letters from three colleagues and\nsupervisors. These letters attest to his outstanding character and integrity, and his\nsuperior performance at work. (AE A: AE B; AE D at 3-4, 8-9.) On June 6, 2007, he was\nevaluated by the VA and found not to meet the criterial for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse\nor dependence. (AE C.) He completed Alcohol and Drug Information School, a 12-hour\ncourse, on February 1-3, 2008. (AE D at 11.) His military awards and decorations\ninclude the Purple Heart, the Air Force Commendation Medal with two devices, the Air\nForce Achievement Medal with one device, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal with four\ndevices, and numerous service and unit awards. (AE D at 12.) He holds a leadership in\nhis VFW Post, and has worked to supply telephone calling cards to deployed troops.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n\n4\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition asserted by the Government in\nthis case is: \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d\n\n5\nApplicant was arrested twice for DUI since leaving active duty in 2000. The first\ntime he engaged in an argument with his former wife while she was driving him home,\nand provoked her to the point that she stopped the car in a busy intersection and\nwalked away. He then chose to drive the car, and was arrested and convicted. His\nOctober 2006 DUI arrest resulted from his driving at night with his lights off after an\nevening at the VFW Post bar. He refused to participate in chemical testing for alcohol\nlevels, despite claiming he had only consumed two beers some two hours before his\narrest. He was held in jail until he posted a $1,000 cash bond more than a day later. He\nreceived a relatively severe sentence, although not convicted of DUI as a result of his\nplea agreement. The Government has established substantial evidence raising security\nconcerns under this guideline, shifting the burden of proof to Applicant to mitigate those\nconcerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s most recent DUI arrest was only two years ago, and is one of three\nsuch arrests since 1988. The conduct of concern is recent and, with three such\nincidents in 20 years, can not be considered infrequent. Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated\nversion of his DUI arrests would suggest unusual circumstances, but his admitted\nresponse to each set of circumstances reflected bad judgment that continues to cast\ndoubt on his current trustworthiness. He provoked his wife to leave the car in his\nintoxicated state, then drove the car himself. He refused chemical testing that would\nhave confirmed his lack of intoxication had that been the case. Applicant established no\n\n6\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 23(a).  He neither asserted nor provided evidence to support\nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 (b), (c), or (d). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government were:\n\u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d \u201c(c) allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted;\u201d and \u201c(d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nApplicant was arrested and convicted for DUI in 2000, with a BAC of .161. He\nwas again arrested for DUI in 2006, but refused alcohol-level testing and was convicted\nof that offense in lieu of the DUI charge. He gave no rational explanation for refusing the\nchemical test of his blood alcohol level that would be consistent with innocence of the\nDUI. He will remain on probation until January 2012 for this offense, with a suspended 5\nmonth jail sentence and additional $3,000 fine pending his continued good behavior.\nThe Government has presented substantial evidence raising security concerns under\nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 32 (a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d It is just two years since his most recent\nDUI arrest, driving home from an evening spent at the VFW post bar - an activity he\ncontinues to be involved with. He refused chemical testing to determine his BAC on that\noccasion. That casts doubt on his good judgment if he was sober, and casts doubt on\nhis trustworthiness if he was not. \nThe only other potentially applicable mitigating condition in this case is AG \u00b6 32\n(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d Two years have passed since his last DUI arrest, but he has been on\nprobation with substantial suspended punishment hanging over his head during this\nperiod. His employment record has been good, but on balance that is not yet sufficient\nto mitigate security concerns arising from a 20-year history of multiple DUI incidents\nleading to arrests and convictions.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involved two post-service DUI arrests, leading to convictions and substantial\nsentences including probation that will continue until 2012.  He was evaluated and not\ndiagnosed with alcohol abuse or dependence, but each of these incidents demonstrated\npoor judgment and disregard for his obligations under pertinent laws and regulations.\nApplicant claimed that his admitted 1988 DUI offense taught him not to repeat\nsuch criminal conduct, but his 2000 and 2006 incidents belie his assertion that he\nlearned to be more responsible. None of this conduct was involuntary or otherwise\ncoerced. He continues to drink under conditions similar to those that led to these\nincidents, and his minimization of responsibility for his conduct precludes any judgment\nthat continuation or recurrence is unlikely. \nApplicant\u2019s good reputation among work colleagues is commendable, and if he\ncan avoid future crimes and alcohol-related incidents that performance will support\nfuture consideration for security clearance eligibility. To date, however, he has not met\nhis burden of mitigating security concerns raised by his behavior and judgment as\nalleged in the SOR.\nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption\nand criminal conduct. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn January 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 19, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on May 12, 2009, and the hearing was convened as \nJune 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nscheduled on June 1, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which \nwere received without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter was marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two witnesses, and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 9, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer or a predecessor company since 1990. He has held a security \nclearance at the Secret or Top Secret level since 1985. He has a master\u2019s degree. He \nhas been married since 1980. He has two adult children.1  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of incidents of indecent exposure and public \nmasturbation. He was charged as a juvenile in 1968, when he was 14 years old, with \nindecent exposure. He was masturbating in his front yard and was observed by his adult \nneighbor. He was placed on probation for two years for the offense. He admitted that his \nincidents of indecent exposure and public masturbation occurred about once or twice \nevery two weeks from about 1968 through 1978. He received psychological treatment \nfrom about 1968 to 1970 for his issues.2  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 1978, and charged with exposing himself in a public \nplace. He was 24 years old at the time. He exposed his genitals and was masturbating \nin front of two girls who were about 14 years old. He was convicted of the reduced \ncharge of disturbing the peace and was placed on probation for at least one year. He \nagain received psychological treatment from about 1978 to 1980.3  \n \n \nApplicant continued his behavior of public masturbation approximately once a \nmonth from 1978 through September 2005. He often observed a female that he found \nattractive while he was driving or walking. If he was driving, he would find a parking lot \nor side street and masturbate. If he was not in the car, he would attempt to find a place \nsuch as public bathroom with a locked stall or a bathroom shower in the gym and \nmasturbate. He stated that the last time someone observed him masturbating was in the \nmid-1990s. He was in a car and saw a woman. He was masturbating while he drove \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 33-35, 44; GE 5. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 6, 9, 10. \n \n3 Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \npast her and she saw him. He stated that he stopped exposing himself out of fear of \nbeing arrested.4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Personnel Security Questionnaire on November 13, 1985. \nHe listed his two arrests and his psychological counseling. He also wrote, \u201cI have had \nno further problems and do not anticipate any more problems.\u201d5 He provided a signed \nwritten statement for his background investigation on January 30, 1986. He discussed \nhis arrests, psychological counseling and sexual behavior up through 1978, but he \nwrote: \n \nPartly because of my counseling and mostly because I became a \nChristian I gave up this behavior in 1978. It is no longer even something \nthat I have to guard against and I don\u2019t feel it is a security problem as my \nwife, my family and close friends are aware of my past behavior.6 \n \nApplicant testified that he had given up exhibitionism by that time, but was still \nmasturbating in public places. He later admitted that when he provided the statement, \nhe was still having problems with exhibitionism, and that it was a false statement.7 \n \n \nApplicant submitted another Personnel Security Questionnaire on January 7, \n1991. He again listed his two arrests and his psychological counseling. He provided \nanother signed written statement for his background investigation on March 27, 1991. \nHe discussed the omission of some old drug use from the questionnaire. He did not \nadmit that his incidents of public masturbation had continued. He wrote: \n \nWhen asked by the interviewer how I view myself in relation to honesty \nand ethical behavior, I described myself as an experienced man. I have \nlived through the mistakes of my youth and still have to explain them to \nothers. This has resulted in a great deal of self evaluation which has \nhelped me to make better decisions and live a more honest life.  I believe I \nam very honest and as I mentioned above I am not comfortable with \ndishonesty. . . . Again I ask you to forgive me for omitting the above drug \nuse and believe me when I say that I am being completely honest with \nyou. Thank you.8 \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 30-32, 37-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6, 9. \n \n5 Tr. at 30; GE 1. It was not alleged in the SOR that Applicant submitted false information and any \nfalse statements will not be used for disqualification purposes. His statements will be considered in \nassessing his credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n6 GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. at 31-32. \n8 GE 4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant had a polygraph and interview in October 2005, pursuant to a request \nthat he be granted access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). He admitted \nduring the interview that he had continued to masturbate in public places, with the last \nincident in September 2005. He stated that he did it because he was unable to control \nhis urges. He was denied access to SCI in February 2006.9 \n \n \nAfter he was denied access to SCI, Applicant sought counseling through his \nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP). He received counseling from a Licensed \nProfessional Counselor (LPC) from about March 2006 to August 2006 for his sexual \ncompulsion issues. He enrolled in a program at his church in which he was provided a \ntrained accountability partner. He met with or conversed weekly with his accountability \npartner for about six months. He began attending a 12-step program through his church \nin March 2006, and still regularly attends and leads the program. Applicant\u2019s LPC wrote \nthat \u201cin [his] professional judgment, [Applicant] did not have a condition or treatment that \nwould impair his judgment or reliability, particularly in the context of safeguarding \nclassified national security information.\u201d10 The director of the 12-step program wrote: \n \nIn my experience [Applicant] is well into recovery and plans to continue \nwith the program. Based on his actions and honesty, I do not judge him to \nbe an imminent threat to the national interest, nor a security risk due to his \nopen and honest behavior. Given the number of people that are aware of \nhis issue and the steps he has taken to change his behavior I do not \nbelieve that [he] would be subject to influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. I find [Applicant] to be reliable, trustworthy and a leader within our \nprogram.11  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he last masturbated in an inappropriate place a few \nweeks ago, when he masturbated in the locked bathroom on an airplane. He was at his \nson\u2019s college graduation and \u201cthere were a number of very attractive young women in \nvery slinky dresses, and one in particular caught [his] eye and stayed in [his] mind.\u201d12 \nHe stated that he attempts to avoid things and places that could act as a sexual \nstimulus such as: \n \nLooking at pornography, watching things on TV that would be stimulating, \ngoing places where you would know that there would be females that \nmight be undressed, like at a beach or swimming pool, where you could \nsee more flesh. So I avoid those situations. I don\u2019t go actively seek those \nout. So I don\u2019t take in as much stimulus, and I mean, you get a certain \namount just on a normal summer day, but I look away, I talk to people in \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 32-33; GE 6, 8, 9. The results of the polygraph are not considered for this decision except \ninsofar as the impact the polygraph had on Applicant providing details about his sexual incidents. \n10 Tr. at 26-27, 35-37, 41-44, 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C. \n \n11 AE B. \n \n12 Tr. at 37-41. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nmy accountability group about struggles. And that helps to debilitate it and \ntake it out of my mind.13 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is completely aware of his sexual issues and the steps he has \ntaken to address them. He has also told his children about his problem. A leader of \nApplicant\u2019s 12-step program testified on his behalf. He stated that Applicant is \ncommitted to the program. Applicant told him about the incident on the airplane. He \nbelieves that Applicant is trustworthy and that he would not be subject to coercion or \nduress because of his condition.14  \n \n \nApplicant noted that he takes national security very seriously and has no \npersonal security violations in his record. He stated that his issues could not be used as \na basis for duress or exploitation and that he would contact security officials if anyone \never attempted to do so.15  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 41. \n \n14 Tr. at 27-28, 45-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A. \n \n15 Tr. at 28. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which can \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s incidents of indecent exposure, exhibitionism, and masturbating in \npublic and/or inappropriate places establish all the above disqualifying conditions. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i allege Applicant\u2019s counseling and participation in the 12-step \nprogram. Those are matters in mitigation and do not raise a disqualifying condition. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i are concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate Sexual Behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \nSome of the incidents alleged occurred during Applicant\u2019s adolescence. \nHowever, they continued well into his adult years. AG \u00b6 14(a) is not applicable. It has \nbeen more than ten years since he exposed himself to a woman, but his incidents of \nmasturbating in inappropriate places has continued. Applicant may not have been \nobserved when he masturbated in a parked car, bathroom stall, gym shower, and the \nbathroom on an airplane, but they are not completely private places, and the behavior \ncannot be considered discreet. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(d) are not applicable. Applicant has \ninformed his wife, children and others about his sexual issues. That has lessened his \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. Because he continues to engage in \ninappropriate sexual actions, his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress also \ncontinues. AG \u00b6 14(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that Sexual Behavior security concerns are still present \ndespite the presence of some mitigation.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n8 \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct was also alleged under the Sexual Behavior \nguideline, as addressed above. That behavior also constitutes personal conduct and \nconcealment of information about his conduct that could create a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) correspond to similar mitigating conditions under the \nSexual Behavior guideline. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable and \u00b6 17(e) is partially \napplicable under the same rationale discussed above. Applicant has obtained \ncounseling and taken other positive steps to address his sexual problems. However, he \nrepeated his inappropriate behavior several weeks ago. He is clearly sincere in his \nattempts to control his behavior, but at this time the behavior is likely to recur. AG \u00b6 \n17(d) is partially applicable. Like the Sexual Behavior concerns, the Personal Conduct \nconcerns are still present despite the presence of some mitigation.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has suffered from sexual compulsion problems since his early teens. He \ncurtailed his incidents of exposing himself to women more than ten years ago because \nhe was afraid of being arrested. He continued to masturbate in semi-private places such \na parked car, bathroom stall, gym shower, and the bathroom on an airplane. When he \napplied for a security clearance in 1985, Applicant revealed his sexual issues as a \nyouth, but indicated they were in the past and he kept his problems hidden from the \nGovernment for many years. He finally revealed his problems during a polygraph and \ninterview pursuant to a request for access to SCI. He initiated counseling, obtained an \naccountability partner, and started attending a 12-step program after he was denied SCI \naccess. Applicant should be commended for his actions to address his problems. He is \nclearly sincere in his desire to control his compulsions. It is equally clear that he is not \nyet in complete control of himself. He has lessened his vulnerability to pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, and duress by his openness to his family and others about his \nproblems. I considered all of Applicant\u2019s favorable information. However, the sexual \nconduct is likely to recur and his vulnerability remains a very real concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under the Sexual Behavior \nand Personal Conduct guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

During a six month period, Applicant fondled his former \ngirlfriend\u2019s 11-year-old daughter on four occasions. Applicant has failed to rebut or \nmitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under sexual behavior, personal conduct, \nand information technology. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \n1 \nAugust 17, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 11, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nsexual behavior, personal conduct, and information technology. \n  \n \nOn March 11, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nMay 27, 2009, I was assigned the case. On June 5, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on June 25, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified \non his own behalf. On July 6, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. The record closed \non June 25, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nHe admitted the remaining factual allegations, with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nto the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old communications engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 1998, and is seeking to maintain security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant had a job in the information technology (IT) field working on the local \narea network and administering firewalls. His job was to monitor the network looking for \nintrusions. When bored at work, he would view pornographic material. From 2000 to \nOctober 2005, Applicant downloaded and viewed pornographic images and movies on a \nU.S. Government owned computer. (Ex. 4) He had downloaded more than 500 \npornographic images and approximately 25 pornographic movies. Nothing was stored \non the computer. Once the movies were watched or the images viewed, they were \ndeleted. (Tr. 32) \n \n \nApplicant asserted his viewing preference is younger women, not necessarily \nteens, and definitely not underage individuals. Earlier, he had stated his preference was \nfor pre-teen, teen, and \u201cbarely-legal\u201d females. (Ex. 4) Occasionally, Applicant viewed \nchild pornography, but never searched for it. In the search engine he would put in \n\u201cyounger, teen, barely legal.\u201d (Tr. 33, 43) Periodically, links would take him to \ninappropriate sites, which he asserts he would close once he discovered the content. \nHe asserts he has no interest in child pornography. Since he browses the internet more \nat home than at work, the child pornography would inadvertently come up more often at \nhome than at work. (Tr. 46) The last time child pornography inadvertently came up was \nsix or seven months ago. (Tr. 50) \n \n \nIn 2005, some co-workers were caught viewing pornographic material. The \nprogram manager issued a general warning to all employees that such behavior would \nnot be tolerated in the future. (Tr. 32) Applicant states the warning was not directly \nspecifically to him. Earlier, around 2000 or 2001, a colleague who noticed Applicant\u2019s \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n2 \n\nactivity and told Applicant he should discontinue such activity. Applicant denies he \ndownloaded pornographic images on his government computer after receiving the \nsecond warning.  \n \n \nApplicant no longer views pornographic material at work. Work has instituted \nmore measures of monitoring productivity and activity on computers. (Tr. 52) \nAdditionally, it is clear that his employer will not tolerate such behavior. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges some of his behavior showed non-compliance with rules \nand regulations at work. In the late 1990s, Applicant masturbated two or three times \nwhile viewing pornography at work. (Tr. 94) This occurred when Applicant was alone \nduring weekend shifts or during an overnight shift. (Tr. 35, 53) Applicant acknowledges \nhis conduct showed a severe lack of judgment. He stated he was younger and \nimmature and did it when he was on a shift alone.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in El Salvador and periodically visits family there. (Ex. 1) \nThirty to forty percent of the time, when he returns to El Salvador, he would frequent \nprostitutes. (Tr. 65) When he goes to adult entertainment clubs with his brothers, he \ndoes not have sex with prostitutes. (Tr. 66) If he attends with friends, he sometimes \ndoes. He prefers his brothers not know about his activities with prostitutes out of \ncourtesy or respect to his brothers. (Tr. 111) Applicant engaged in sexual relationships \nwith prostitutes in El Salvador. He learned after the fact that one of the prostitutes was \n16 years old. (Tr. 61) She had told him she was 18. (Tr. 63) He discovered her age \nbecause she had told him she had a child when she was 14 and later told him the child \nwas two years old. (Tr. 63) Prostitution is legal in El Salvador and brothels do enforce \nan 18-year-age limit on prostitutes. Applicant assumes the woman used false \ndocuments to get her job.  \n \n \nApplicant has used his home computer to browse pornographic sites where the \nsubjects look underage. He told an investigator that ten percent of the pornography he \nviewed at home contained underage subjects. (Ex. 4) At the hearing, he stated the \nsubjects were not underage and that five percent of his viewing was of younger women. \n \n \nFrom 1998 through 2004, Applicant dated a woman. (Tr. 54, 74-75) She lived in \nher parent\u2019s home. When Applicant stayed overnight he would sleep in the same bed as \nhis girlfriend, her daughter, and her son. During a six month period in 2003, Applicant \nfondled his former girlfriend\u2019s 11-year-old daughter on four occasions. (Tr. 73) The \nfondling was limited to touching the daughter\u2019s buttocks outside her clothing. He states \nhis former girlfriend and her daughter were about the same height. Applicant does not \nfully remember the events as they happened. He says there are \u201cjust flashes here and \nthere of uncertainty.\u201d (Tr. 110) The number of times it occurred is not based on his \nmemory of the events, but on what the girl told her mother. The mother then confronted \nApplicant about his conduct. Applicant stated, \u201cI felt really like guilty about it.\u201d (Tr. 57)  \n \nEach time the fondling occurred, Applicant and his girlfriend had been out late at \nnight clubs and he was very drunk, exhausted, and disoriented. (Tr. 36, 37) At the \n3 \n\nhearing Applicant stated, \u201c. . . I still think it\u2019s possible that I erroneously thought it was \nmy girlfriend at the time. . .\u201d (Tr. 37) He also said he \u201c. . . was just very ashamed really.\u201d \nAt the time the events occurred, Applicant stated he had \u201cdrank heavily.\u201d (Tr. 93)  \n \n \nEventually, Applicant stopped sleeping in the same bed with his girlfriend and her \nchildren and started sleeping on the floor. (Tr. 111) His girlfriend moved into her \nparent\u2019s basement where there was more room and then moved to her own home \nwhere her children had their own room. (Tr. 38)  \n \n \nIn the early 2000s, his girlfriend and parents expressed a concern that Applicant \nwas drinking too much. (Tr. 87) From 2000 to March 2006, Applicant suffered from \nblackouts while drinking. (Ex. 4) From 2003 to September 2004, he blacked out every \nother month. From September 2004 to January 2006, he was blacking out every month. \n(Tr. 91) He stated from 1998 until September 2004 he drove under the influence of \nalcohol twice a month. From 2004 until January 2006, he drove under the influence one \nor twice a week. (Tr. 91) At the hearing, he stated if he had one or two beers, he \nconsidered himself to be under the influence. (Tr. 92)  \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant\u2019s access to classified information and his access to \nspecial compartmented information (SCI) were suspended. (Ex. 4) In March 2008, his \nsecurity clearance was suspended. (Ex. 2) His access was suspended based upon a \ndecision by another government agency to deny his access to SCI. (Ex. 2) Applicant \nasked his company security representative for assistance in answering his Electronic \nQuestionnaires for National Security Positions (e-QIP). (Ex. 1) He was asked if he had \never been \u201cdenied\u201d a clearance. The security representative told him to answer \u201cno\u201d \nbecause his clearance was suspended and not denied. (Tr. 30)  \n \n \nThe majority of the derogatory information was obtained during a voluntary \npolygraph. Applicant was given the opportunity for a top secret clearance with SCI \naccess. He did not need this level of clearance to perform his current job. (Tr. 39) At the \npolygraph, Applicant believed he needed to be as forthcoming as possible and divulge \nas much information as was needed. (Tr. 21)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 12 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to sexual behavior : \n \nThe Concern: Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a \npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, \nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, \nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse \ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely \non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n5 \n\n \nOn four occasions he fondled his former girlfriend\u2019s 11-year-old daughter by \ngrabbing her buttocks. Applicant said he had been drinking and was confused between \nhis girlfriend and her daughter who were about the same size. He engaged in sexual \nrelations with a 16-year-old prostitute In El Salvador. He continues to view pornographic \nmaterial on his home computer of very young females.  \n \n \nApplicant states that five percent of the pornography he has viewed at home \ncontains underage subjects. He states this was unintentional, inadvertent, and \naccidental viewing. Initially he acknowledged the material was child pornography, but on \nfurther reflection he asserted he was only seeking \u201cteen\u201d or \u201cyounger women\u201d and not \nchild pornography.  \n \n \nEven though he was not prosecuted, AG \u00b6 13(a) \u201csexual behavior of a criminal \nnature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted\u201d applies to his fondling of the \n11-year-old girl and the viewing of child pornography. He engaged in sexual relations \nwith a 16-year-old prostitute in El Salvador. Prostitution is legal in El Salvador and \nApplicant was not aware the prostitute was underage until after they had sexual \nrelations. I find AG \u00b6 13(a) does not apply to his actions with the prostitute.  \n \nApplicant acknowledges some of his behavior showed non-compliance with rules \nand regulations at work. In the late 1990s, Applicant masturbated two or three times \nwhile viewing pornography at work. This occurred with Applicant was alone during \nweekend shift or during an overnight shift. He continued to view pornographic material \nat work after being warned not to do so.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(d) \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment,\u201d applies to his viewing of pornographic material at work and his \nmasturbating while watching pornographic material at work.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred during or prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. AG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply because the \nbehavior occurred after adolescence. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply because the behavior \ndid not happen long ago and was not infrequent. He downloaded 500 pornographic \nimages and 25 pornographic movies, which is not infrequent. He fondled his former \n6 \n\ngirlfriend\u2019s daughter four times over a six month period, which certainly casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. To have it happen once is \ninexcusable, but to continue sleeping in the same bed with his girlfriend and her children \nafter the first time is unforgivable.  \n \n \nApplicant is likely to continue viewing adult material of very young women on his \nhome computer. Initially, Applicant said ten percent of the material on his home \ncomputer contained underage material. He later reduced his estimate to five percent.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) does not apply because Applicant does not want his brothers to know \nhe frequents prostitutes while in El Salvador. There is no evidence who, if anyone other \nthan the company\u2019s security officials, knows of Applicant\u2019s conduct. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not \napply because the viewing of pornographic material and masturbation at work was not \nstrictly private, consensual, or discreet behavior. \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant has failed to take responsibility for his actions. His excuse \nfor viewing of pre-teen pornography was because the search engines inadvertently took \nhim there. He groped his ex-girlfriend\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, because she was about \nthe same size as his girlfriend and he had been drinking. His excuse for masturbating at \nwork while watching pornographic movies and other pornographic material was \nbecause there was no one else around and he was bored. A coworker told him he \nshould not view pornographic material at work, but Applicant chose to do so anyway. It \nwas not until a warning was issued to all personnel that he finally stopped viewing the \nmaterial on the government computer. \n \nThe passage of time since the events is a factor to be considered. However, the \npassage of time, in and of itself, is not the controlling factor. The nature and relevant \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct must also be considered. It is the intentional \nacts plus Applicant\u2019s failure to take responsibility for his conduct that is controlling. He \nknew his conduct was inappropriate, but he continued to do it anyway. Applicant \nacknowledges his conduct showed a severe lack of judgment.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the adjudicative guidelines states \na concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \nA government agency denied Applicant\u2019s SCI access and his personal security \nclearance granted as a contractor was suspended. He continued to view pornographic \nmaterial on the government computer after having been told to stop. He stopped after a \n7 \n\nwarning was issued to everyone. His viewing of pornographic material at work, \nmasturbating at work, and fondling his former girlfriend\u2019s 11-year-old daughter are \nconduct which shows questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nUnder the Directive, an applicant may mitigate the security concerns arising from \nquestionable personal conduct under certain circumstances. AG \u00b617 provides \nconditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) \u201cif a person \u201cprovides the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts,\u201d does not apply because omissions have not been alleged. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not \napply because there was no refusal or failure to cooperate.  \n \n \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply. As previously stated, the \nbehavior did not happen long ago and was not infrequent. The fondling of an 11-year-\nold is not a minor incident. There is no evidence his conduct occurred under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged some of his behavior was inappropriate, but there has \nbeen no counseling and there is no evidence of positive steps to alleviate the stressors \nor evidence the behavior is unlikely to recur. Mitigating factor AG \u00b6 17(d) \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur\u201d does not apply. \n \nThere is no evidence of what steps, if any, Applicant has taken to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Even Applicant\u2019s brother \nare unaware he frequents prostitutes. Mitigating factor AG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has \ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress\u201d does not apply.  \n \nApplicant=s inappropriate conduct is substantiated by his admissions and \ngovernment exhibits. The information was pertinent to a determination of his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 17(f) provides mitigation where \u201cthe information \nwas unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d This mitigating factor \ndoes not apply. There was no allegation of association with other persons involved in \ncriminal activity other than frequenting prostitutes. The prostitution was legal where it \noccurred. Mitigating factor AG \u00b6 17(g) \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal \nactivity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations\u201d does not apply.  \n8 \n\n \nGUIDELINE M, Misuse of Information Technology Systems  \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 39 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to misuse of information technology systems : \n \nThe Concern. Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, \ncalling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive \nsystems, networks, and information. Information Technology Systems \ninclude all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data \nused for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, \nstorage, and protection of information.  \n \n \nBetween 2000 and October 2005, Applicant viewed and downloaded \npornographic images and pornographic movies onto a government owned computer. A \nco-worker warned Applicant to discontinue such activity. Applicant did not do so until co-\nworkers were caught viewing pornographic material and the program manager issued a \ngeneral warning to all employees that such behavior would not be tolerated in the \nfuture. AG \u00b6 40(e) \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem\u201d applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one=s \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and  \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41(a) applies only partially. It has been less than four years since the last \nbehavior at work. Applicant no longer views pornographic material at work because of \nthe warning and because work has instituted more measures of monitoring productivity \nand activity on computers. He is unlikely to view pornography at work again. However, \nthe serious nature of the misconduct raises a security concern. \n \n9 \n\nAG \u00b6 41(b) and AG \u00b6 41(c) do not apply because the misuse was not minor nor \nwas the conduct unintentional or inadvertent. The conduct was not followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation. Even after being warned he continued \nto view pornography until the program manager gave a warning to all personnel.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \nApplicant acknowledges some of his behavior showed non-compliance with rules \nand regulations at work and his conduct shows a severe lack of judgment. However, he \ndoes not accept the inappropriate nature of his conduct and instead offers excuses. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual behavior, \npersonal conduct, and misuse of information technology systems. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Sexual Behavior: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f\u20141.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n10 \n\n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a\u20142c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Information Technology: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 22, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on April 28, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nJuly 25, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Security clearance application, dated July 17, 2007) at 11; AE A (Letter, dated June 23, 2008); AE B\n1\n(Letter, dated June 18, 2008); AE C (Letter, dated June 26, 2008); AE D (Letter, signed June 26, 2008), Tr.\n33; AE G (Letter, dated June 28, 2008); AE L (Performance appraisals).\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request in May 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on May 16, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled\non June 30, 2008. The government offered five exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness\ntestified on his behalf. He submitted 12 exhibits (AE) A through L, which were received\nand admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on July 11, 2008. I held the record open until July 15, 2008, for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters.  On July 14, 2008, he submitted nine additional documents,\nwhich have been marked as AE M through U and admitted without objection. The\nrecord closed on July 15, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nThe file indicates that Applicant received the hearing notice on June 20, 2008,\nless than 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 10.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6\nE3.1.8 of the Directive to receive notice of the hearing 15 days prior to the hearing.\nApplicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice. (Tr. at 10-11.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 28, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.f of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h of the SOR and the concern. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 38 years old, works as warehouse specialist and tire inspector\nfor a Department of Defense contractor. He began this job in October 2005. His co-\nworkers describe him as honest, reliable and hard-working. He is a very responsible\nemployee, charged with the responsibility of managing millions of dollars of equipment\ninventory. His most recent performance evaluation was a commendable, the second\nhighest rating for employees. He completed his security clearance application in July\n2007.1\nApplicant and his wife married 17 years ago. They have three children, ages 16\nto 7. In 1994, Applicant started a carpet and flooring business, which he did not\nincorporate. He paid cash for all his supplies and any necessary subcontractor work. He\ndid not keep receipts or good financial books. He did set aside money for personal\nincome taxes. When he prepared his tax return for 1994, he based his income on an\nestimate of the business income and his wife\u2019s documented income. He filed his tax\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 18, Tr. 41, 49-59, 63.\n2\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 13; Tr. 49-52, 93.\n3\nGE 3 (Bankruptcy court documents); Tr. 53-56, 103.\n4\nGE 5 (Credit report, dated May 16, 2008); AE Q (Tax liens for 1999 and 2002); Tr. 60, 74, 83.\n5\nTr. 43-49, 66-72, 89-91.\n6\n3\nreturn under his and his wife\u2019s social security numbers, but did not file a separate return\nfor the business. After computing his tax liability, he determined that he did not have\nenough money for all the taxes he owed.  \n2\nIn 1995, Applicant worked towards paying the remaining taxes owed for 1994. At\nthe same time, he failed to set aside money for his 1995 taxes. He experienced\nproblems with earning enough money to pay the 1994 taxes and meet his household\nexpenses. He continued to experience this financial problem each year while operating\nhis business. Each year he filed his income as personal taxes and each year he lacked\nsufficient money to pay his entire tax bill. He closed his business in January 2003, and\nstarted working for a dry cleaners.3\nWhen Applicant did not pay his taxes due, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nfiled liens to collect the outstanding taxes. The initial liens covered the tax years 1994\nthrough 1998. In 2002, the IRS suggested Applicant and his wife file for bankruptcy as a\nway to eliminate their tax debt. They followed the advice of the IRS. The court\ndischarged their debts in 2002, including their tax debts for the years 1994 through\n1998. The IRS released these tax liens in 2006.4\nIn 2002, the IRS filed a tax lien for the tax year 1999, in 2003 for the tax years\n2000 and 2001, and in 2006 for the tax year 2002. At one point, Applicant and his wife\nmade an offer of compromise to the IRS on these tax debts. The IRS rejected their offer\nof compromise.  \n5\nIn 2001, Applicant shattered his ankle. Although he sought medical treatment on\nseveral occasions, physicians did not diagnose a problem until one year after his injury.\nHis ankle injury required four surgeries between December 2002 and July 2004. He\ndeveloped a severe infection following his April 2004 surgery, which resulted in two\nadditional surgeries. He missed work from January 2003 through July 2003, and April\n2004 through September 2004. He did not have disability insurance to cover his lost\nincome. He did have medical insurance, which paid most, but not all, of his medical\nexpenses related to his medical care. His co-pays for his medical care totaled about\n$5,000. During this time, his wife worked full-time, earning $9 an hour. Her income was\ninsufficient to pay all the household expenses, the taxes, and medical bills.  \n6\nIn 2006, Applicant owed approximately $30,670 on his federal tax debt for the\nfour years 1999 through 2002, including interest and penalties. In April 2006, he and his\n\nAE I (IRS documents 2008); AE O (IRS documents); AE P (IRS documents); Tr. 60-62, 77-87.\n7\nAE R (Letter IRS, dated June 5, 2007); AE S (IRS payment notices and status - August 2006 through\n8\nDecember 2007); GE 2, (Interrogatories, answer with attachments); Tr. 61, 77.  \nGE 2, supra note 8; AE (Payments); AE N (payments); AE T (Cancelled check); Tr. 64-66, 72.\n9\nGE 2, supra note 8, attachments; AE E (Letter, dated June 25, 2008); AE F (Letter, dated June 24, 2008);\n10\nAE H (Letter, signed June 26, 2008) Tr. 34; Tr. 24-29, 101-103.\n4\nwife made a second offer of compromise to the IRS. After discussions, they reached an\nagreement with the IRS to repay the above tax debt. They agreed to pay the IRS $125 a\nmonth. In addition, the IRS would apply any tax refund to their debt and Applicant\nagreed not to operate another business. Their tax withholding amount from their\npaychecks is more than is necessary to pay their taxes each year. Thus, each year their\ntax refund is applied to their tax debt. The IRS also applied their 2008 economic\nstimulus to their outstanding tax debt.  \n7\nApplicant has paid the IRS, as agreed, since August 2006. He reduced the tax\ndebt for the year 1999 by more than $7,000. In 2007, the IRS provided information to a\npotential mortgagor, which allowed them to purchase their current home.8\nThe SOR reflects two unpaid medical bills, totaling $432. These bills are the\nremaining debt from his ankle injury. In December 2005, Applicant started paying $30 a\nmonth on these bills, which totaled almost $1,000. He paid the bill in full on June 21,\n2008. They intend to add this $30 payment to their monthly IRS payment.9\nApplicant and his wife earn approximately $4,300 in gross monthly income. Their\nnet monthly income is approximately $3,765 and their monthly expense total $3,700,\nincluding their payments to the IRS. They developed a budget, live within their monthly\nincome, and do not spend excessively. Family and friends describe Applicant as honest,\nhardworking and trustworthy.10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\nThe remaining mitigating conditions are not applicable in this case.\n11\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant unpaid federal tax debt when he\noperated his business. He also accumulated some unpaid medical expenses from his\nankle injury. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s tax\nproblems arose from his business operations and poor financial management of\nbusiness income and expenses. He stopped operating his business five and one-half\nyears ago and has no intent to operate another business. Thus, he is no longer\naccumulating more tax debt. Yearly tax monies are withheld from his paycheck and are\nsufficient to cover his taxes and entitle him to a refund, which is applied to his debt. With\nthe close of his business, his tax issues are not going to continue or reoccur in the\nfuture. His past tax issues do not raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating\ncondition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Some of the financial\nproblems arose from his medical problems, including the substantial medical bills and\nlengthy periods of unemployment. By faithfully making monthly payments on his medical\nbills for two and one-half years, he acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these\ndebts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ While did not Applicant received financial counseling, he paid\nhis outstanding medical bills in full. He and his wife also initiated and negotiated a\nresolution of their tax problems with the IRS in 2006. They have made the required\nmonthly payment for the last two years and the IRS has applied their tax refunds and\neconomic stimulus to their debt. They are resolving this delinquent debt. He is now\nfinancially sound and lives within his budget. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply.11\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s tax problems arose, not\nbecause he did not file his tax returns, but because he managed his business finances\npoorly. He did not incorporate his business nor did he keep good financial records. He\ntreated his business income the same as personal income for taxes. This decision led to\ntax issues with the IRS because he failed to save sufficient income to pay his personal\ntaxes. From the beginning, he did not avoid his taxes; rather, he attempted to pay the\ntaxes he owed. He, however, did not earn sufficient income to pay the past taxes owed\nand his current taxes, causing his tax liability to increase each year. He eliminated five\nyears of tax debts through bankruptcy, at the suggestion of the IRS. He is paying the\nremaining four years of debt and has for the last two years. He paid his outstanding\nmedical bills over a period of two and one-half years. He did not avoid this bill; instead,\nhe made small monthly payments until he paid the bills in full. \nApplicant and his wife developed a budget and follow it. They pay their bills\nmonthly. Applicant does not violate the law and lives a modest live style. He has always\naccepted responsibility for his debts and tried to pay them. He is married and has three\nchildren. As a result, he has focused his attention on providing a stable domestic\nenvironment for his family. Most significantly, he has taken affirmative action to pay or\nresolve the delinquent debts raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) He has not\nbeen able to pay his tax bill in full, but has remained faithful to the repayment\nagreement. This debt cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course,\nthe issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While tax\ndebt is not paid in full, it is insufficient to raise security concerns because he assumed\n\n8\nresponsibility for the debt long before he applied for a security clearance. (See AG &\n2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 5, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 17, 2008, Department \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, and mailed \nApplicant a complete copy on July 21, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on July 25, \n2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. On August 18, 2008, DOHA received additional information from Applicant. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the materials. On August 22, 2008, I was \nassigned the case. I marked Applicant\u2019s submission as Exhibit (AE) 1.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 5, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR, with explanations.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and was born in the United States in 1975. Her mother \n(now deceased) was a U.S. citizen and her father is a Canadian citizen. In 1980, the \nfamily moved to Canada from the United States. She lived in Canada until 1994, when \nshe returned to the United States to attend college. During the summer months, she \nlived with her family in Canada. After graduating from college in 1998, she returned to \nCanada to live and work for a Canadian company. She visited the United States \nfrequently for work and to see friends. In July 2004, Applicant returned to the United \nStates to live and work, permanently, while pursuing a graduate degree.  \n \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant began a position, as a senior client manager, with her \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor. In July 2005, she completed an e-QIP. \nSometime in 2006, she completed her graduate program. In June 2006, she voted in a \nCanadian election. In her August 2008 Response to the FORM regarding her decision \nto vote in that election, she stated: \n \nAt the time of the Canadian election in 2006, [I] had lived in that country \nfor that majority of [my] life, and [my] emotional connection to Canada was \nstrong. [My] present ties to the country are fewer, and [my] current \nwillingness to renounce [my] Canadian citizenship in favor of sole United \nStates citizenship demonstrate that further exercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship, including involvement with Canadian \nelectoral procedures, is unlikely. (AE 1 at 2). \n \nShe further stated in the Response that she recently voted in a state \nprimary in February 2008, and \u201chas no intentions of voting in any future Canadian \nelections.\u201d (Id. at 3).   \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant purchased a home in the United States. She has a \nsignificant relationship with a U.S. citizen, who has been a federal employee for 15 \nyears. (Id. at 4). She works for a U.S. company. She has \u201clived in the United States for a \nsignificant part of her adult life and has planted roots here, demonstrating an intent to \nremain in the US and her preference for that country.\u201d (Id. at 6). \u201cSince taking up \n\n \n3 \n \n \npermanent residence in the US, [she] has developed stronger ties to US interests and \nhas lost touch with many Canadian friends and associates. She now visits Canada only \n1 or 2 times per year to see family.\u201d (Id. at 3). \n \nApplicant obtained her first U.S. passport on December 27, 2005. Prior to \nthat, she used a Canadian passport to travel back and forth between the \ncountries, including trips in August 2005, October 8, 2005, October 16, 2005, and \nduring a trip over the 2005 holidays. (Item 5 at 138). Since receiving her U.S. \npassport, she has not used her Canadian passport. After learning of the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns, Applicant surrendered her Canadian passport \nto her Facility Security Officer, who destroyed it in February 2008.  (AE 1 at 144). \nShe did not realize that using her Canadian passport instead of her U.S. passport \ncould be construed as an indication of one\u2019s national preference. (Id. at 6). She is \nwilling to renounce her Canadian citizenship in favor of the United States. (Id. at \n144). \n \nApplicant\u2019s past actions, which served as the basis for the two allegations \nin the SOR, were not willful or negligent, but rather the result of a lack of \ninformation. She asserts that her \u201cpreference is with the United States and \nknowing that these actions were seen as negative is troubling and not indicative \nof her intentions or preference.\u201d (Id. at 3). She believes that the \u201cfuture exercise \nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship is highly unlikely.\u201d (Id. at \n6).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 sets forth the security concern involving foreign preference that arises: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case \nestablished two of them: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n \n \n*      *      * \n\n \n5 \n \n \n (7) voting in a foreign election. \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1975. She had a Canadian passport \nthat she used for travel between the United States and Canada until she obtained a \nU.S. passport at the end of December 2005. In February 2008, the Canadian passport \nwas destroyed.  In July 2004, she decided to live permanently in the United States. In \nJune 2006, she voted in a Canadian election. Based on the evidence in the record, \nincluding Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government produced substantial evidence of \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) and  AG \u00b6 10(a)(7). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those conditions, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the resulting \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 11 provides eleven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Those with potential application in this case are: \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country;  \n (b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on her father\u2019s Canadian citizenship, which \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 11(a). After becoming aware that her Canadian passport \ncould potentially have an adverse effect on her employment, she destroyed it in \nFebruary 2008. Hence, AG \u00b6 11(e) applies. In her Answer to the SOR and Response to \nthe FORM, she emphasized that she was unaware that her actions could be interpreted \nas her preference for Canada over the United States, and she would willingly renounce \nher Canadian citizenship. In addition, she demonstrated her loyalty to the United States, \nbased on strong connections to it, such as her intention to live here permanently, \nearning a graduate degree from a U.S. university, her relationship with a U.S. citizen, \nwho works for the federal government, the purchase of property, employment with a \nU.S. company for four years, and voting in a recent U.S. election. As a result of her \nwillingness to renounce her Canadian citizenship and her current ties to the United \nStates, I conclude AG \u00b6 11(b) applies.   \nIn support of the application of AG \u00b6 11(b), I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s opinion in \nISCR Case No. 03-4300 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006) that held the following: \nIn concluding Applicant had mitigated the security concerns raised by her \nacts of foreign preference by application of Guideline C Mitigating \nCondition 4, the Administrative Judge articulated a rational explanation for \nher determination\u2014basing it on such factors as the Applicants\u2019 strong ties \nand loyalties to the United States, the extensive effort undertaken by the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant to surrender her passport and renounce her Russian citizenship \nbefore the close of the record, and the fact that Applicant\u2019s lack of \nawareness concerning the requirements expressed in the ASDC3I memo \nand the Guideline C Mitigating Conditions may have affected the timing of \nher renunciation actions. There are no stated requirements in Guideline C \nMitigating Condition 4 concerning when an applicant is required to comply \nwith its provisions.1  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential \nconcern under Guideline C resulted from two choices she made after she decided to \npermanently move to the United States in July 2004. Since learning of the significance \nof her past actions, she destroyed her passport in February 2008 (before the SOR \nissued), expressed a willingness to renounce her Canadian citizenship, and asserted \nher preference for the United States. She is building a future here with her employer \nand friends. There is no other derogatory information in the record.  Based on the \nevidence, I do not believe she is a threat to the United States. She made two mistakes \nthat she is unlikely to repeat.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under foreign preference.  \n                                                          \n1 Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 4 under the previous adjudicative Guideline C, stated \nas follows: \u201cIndividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d E2.A3.1.3.4. The \nASDC31 memo referenced does not have applicability to this case and pertained to the surrender of \nforeign passports. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Judge: \u201cYou make $12,000 a month?\u201d  Applicant: \u201cYes.\u201d\nJudge: \u201cAnd that is after taxes and other deductions?\u201d Applicant: \u201cYes.\u201d  Transcript at 88.

On May 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 5, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which indicated that Applicant\u2019s\ninability to satisfy his outstanding debts was due to a period of underemployment and the collapse\nof the housing market.  He also contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact give a distorted picture of\nhis financial situation.  Finally, Applicant notes that he has never compromised classified\ninformation.  Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.\n(1) The Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported\nby substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.

Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s house was foreclosed on in August 2007, and he owed the mortgage company over $11,000.  He\n3\nhad not made any payments on that debt and stated that he intended to file for bankruptcy to discharge it after he had paid\nother delinquent debts.  Decision at 3.\n3\n(2) The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct\nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n22325 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to\nconsideration of work performance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n08623 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant\nactually mishandles or fails safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to\nsuch information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of\nsecurity violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).\n(3) The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.   In light of the foregoing,\n3\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to several of the\nSOR allegations.   However, she reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient\nto overcome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nThe favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision\nunder Guideline F are sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 11, 2008, denied all the \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.

In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He came to the U.S. in 1995 after he was exiled from \nhis native country of Cameroon and was a refugee from Nigeria. He was a pro-\ndemocracy student leader and the U.S. offered him the opportunity to immigrate. \nApplicant immediately enrolled in college to learn English. He received a database \nsoftware certificate at a community college and a master\u2019s in business administration in \n2000.1 He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2001. Applicant married in 2000 and \nseparated from his wife in March 2006. Their divorce was final on June 28, 2008. He \nhas a six-year-old son from the marriage.  \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant set up an information technology consulting corporation where \nhe was the President and its only employee. This corporation had its own business \ncredit card which Applicant used to make purchases such as furniture, office supplies, \nand computer equipment. He did not use this credit card for personal use. Applicant \noperated the corporation out of his home. He stated he relied on the money made \nthrough the corporation to pay the corporation\u2019s bills. When asked \u201cdid you give any \nthought to if you couldn\u2019t pay the bills, how they were going to get paid? His response \nwas \u201cnot really.\u201d He presently is working as employee of a government contractor.2  \n \n \nIn June 2006 Applicant bought a house for $647,000. He used $20,000 cash for \na down payment. His monthly mortgage payments were $5,600. At the time his \ncorporation had a contract where he was being paid approximately $18,000 a month. \nHe lost the contract and was unemployed from August 2006 to October 23, 2006. He \ncontinued to make his mortgage payments. Although he was separated from his wife \nand child when he purchased the house, he explained he purchased the large house to \nuse as an investment, hoping to sell it in the future for a profit. He also purchased it to \nhelp other Cameroon immigrants, by providing them a temporary residence. He would \nprovide his home as temporary shelter. None of the temporary residents contributed to \nthe expenses associated with the house. Applicant estimated that he donates \napproximately $500 to $1,000 a month to assist the residents. This money is a gift and \nnot a loan, so it is not repaid.3  \n \n \n1 It is unknown if Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Cameroon or from another institution.  \n \n2 Tr. 40-46, 51-55, 72-75. \n \n3 Tr. 59-62,106-114-117, 132-139. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s taxes increased on the house, increasing his escrow account and his \nmonthly mortgage payment by about $500. He resumed employment in October 2006 \nuntil November 2007, earning approximately $12,000 net income a month. Applicant \nbegan falling behind on his mortgage payments in June 2007. He changed jobs and \nwas employed for a few weeks before he realized the job was not as described. He was \nunemployed approximately three months from December 2007 to February 2008 and \nbegan working full time in March 2008. His current net income per month is \napproximately $12,000. His house was foreclosed on August 28, 2007. Appellant owes \nthe mortgage company $11,289 as alleged in SOR \u00b61.d. He has not made any \npayments on this debt, but stated he intends to file for bankruptcy to discharge this debt \nafter he pays other delinquent debts.4  \n \n \nAppellant made payments to settle the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.c, 1.e. and \n1.f. They have been resolved and satisfied.5  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR \u00b61.a is for a credit card account. Applicant has made \none $50 payment toward this charged off debt of $3,607. He stated he has a verbal \nagreement with the credit card company to begin making $50 monthly payments in \nSeptember 2008. He bought a laptop computer, software and other computer hardware \nwith this credit card.6  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR \u00b61.b is a credit card debt that was charged off for \n$12,531. Applicant stated that it was a business credit card for his corporation. Furniture \nand office supplies were charged to the account in 2006. Applicant admitted he is \nresponsible for paying the debt. No information was provided to show that the debt was \na business account loss or that Applicant is not responsible for this debt. It is unclear \nwhy Applicant did not pay this debt in 2006 when he was employed or since then. \nApplicant has not made any payments on this debt, but stated he intended to pay it off. \nHe stated he had a verbal agreement with the company to pay the debt. His corporation \nhas not done any work since 2006.7  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he intended to pay both delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and \n1.b and intended to file for bankruptcy to resolve the foreclosure debt in SOR \u00b61.d. He \nhas not contacted the creditor regarding this debt. These three debts total \napproximately $27,370. He stated he expected to pay off the two credit card debts in \napproximately 16 months by paying $1,000 a month. Applicant spoke to an attorney \nwhile his house was being foreclosed, but never retained one.

AE D, K, and N reflect payments for SOR 1.e. \n \n6 Tr. 28-30, 55-56. \n \n7 Tr. 30-35, 72-74. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ncounseling. He has an accountant that prepares his tax returns who advised him \nagainst filing for bankruptcy and that he should only do it as a last resort.8  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s present net monthly income is approximately $12,000. He rents a \nhouse for $3,000 a month. He has about $900 in savings. His other monthly expenses \nare: car payment, $867; student loan, $258 (balance approximately $53,000); alimony, \n$1,000; child support, $1,200; electricity, $200; car insurance, $235; telephone, $200;9 \ncable services, $200; gas, $400; lawn service, $50; and food/restaurants, $1,500.10 In \naddition, he sends $1,000 a month to his family in Cameroon. He donates at least \n$2,000 to $3,000 a year to a charity that he runs for helping Cameroon citizens. He \nstated that in 2006 he donated approximately $10,000 to this charity. In 2007, he \nestimated he donated $2,000 to $3,000. In 2008, he estimated he donated \napproximately $2,000 to date. He donates another $500 to $1,000 to help friends and \nCameroon countrymen if they have a financial need. He recently (two weeks ago) gave \nhis girlfriend $500 to help with her school expenses. In addition, in the last eight weeks \nhe spent an additional $200 a week to pay for his son\u2019s swimming camp. He owes his \nwife\u2019s lawyer $10,000 for the cost of the divorce. Applicant has already paid his divorce \nattorney, but has decided to appeal the settlement and has made an initial payment of \n$1,000 toward a retainer for an appellate attorney. It is not known how much more the \nfees will entail. He has no retirement accounts or investments. Applicant does not have \na budget.11  \n \n \nAppellant credibly testified that when he completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA) he was told to only list government debts. He believed the debt listed \nin SOR \u00b61.b was the responsibility of the corporation and did not need to be listed. \nAlthough he was aware of the debt in SOR \u00b61.a he did not believe he had to list it. I find \nApplicant did not intentionally fail to divulge the requested information on his SCA. \nEnglish is not his native language and he credibly testified that he misunderstood what \nhe was to divulge.12  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n8 Tr. 26, 30-39, 82-86. \n \n9 He pays for his girlfriend\u2019s telephone service by allowing her to be on a family plan.  \n \n10 Applicant stated he does not cook so he eats at restaurants a lot. \n \n11 Tr. 87-106-127, 132-136. \n \n12 Tr. 40-48. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d); (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and (e) \n(\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive \nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other \nfinancial analysis\u201d). Despite having the income and assets to resolve his delinquent \ndebts Applicant has not done so and they remain unpaid. Applicant earns a significant \nincome and although he has paid some of his smaller debts since his security clearance \nbecame an issue, he has not addressed the three largest debts. Applicant has not made \nan effort to reflect on his expenditures and create a budget. He donates a great deal of \nmoney for worthy causes, but does so to the detriment of his creditors. Based on his \ndiscretionary income it does not appear Applicant is willing to make lifestyle changes \nand prioritize paying his delinquent debts. I find all three disqualifying conditions have \nbeen raised. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe individual has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because his three largest delinquent debts remain \nunpaid and it does not appear he has made budget or lifestyle changes to pay them in a \ntimely manner. Applicant has the ability to pay his delinquent debts, but he has made \nchoices on how he is spending his money. Paying his delinquent debts is not his top \npriority. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nfind (a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant did have periods of unemployment and went through a divorce. In \norder for (b) to apply Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant was earning a significant income of $18,000 a month when he lost the \ncontract and was unemployed for three months. When he returned to work he was \nearning less, but enough, if he budgeted his money to pay his bills. I cannot find \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Therefore, I find (b) only partially \napplies.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant has paid three of his creditors. He hopes to pay two others in the future \nand file for bankruptcy to discharge the deficiency amount on his foreclosed mortgage. I \ndo not find that he has exercised a good faith effort to resolve all of his delinquent debts. \nApplicant has the financial ability to pay his creditors, but he needs to budget his income \nand make some lifestyle changes. He has not done so. There is no evidence Applicant \nhas received any financial counseling to help him resolve his financial problems. \nTherefore I cannot find (c) or (d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d). I have considered all of the facts \nand find Applicant did not deliberately omit, conceal, or intentionally mislead and falsify \ninformation on his SCA. Applicant was advised to only list his government debts and he \nbelieved he did not have to list such debts. Applicant\u2019s native language is not English \nand communicating and understanding the intricacies of the SCA was confusing. I found \nhis testimony was credible and do not believe he intentionally omitted pertinent \ninformation. I find none of the disqualifying conditions apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is obviously a very \nbenevolent person. He contributes to a charity to help his former countrymen. He \nprovides temporary residence for them and gives them money when they need it. He \nalso sends money to his family back in Cameroon. These are all admirable acts of \ngenerosity. However, Applicant also has financial obligations to creditors that he \npromised to pay and is obligated to pay. He has not adjusted his budget to ensure they \nreceive payments. He does not have a working budget. He has expendable income that \nif budgeted properly he could responsibly pay his creditors. He has not done this. \nRather he intends to file bankruptcy to satisfy the foreclosure debt on his house and he \nplans to start paying $50 a month on a debt that is more than $12,000. He also stated \nhe planned on paying $1,000 on these debts, but had not begun making regular \npayments, regardless of the amount promised. Applicant has the means to resolve his \nfinancial problems, but has not changed his priorities. His nominal effort raises \nquestions about his judgment and reliability. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct, but failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLokey-Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions on April 30,\n2007.  On April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 27, 2008, and requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on July 2, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 8, 2008, scheduling the hearing for August 19, 2008.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8.\nThe Applicant presented eleven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K.\nThe record remained open until close of business on September 2, 2008, to allow the\nApplicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant submitted one\nPost-Hearing Exhibit, with eighteen enclosures, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits A through R.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on September 3, 2008.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 48 years old and divorced.  He has three years of college.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Fire Captain and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Statement of Reasons sets forth twelve separate creditors totaling\napproximately $ 26,000.00.  The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the\nSOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated June 14, 2007, January 28, 2008, April 23,\n2008 and July 2, 2008, reflect each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 2, 3, 5 and 6).\nThe Applicant testified that he has been married and divorced twice.  During his\nmarriages, he left the responsibility of handling the finances to his spouses.  Each of the\ndebts listed in the SOR occurred during his marriages.  About four years ago, the\nApplicant learned that his first ex-wife has stolen his identity.  She was fraudulently\nusing his credit line by running up debt after the marriage.  With regard to his second\nwife, accordingly to the divorce decree their debt from the marriage was to be split\nequally.  She, however, is having financial difficulties, and is unable to pay her part.\nThe Applicant was also involved in a motorcycle accident and then lost his job in March\n2007, which caused even more financial difficulties.    \nIn an effort to resolve his indebtedness, the Applicant contacted a financial credit\ncounselor to assist him in getting the debts paid, and/or removed from his credit report.\nHe also placed fraud alerts on his credit line with the credit agencies to inform them of\nthe identity theft.  At this point, he has either paid off the debt or has set up a payment\nplan that he will be following to completely resolve the debt over time.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits B and C).  The following debts listed in the SOR have been paid off by the\nApplicant; a debt to a creditor in the amount of $840.00 has been paid, (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit A), a debt to a creditor in the amount of $100.00 has been paid,\n(See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D), and a debt to a\ncreditor in the amount of $149.00 has been paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C). \n\n3\nThe following debts are currently being paid through a debt consolidation\nprogram entered into between the Applicant and his second ex-wife; a debt to a creditor\nin the amount of $13,623.00; a debt to a creditor in the amount of $1,481.00, a debt to a\ncreditor in the amount of $799.00; and a debt in the amount of $611.00.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits E, G and H). \nThe following debts were fraudulently incurred through identity theft committed by\nthe Applicant\u2019s ex-wife after their divorce; a debt to a creditor in the amount of\n$1,412.00; a debt in the amount of $204.00; a debt in the amount of $511.00, a debt in\nthe amount of $410.00; and a debt in the amount of $872.00.  The Applicant has filed a\npolice report against his ex-wife and has sent copies of the report to the creditors to\nhave them remove the debts from his credit report.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits I through L).\n              \nThe Applicant, in his capacity as a Fireman has received numerous certificates of\ntraining, participation and recognition.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  \nThe Applicant has received various awards and other commendations for his\ncontributions to his employer.  This includes, but is not limited to being honored for Fire\nOfficer of the Year, 2007, Fire Department Employee of the Month, July 2000,\nSupervisor of the Month and Supervisor of the Quarter.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I and\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit M, N, O, P, Q and R). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n\n4\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n\n5\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant\u2019s poor financial history was caused by a\ncombination of events; two marriages and divorces, identity theft by an ex-wife, a\nmotorcycle accident, and loss of employment.  Since then, the Applicant has worked\nhard to resolve his indebtedness.  He has hired a financial counselor to assist him.  He\nhas either paid off the debt, or has set up a payment plan to resolve it.  He plans to\ncontinue making payments toward the debts until they are paid in full.  He understands\nthe importance of paying his bills on time and not living beyond his means.  Under the\ncircumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is\nevidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can\nproperly handle his financial affairs.  In the event that the Applicant does not continue to\n\n6\npay his delinquent debts according to the payment plan or sooner if possible, his\nsecurity clearance will be in immediate jeopardy.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 20.(c) the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and 20.(d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts also apply.    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nThis Applicant has paid or is currently paying his delinquent debts.  He has\ndemonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the eligibility requirements for\naccess to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 for the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\n    Subpara.  1.g:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He \nhas been sober since October 2006 when he had his last drink of alcohol. He used \nmarijuana from 1990 through 1994 and again three times in January 2003. Applicant \nhas rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under alcohol \nconsumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 9, 2008, detailing security concerns under alcohol \nconsumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \n  \n \nOn June 4, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJune 16, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 23, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on August 14, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through10, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through E, which were admitted into evidence. \nThree other witnesses also testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The record was kept open to \nallow Applicant to submit additional matters. On August 25, 2008, additional documents \nwere received. There being no objection, the material was admitted into evidence as Ex. \nF. On August 21, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR, \nwith explanations. He also provided a letter from his doctor to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old systems analyst who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since March 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nperformance report ending September 2007 stated Applicant continued to increase his \nknowledge of mission operations and has the potential of becoming one of their better \nanalysts. Applicant\u2019s facilities manager states Applicant has been \u201ca model client. I have \npersonally reviewed all of his monthly reports.\u201d (Ex. F) A senior network analyst states, \nApplicant has a genuine concern for customers and the level of service provided. (Ex. \nF) Applicant\u2019s supervisor stated Applicant is attentive to work, a valuable team member, \nand in the top half of all analysts. (Tr. 37) His supervisor rates Applicant number two of \nthe seven people he supervises. (Tr. 44)  \n \n \nSince 1999, Applicant has received ten speeding tickets, of which three were \nreceived in 2008. (Ex. 8, 9, and 10) In April 2008, he received his last speeding ticket. \n(Tr. 30) Since 1992, he has received ten traffic tickets unrelated to speeding, which \nincluded failing to use a seatbelt, failure to yield, failure to appear, and other traffic \nrelated offenses. Applicant has a valid driver\u2019s license. His motor vehicle administration \n(MVA) record is shown in full in Ex. 2.  \n \nApplicant had a serious drinking problem. He admits he is an alcoholic and will \nbe an alcoholic until the day he dies.2 (Tr. 109, 149) He acknowledges he is alcohol \ndependent and bipolar. Applicant stated his last few months of drinking were \u201cespecially \n \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2Applicant states, \u201cI do not feel that I will ever drink again.  I still consider myself an alcoholic.  \nAlthough a sober alcoholic, I will always be an alcoholic to the day I die. I cannot consider myself a former \nalcoholic or a former drinker. \u201c (Tr.151)  \n\n \n \n \n3\n                                                          \ndark\u201d and \u201cpretty brutal.\u201d (Tr. 107) He would sit at home drinking with a shotgun in his \nmonth wondering if he should pull the trigger. Four or five times a week, he drank to \nintoxication, usually drinking until he passed out. (Tr. 108) He suffered blackouts. He \ndescribes himself as a stage 3 \u2500 stage 4 alcoholic, which he describes as the point \nwhere his alcohol use has caused physical health effects. (Tr. 110) At stage four, the \neffects of alcohol start to take a physical toll on the body. Applicant states his liver is \n\u201cmessed up.\u201d (Tr. 110)  \n \nFrom 1990 through 1994, he used marijuana and again three times in January \n2003. (Tr. 106) His previous use of marijuana, prior to the three times he used in 2003, \nwas 14 years ago at age 24. In May 1991, he was charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol (DUI) and received probation before judgment (PBJ). He attended a \nthree month treatment program. Under the state law, DUI\u2019s are not criminal offenses, \nbut traffic offenses.3 \n \n \nIn February 2002, Applicant began seeing a doctor for his bipolar disorder. \nApplicant was suffering from depression, fear, paranoia, agitation, and stress. (Ex. 3) \nApplicant knew something was wrong because he was frequently crying. (Tr. 99) In a \nMay 2008 letter, Applicant\u2019s doctor reports Applicant quickly responded to medication, \nApplicant has been stable for years, and both his bipolar disorder and alcohol \ndependence are in remission. (Ex. A) Applicant takes his treatment seriously. He sees \nhis doctor once a month. (Tr. 100) \n \nApplicant saw his marijuana use as an attempt to self-medicate prior to obtaining \npsychological help. (Tr. 106) On his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), standard form (SF) 86, dated April 2006 (Ex. 1), Applicant \nacknowledged, in response to Question 21, that he had consulted a mental health \nprofessional. In response to question 24, he acknowledged his marijuana use.  \n \n \nIn August 1992, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for one year. Applicant attended three months of counseling \nand narcotics anonymous (NA) meetings and was subject to urinalysis testing. Applicant \nlisted this arrest on his SF 86. The charge was nolle prosequi. (Tr. 97, Ex. 4) In 1993, \nhe was again charged with possession of marijuana and his license was suspended for \nanother year.  \n \n \nIn February 2006, he was charged with Drive While Impaired by Drug or Drugs \nand Alcohol (DWI \u2013 Drug). The charge was nolle prosequi when the arresting officer \nfailed to appear in court. Applicant listed the DWI \u2013 CDS on his SF 86. Applicant was \nunder a doctor\u2019s care for anxiety and took too much Klohopin, an anti-anxiety \nmedication which he had been described. (Tr. 105) \n \n \n3 If there is no evidence of a life-threatening injury, a DWI or similar offense is under the \nTransportation Article of the state code and not the criminal code. In the absence of a life-threatening \ninjury, the offense is a civil infraction. (Tr. 28, 96, Hearing Exhibit 1) \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nIn March 2006, Applicant was again charged with DWI \u2013 CDS, and also charged \nwith DWI \u2013 Drug, Failure to Stop after Accident Involving Damage to Attended Property, \nUnsafe Backing of a Motor Vehicle, Failure to Control Speed to Avoid Collision, and \nFailure to Return and to Remain at Scene of Accident involving Property Damages \n(Failure to Return). Applicant backed into a neighbor\u2019s fence. (Tr. 104) Applicant \nreceived probation before judgment for Failure to Return. (Ex. 5, p. 91) The other \ncharges were nolle prosequi. (Ex. 5)  \n \nUnder state law, DWI \u2013 CDS is not a criminal offense, but only a traffic offense. \nApplicant listed the DWI \u2013 CDS on his SF 86. Applicant had again taken too much \nprescription Klonopin. His anti-anxiety medicine was changed. March 2006, was the last \ntime he used Klonopin. (Tr. 61) \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was charged with Driving While Impaired by Alcohol \n(DWIA); DUI, and Driving While Under the Influence Per Se (DWI Per Se). He received \nprobation before judgment and paid a fine. The July 2006 incident was a violation of his \nprobation and because of it his probation was extended to July 2009. (Tr. 147) During \nprobation, he must stay drug and alcohol free and see his probation officer every four \nmonths. In November 2006, an interlock was installed on his vehicle, which he is \nrequired to keep on his vehicle until July 2009. (Tr. 121)  \n \nIn October 2006, he was again charged with DWIA. He was alone at home \ndrinking. He had 13 shots of whisky, which was not night of celebration, but an average \nnight. (Tr. 66) Applicant describes the evening as: \n \n. . . drinking alone in my place. I lost all my friends. I was fired from my \nband. Alone, every night with a bottle of whiskey, regularly sticking a \nshotgun in my mouth because I couldn\u2019t stand living like I was living \nanymore.  \n \nI had the shakes all day long. I would go out to my car at 5:00 in the \nafternoon, still stinking like a distillery, throw up and go get more whisky \nand do it again. I was in hell and now I\u2019m not. (Tr. 56-67)  \n \nHe ran out of cigarettes and went to the local gas station. On the way home, he \nfell asleep and had an accident. (Tr. 127) He received probation before judgment and \nsentenced to five weekends in jail. (Ex. 6) Applicant last drank alcohol on October 7, \n2006.    \n \n \nFrom July 2006 through January 2007, he received alcohol counseling twice a \nweek from a counseling service. (Tr. 101) He went to counseling on the advice of his \nattorney and doctor. The counseling consisted of watching videos and group discussion. \nApplicant stated he already knew he was a drunk. (Tr. 135) During counseling, \nApplicant was not ready to quite drinking. (Tr. 101) Applicant acknowledged he had \nmonths of alcohol abuse left. (Tr. 102) \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n \nApplicant credits Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) with saving his life. (Tr. 113) \nThrough AA, he found a way to stop drinking. (Tr. 113) He stated the 12 steps are a \npath to freedom. (Tr. 116) In 2006, Applicant started attending AA meetings. He \nattended 79 meetings in 90 days. (Tr. 114) For the first nine months of 2007, he was \nattending two or three meetings a week and attended two meetings a week during the \nlast three months. (Tr. 114) Applicant currently attends AA meetings twice a week. In \nOctober 2006, Applicant voluntarily went on Antabuse, which causes one severe \ndiscomfort when alcohol is ingested. (Tr. 111) Applicant\u2019s August 2008 urinalysis was \nnegative for alcohol and illegal drugs. (Ex. F)  \n \n \nFor six years, Applicant played drums in a band. In August 2006, the other band \nmembers kicked him out. The lead guitar player is a ten-year veteran of the county \npolice force. (Tr. 76) The officer said, at the time Applicant was kicked out of the band, \nApplicant was unreliable, had no stamina, looked sick, and was deteriorating physically. \nApplicant frequently failed to show up and when he did he was worthless. At band \npractice, Applicant was pathetic. (Tr. 71-72) Applicant continued to deteriorate, was \nmore and more tired, and less and less caring. (Tr. 83)  \n \n \nThe police officer has seen a marked change for the better in Applicant since \nApplicant stopped drinking. (Tr. 92) Applicant is a completely different person than he \nwas before. (Tr. 87) The officer now trusts Applicant. (Tr. 73) Applicant is a driven \nperson who is now the driving force in getting band bookings. (Tr. 74) When asked if the \nwitness would have testified if Applicant had not stopped drinking in October 2006, the \nwitness stated there would have been no need to testify. If Applicant had not stopped \ndrinking in 2006, the police officer believed the Applicant would not be alive for this \nhearing. (Tr. 75, 92)  \n \n \nIn June 2007, the band saw a change in Applicant and asked him to come back. \nApplicant stated he was not ready to come back and did not return until September \n2007. (Tr. 71) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, retired from the Secret Service, has seen a great change in his \nson since his son stopped drinking. Before, his son was really tense when around his \nfather, now his son is more relaxed, opens up more, and talks more on the telephone. \nThe difference in his son since he stopped drinking has been the difference between \nday and night. (Tr. 49) Prior to October 2006, his father was always waiting for a \ntelephone call reporting bad news such as a car accident, arrest, or death. His father is \nno longer worried about getting such a phone call and now gets a full night\u2019s sleep. (Tr. \n50) The change he has seen in his son has been a relief to him. (Tr. 59) His father now \nis more comfortable talking with his son. (Tr. 59)  \n \n \nApplicant finally \u201chit the wall\u201d in 2006. He realized he was at a point where he \nwould either live or die. He states he is a sober alcoholic who can not drink again. (Tr. \n151) He takes his alcoholism very seriously and guards against it every day. (Tr. 151) \nHe sees his current life as living instead of merely existing. His first year of sobriety was \nthe hardest. He \u201cwas hanging on with white knuckles and tears in\u201d his eyes. (Tr. 134) \n\n \n \n \n6\nHe is now where he should have been at age 24. (Tr. 152) He is using coping skills and \nis living life on life\u2019s terms. (Tr. 152) When drinking, Applicant could not stand living. He \nwas in hell, just miserable and now he is not. (Tr.128) He says life is beautiful and he \nwakes up feeling good. (Tr. 129, 133) Applicant states he lost two jobs when drinking \nand every relationship he ever had with women was ruined by alcohol. (Tr. 66, 117) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n7\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nApplicant had a serious drinking problem. He admits he is an alcoholic and \nalcohol dependent. He is also bipolar. His last few months of drinking were \u201cespecially \ndark\u201d and \u201cpretty brutal.\u201d He would sit at home drinking with a shotgun in his month \nwondering if he should pull the trigger. Frequently, he drank to intoxication, usually \ndrinking until he passed out. His alcohol use has caused adverse physical health effects \nto manifest. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical \npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an \nalcohol rehabilitation program; and, \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 (a) applies due to alcohol-related incidents away from work including: \nthe May 1991 DUI, the July 2006 DWI, and the October DWI. Under AG \u00b6 22 (b) there is \nno evidence Applicant ever reported to work intoxicated or was drinking on the job, but \nhe stated he lost two jobs because of his drinking. AG \u00b6 22 (c) applies due to his \nadmissions that before he quit drinking in October 2006, he was drinking four or five \ntimes a week to the point of intoxication. Normally, he would drink until he passed out. \nAG \u00b6 22 (d) applies because he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or \ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or \nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a \nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program. \n \nWhen Applicant was drinking, there was nothing infrequent about it. He was \ndrinking to the point of intoxication and passing out four or five times a week. Nor did it \noccur under unusual circumstances. As he stated, he was alone every night with a \nbottle of whiskey having the shakes all day long. He would go out to his car in the \nafternoon, throw up and go get more whisky and do it again. AG \u00b6 23 (a) does not \napply. \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant stopped drinking. It has been almost two years since \nhis last drink. There is no 100 per cent guarantee a person will not return to drinking no \nmatter how much time has passed since their last drink. Individuals sober for ten or \ntwenty years return to drinking. Time is but one indicator. A more significant indictor is \nApplicant\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the problem and his attitude toward \n\n \n \n \n9\naddressing the problem. AG \u00b6 23 (b) applies because Applicant has acknowledges his \nalcoholism, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence.  \n \nApplicant is an alcoholic and says, although a sober alcoholic, he will always be \nan alcoholic, not a former alcoholic or a former drinker. He realizes he can not drink \nagain. Before he finally \u201chit the wall,\u201d he was in hell, a dark and brutal place, frequently \ncontemplating suicide, and regularly sticking a shotgun in his mouth because he \ncouldn\u2019t stand living as he was. He realized he was at a point where he would either live \nor die. \n \nAlcoholics suffer from a high suicide rate and a significant adverse impact on \nmental health. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholism, especially anxiety and \ndepression disorders. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause panic disorders. In February \n2002, Applicant began seeing a doctor for his bipolar disorder. Applicant was suffering \nfrom depression, fear, paranoia, agitation, stress, and knew something was wrong \nbecause he was frequently crying. Applicant has responded to medication quickly, \nApplicant has been stable for years, and his bipolar disorder is in remission. \n \nApplicant\u2019s first year of sobriety was the hardest. He \u201cwas hanging on with white \nknuckles and tears in\u201d his eyes. He is now using coping skills and is living life on life\u2019s \nterms. Applicant credits Alcoholic Anonymous with saving his life. Through AA, he found \na way to stop drinking and sees the 12 steps is a path to freedom. Applicant currently \nattends AA meetings twice a week. Applicant takes his alcoholism very seriously and \nguards against it every day. He has significantly altered his life, going from hell and \nmisery to seeking life as beautiful, waking up feeling good, living life, not merely \nsurviving.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s significant life style change is evidence not only by Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and that of his father, but that of a 10-year veteran of the country police force. \nThe officer has seen a marked change for the better in Applicant since Applicant \nstopped drinking. He reported Applicant is a completely different person than he was \nbefore he stopped drinking. Applicant is now dependable, trustworthy, and physically in \nbetter shape. The officer believes had Applicant not stopped drinking in 2006, Applicant \nwould be dead by now.  \n \nFrom July 2006 through January 2007, he received alcohol counseling twice a \nweek from a counseling service. He has stopped drinking and is committed to \nmaintaining abstinence. AG \u00b6 23 (c) applies because he has attended counseling and \ntreatment and is making satisfactory progress. Since 2002, Applicant has been treated \nby his doctor for Bipolar and alcohol dependence, both of which, his doctor reports, are \nin remission. AG \u00b6 23 (d) applies because Applicant successfully completed treatment \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence.  \n \nI do not find it a security concern that Applicant has a proscription for Antabuse. \n \n\n \n \n \n10\n                                                          \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nUnder the state law, DUI, DWI, DWI \u2013 CDS, and similar offenses are not criminal \noffenses, but traffic offenses. Without evidence of a life-threatening injury, the offenses \nfall under the Transportation Article of the state code and not the criminal code. Since \nApplicant conduct was not criminal, I find for him as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, and \n2.e.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1990 through 1994 and again three times in \nJanuary 2003. AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying. AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201c \nand AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant saw his marijuana use as an attempt to self-medicate prior to seeking \npsychological help. Applicant was suffering from depression, fear, paranoia, agitation, \nand stress. Applicant\u2019s doctor reports Applicant responded to medication quickly, \nApplicant has been stable for years, and his bipolar disorder is in remission. Applicant \nhas no need to self-medicate in the future since his problems are responding well to his \ncurrent medication. Applicant has a good employment record, has expressed remorse, \nhas stopped drinking, and regularly attends AA. \n \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d4 \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s last use occurred more than five and a half years ago. AG \u00b6 32(a) \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. Applicant is a \nvaluable team member, in the top half of all analysts, and his supervisor rates him \nnumber two of the seven people he supervises. AG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d applies.  \n \n \nApplicant remains on probation for another ten months. Nothing in the Directive \nindicates that an applicant\u2019s current probationary status is a per se bar to a favorable \nsecurity decision. His probation cannot be simply disregard. See DISCR Case No. 90-\n1115 (October 6, 1992) at p.3. (\u201cIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s behavior since the 1988 \ncriminal charges, the Judge, as trier of fact, may properly note Applicant can be \nexpected to exhibit good behavior while on probation.\u201d) The marked change in \nApplicant\u2019s life and life style, his AA attendance, commitment, and sobriety are \nconsidered in determining that his remaining probation does not significantly undercut \nApplicant\u2019s claim of successful reform and rehabilitation.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 16 conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include AG \u00b6 16 (d) \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \n \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n \n12\ninformation.\u201d This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations.\u201d \nSince 1999, Applicant has had 10 speeding tickets and 10 additional tickets for \ntraffic violations. During the first six months of this year, Applicant has received three \nspeeding tickets. Receiving traffic tickets is inappropriate behavior, but as minor traffic \noffenses do not show Applicant to be untrustworthy or unreliable. I find for Applicant as \nto SOR \u00b6 2 a. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s life and attitude has \nundergone a great improvement since October 2006. He has changed from routinely \ndrinking to the point of passing out and contemplating suicide, to where he feels good \nwhen he wakes up. His life is in order.  \n \nApplicant is an alcoholic and will always be an alcoholic, but is now a sober \nalcoholic. His life has markedly improved from sitting home alone each night with a \nshotgun in his mouth wondering if he should pull the trigger because he could not stand \nliving life, to now, when he sees life as good and beautiful. He enjoys living life. \nApplicant was sincere, open, and honest at the hearing. It is clear he understands his \nalcohol problem. He has not tried to hide his past or shade the truth. He acknowledged \nhe was a drunk and an alcoholic. He told it as it is, and it was not a pretty picture. \nHowever, his involvement with AA, his understanding of his alcohol problem, his \ncommitment, and sobriety has vastly improved his life.  \n \n\n \n \n \n13\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3. a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on May 1, 2006. On March \n6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2008, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on April 21, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on May 12, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to me on May 14, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 2, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for June 18, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nM, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June \n27, 2008. The record closed on July 3, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request to take administrative notice of relevant \nfacts about Afghanistan (Tr. 42). The request to take administrative notice and the \nsupporting materials are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I also granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 3, 2008, to enable him \nto submit additional materials for administrative notice and to expand his request to \ninclude Pakistan (Tr. 42, 99-100). Department Counsel timely submitted HX II. I \ndeclined to accept two Congressional Research Service reports as a basis for \nadministrative notice. The reports are scholarly briefings of the issues, but there is no \nevidence that the conclusions of the authors were accepted by the U.S. government as \nnot subject to reasonable dispute. I admitted the documents, however as GX 4 and 5. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set forth below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d and 1.h. He partially admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g. His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor. He was \nborn in Afghanistan. He attended a university in Russia from 1982 to 1987, received a \nmaster\u2019s degree in television broadcasting, and then returned to Afghanistan. He fled to \nPakistan in 1989 to avoid the violence in Afghanistan, and he was granted asylum in the \nU.S. in 1990. He was the owner and operator of a coffee truck from January 1991 to \nMay 2004. He became a U.S. citizen in May 1998. In May 2004, he began his current \njob as a linguist. He held an interim clearance until November 2007, but he does not \nhave a final security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was deployed to Afghanistan and Pakistan in support of U.S. military \nforces from October 2004 to September 2006 (AX G and J), and April 2007 to \nNovember 2007, when his interim clearance was withdrawn (AX H and I). His direct \nsupervisor from June 2005 to June 2007 described his performance as \u201cexemplary.\u201d He \nconsidered Applicant to be one of the most reliable and trustworthy employees in the \ncompany. Applicant handled very sensitive information and was meticulous in \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmaintaining operational security. Military units needing support from linguists frequently \nrequested Applicant by name (AX A). He received several mementos and numerous \ncertificates of appreciation during his deployments (AX B, C, D, and M). \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s co-workers described him as a skilled, conscientious, and \ndedicated linguist. During one mission, he worked ten to fourteen-hour days seven days \na week for 78 days while living and working in austere conditions (AX E and F). During \nthe hearing, Applicant was unable to describe the missions he supported because they \nwere classified, but he testified he frequently rode in helicopters at night, and he \npresented evidence of an injury he suffered while rappelling from a helicopter (AX K; Tr. \n82-83). He testified he worked with U.S. troops, wore a military uniform, and sometimes \ncarried a weapon (Tr. 88). \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members knows he works with U.S. military forces. He \nhas told them he is working as an engineer. He lives in a small military compound while \ndeployed, but he is given a week\u2019s vacation away from the compound about every three \nmonths, during which he can stay in a hotel and visit his family (Tr. 80). When he visits \nhis family, he tells them he is working in Baghdad as an engineer for a short time and \nwill return to the U.S. He recognizes his family would be in danger if his involvement \nwith U.S. military forces was revealed. He has advised his family members to contact \nthe U.S. embassy or U.S. military forces if they are threatened, and to identify \nthemselves as having family in the U.S. (Tr. 84). He testified: \u201cIf they got killed from the \nTaliban, you know, I can\u2019t do nothing. I hope that does not happen to them.\u201d (Tr. 84.)  \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 1996 to a native of Afghanistan. The marriage took \nplace in Pakistan. His spouse became a U.S. citizen in May 2004. They have three \nchildren, ages 11, 8, and 4, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s spouse knows that \nhe travels overseas and works as a linguist, but she is unaware of his specific job, the \nplaces where he works, and that he works with U.S. military forces (Tr. 85, 89). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family fled to Pakistan in 1994. They returned to Afghanistan after \ncoalition forces ousted the Taliban from power. Applicant\u2019s father died in 1992, and one \nof his brothers was killed in 1994 (Tr. 63). His mother is a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan, and she lives with one of Applicant\u2019s sisters in the family home (Tr. 69). \nShe is unemployed, and she receives about $300 per month from Applicant. Applicant \nhas telephone contact with his mother about two times a month and twice a year in \nperson. \n \n \nApplicant has two living brothers. One is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan \nand is employed by the Afghan government (Tr. 74). The other brother lives in \nGermany, and Applicant believes he is a German citizen. He works as a truck driver and \nhas three sons and four daughters living in Afghanistan (Tr. 75). Applicant has email \ncontact with his brothers about twice a month. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. Both are \nteachers. Applicant has personal contact with one sister about twice a year, when he is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nin Afghanistan, and he has telephonic contact with his other sister two or three times a \nmonth. One sister\u2019s husband is deceased, and the other\u2019s husband owns a grocery \nstore (Tr. 70). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. His father-in-law is a government employee. His mother-in-law is a \nhousewife. Applicant has contact with his mother-in-law and father-in-law about once a \nmonth by telephone. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, and he works \nin a hotel. He has several sisters-in-law who live at home in Afghanistan and are not \nemployed outside the home (Tr. 73). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has an uncle living in Pakistan. Applicant regards her uncle \nas a friend and has visited him in Pakistan several times while on vacation from his \nofficial duties (Tr. 79-80). He has had no contact with her uncle since returning to the \nU.S. in November 2007 (Tr. 81). \n \n \nApplicant owns no property in Afghanistan or Pakistan. He purchased a home in \nthe U.S. in 2004 (Tr. 91).  \n \n \nAt the end of the hearing, Applicant expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to \nbe heard. He explained: \u201cI am so sad when I lost my clearance . . . . I was thinking \nnobody going to listen to me, no one going to bring me for a hearing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m \nhere, you know. I\u2019m so proud. United States is a great country and I love this country.\u201d \n(Tr. 92.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice that Afghanistan has been an independent \nnation since 1919, and it was a monarchy until a military coup in 1973. Following a \nsecond military coup in 1978, a Marxist government emerged. In December 1979, the \nSoviet Union invaded and occupied Afghanistan, but they were resisted by freedom \nfighters known as mujahidin. The Soviet Union withdrew in February 1989 pursuant to \nan agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, the U.S., and the Soviet Union. The \nmujahidin were not a part to the agreement and refused to abide by it. The result was a \ncivil war among several factions, including the Taliban. By the end of 1998, the Taliban \ncontrolled most of Afghanistan, committed atrocities against minority populations, and \nprovided sanctuary to Osama Ben-Laden, Al Qaida, and other terrorist organizations. \nU.S. military forces, along with forces from a coalition partnership, forced the Taliban \nout of power by November 2001. With the assistance and support of the U.S., a new \ndemocratic government took office in 2004. \n \n \nI also have taken administrative notice that Afghanistan\u2019s human rights record is \ngenerally poor, due to the continuing insurgency, the weak government, and ongoing \nrecovery efforts from two decades of war. Abuses include extrajudicial killing, torture, \nofficial impunity, and restrictions on individual rights. Killings by security forces, factional \nforces militias, terrorists and insurgents are a continuing problem. The weak \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngovernment and internal instability have enabled hostile states, non-state actors, \nterrorists, and insurgents to continue operating in Afghanistan, including groups hostile \nto the U.S. Although there is no evidence that Afghanistan conducts intelligence \noperations against the U.S., several terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as official government intelligence agencies.  \n \nThe U.S. has supported the emergence of a broad-based democratic \ngovernment and is assisting the Afghan people to rebuild their country and establish a \nrepresentative government that contributes to regional stability and respects human \nrights. In May 2005, the presidents of the two countries concluded a strategic \npartnership agreement committing both countries to a long-term relationship.  \n \nIn spite of efforts by the U.S. and the government of Afghanistan, it continues to \nbe a violent, unsafe, unstable country. Terrorists have targeted international non-\ngovernmental organizations, United Nations workers, and recipients of non-\ngovernmental assistance. Suicide bombing attacks continue to inflict large numbers of \ncasualties. \n \n \nFinally, I have taken administrative notice that Pakistan is a parliamentary federal \nrepublic with whom the U.S. has had diplomatic relations since 1947. Although Pakistan \nhas supported the U.S. campaign against terrorism, Many Al Qaeda and Taliban \nfugitives use the loosely-controlled border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan \nas a refuge. Extremist groups in Pakistan target American and other Western interests, \nsenior Pakistani officials, and members of minority indigenous and religious groups. \nPakistan has a poor human rights record, with a record of extrajudicial killings, torture \nand rape by security forces, lack of judicial independence, arbitrary arrest, wide-spread \ngovernment corruption, and the disappearance and imprisonment of political opponents.  \n \n \nA government document submitted by Department Counsel (GX 5) reflects U.S. \nconcern arising from Pakistan\u2019s transfer of weapons technology, including nuclear \ntechnology, to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Although I did not take administrative notice \nof this fact because of the nature of the source document, I find that the U.S. \ngovernment\u2019s concerns about Pakistan\u2019s weapons technology transfers are established \nby substantial evidence. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, one brother, mother-in-law, and \nfather-in-law are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, and that Applicant sends his \nmother about $300 per month (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c). It alleges Applicant\u2019s brother \nand father-in-law have positions in the Afghan government (SOR \u00b6 1.d and 1.e). It also \nalleges Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s uncle and grandmother are citizens of Afghanistan residing \nin Pakistan, and that Applicant visited his spouse\u2019s uncle at least three times (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.h). Applicant has pointed out that his spouse\u2019s mother-in-law, not her \ngrandmother, resides in Pakistan. Finally, the SOR alleges Applicant traveled to \nAfghanistan in March 2005, August 2005 through September 2005, January 2006 \nthrough May 2006, and April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f)  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \nA disqualifying condition under Guideline B may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). \nSecond, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). Applicant\u2019s relationships with family members in Afghanistan raise these two \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nA security concern also may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen and resident of the U.S., her immediate family \nmembers are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of \nthe person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted this presumption. He also has a friendly \nrelationship with his wife\u2019s uncle in Pakistan. I conclude AG \u00b6 7(d) is raised. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Afghanistan was either to perform his duties as a linguist or \nto visit his family members. Neither purpose has any independent security significance. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). Similarly, Applicant\u2019s financial \nsupport to his mother merely demonstrates his ties of affection and obligation to his \nmother, and it has no independent security significance. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Security concerns under this \nguideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign \npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of \nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant has \nclose and continuing contact with his family and his wife\u2019s family. Although the U.S. and \nAfghanistan are allies in the war on terrorism and the U.S. is committed to the \nestablishment of a free and independent government in Afghanistan, terrorists and \ninsurgents continue to threaten the government of Afghanistan, the interests of the U.S., \nand those who cooperate with the U.S. and the government of Afghanistan. Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrecognizes his work with the U.S. military forces endangers his family. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to his family is not \u201cminimal,\u201d but he has \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He has worked as a linguist for the U.S. since \nOctober 2004. He has been a U.S. citizen since 1998. His wife has been a U.S. citizen \nsince May 2004. He held an interim clearance until November 2007 without incident. He \nhas a reputation among his supervisors and colleagues for reliability, trustworthiness, \nand meticulous attention to operational security. He has put himself in harm\u2019s way often, \nworking alongside U.S. forces in numerous covert operations. He has made significant \ncontributions to national security, fully aware of the risks to himself and his family. He \nstrongly wants to return to his duties with U.S. troops. All these circumstances \ndemonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He was careful during \nthe hearing not to disclose sensitive or classified information about his experiences with \nthe U.S. military forces. He and his family have suffered under the Taliban, and \nApplicant sees the fight against terrorists, insurgents, and extremists as necessary to \n\n \n10 \n \n \nprotect the quality of life of his family members in Afghanistan. He has repeatedly \ndemonstrated his bravery, reliability, and trustworthiness. He has mentally and \nemotionally resolved the conflict between the safety of his family from terrorists and his \ndesire to help the U.S. military forces. He has repeatedly placed himself in harm\u2019s way \nto ensure that the terrorists will not prevail in the struggle for Afghanistan\u2019s future.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. In addition to my conclusion \nthat the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(b) is established, I also conclude that application \nof the whole person concept mitigates the security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s \nforeign family ties. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

DOHA received the \nrequest on December 24, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n27, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on February 17, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on February 18, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 5, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without objection. \nThe record closed upon adjournment of the hearing on March 5, 2009. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on March 23, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR and \noffered explanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor. \nHe works on avionics systems integration and flight control systems. He was born in \nSenegal and came to the U.S. in 1986 (Tr. 34). He was married to a native of Senegal \nin June 1991, and they have four children, ages 14, 11, 7, and 4 (GX 1 at 7). The oldest \nchild was born in Senegal, where he attends school. Their other three children reside \nwith them in the U.S. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in May 1996, and he has voted in \nevery national and local election since becoming a U.S. citizen (Tr. 42). His wife is a \npermanent resident alien (Tr. 39). He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant worked as a dishwasher and a line cook at several restaurants from \nSeptember 1995 to June 2001. He helped his spouse manage a hair braiding salon \nfrom July 2001 to March 2003, and he worked as a freelance translator from April 2003 \nuntil he was hired by his current employer in June 2005 (Tr. 35-36). \n \nApplicant received a degree in physics and chemistry while living in Senegal (Tr. \n7). He has attended college in the U.S. since November 1999, while working full-time. \nHe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in October 2002, a master\u2019s \ndegree in May 2005, and he is now in a doctoral program and expects to receive his \ndegree in December 2010. All of Applicant\u2019s education in the U.S. has been paid for \nfrom his own earnings and various U.S.-based grants and scholarships. After he came \nto the U.S. he received no educational or other benefits from the government of \nSenegal (Tr. 42). He has no property in Senegal (Tr. 43). Applicant testified he is \ngrateful for the opportunities the U.S. has given him, and he will do whatever is required \nto continue working in support of the U.S. (Tr. 52). \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s professors submitted letters on his behalf. One professor \ndescribed him as in the top one percent of the students, an \u201cunofficial faculty assistant,\u201d \nand highly respected because of his intelligence, motivation, enthusiasm, personable \nmanner, and involvement in class activities (AX B). He volunteers to help other students \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwho have difficulty keeping up with the pace of instruction (Tr. 28). Another professor \ndescribed him as a diligent and hard-working student, very respectful, and goal-oriented \n(AX C). A third professor evaluated him as a model student (AX D). One of Applicant\u2019s \nco-workers also submitted a letter on his behalf, describing him as a serious co-worker, \na team player, a person of high integrity, and very conscientious about following work \nprocedures (AX E).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He is the oldest child. He has three brothers \nwho are farmers, and two sisters and one half-sister who are housewives. All his \nsiblings live in a small village in Senegal and have never traveled outside Senegal (GX \n3 at 1-2). His siblings are uneducated, have no connection to the Senegalese \ngovernment, and they do not know he is being considered for a security clearance. (GX \n2 at 7; GX 3 at 2). \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Senegal for his father\u2019s funeral in September 1995 and for \nhis mother\u2019s funeral in April 1999. He visited his brothers and sisters in Senegal in 2003 \nand 2004. He obtained a Senegalese passport in December 2005 in order to avoid the \nharassment he experienced during his previous visits to Senegal using his U.S. \npassport. The passport had an expiration date of December 13, 2009, but he never \nused it, because he has not returned to Senegal since 2004.  \n \nApplicant testified he did not think having a Senegalese passport would raise any \nissues because he was advised by an immigration officer that he could keep his \nSenegalese citizenship so long as he used a U.S. passport to travel to and from the \nU.S. (Tr. 30). In an interview with a security investigator in June 2007, he told the \ninvestigator he was willing to renounce his Senegalese citizenship (GX 3 at 1). He \nsurrendered the Senegalese passport to his employer\u2019s security office when he realized \nit caused security concerns, and a member of the security office destroyed the passport \non February 24, 2009, by shredding it (AX A). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Senegal (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \nthat he renewed his Senegalese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \nand that he currently possesses a valid Senegalese passport that does not expire until \nDecember 13, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The concern under Guideline C is as follows: \u201cWhen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9.  \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). A disqualifying condition may \narise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign \npassport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant\u2019s possession of a valid Senegalese passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), shifting the burden to him to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). Security concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). Finally, security \nconcerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated if \u201cthe \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). All three mitigating conditions are established by the \nevidence in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a remarkable man. He emigrated from a small village in Senegal, \nworked at menial jobs for several years, obtained a responsible job with a defense \ncontractor, and distinguished himself as a college student while working full time. He is \nnow on the verge of obtaining a doctorate in electrical engineering. He obtained a \nSenegalese passport to avoid harassment when entering and leaving Senegal, but he \nhas never used it. He obtained it because he misunderstood the advice given by an \nimmigration official, and he surrendered it after learning it raised security concerns. In \nwords and in deeds, he has demonstrated his strong preference for the U.S.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn January 3, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated January 12, 2009, was provided to him by letter \ndated January 13, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA transmittal letter on \nJanuary 20, 2009. He was afforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He failed to submit any materials, \ncomments, or objections in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 24, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old copier operator and mailroom clerk working for a \ndefense contractor.3 He was born in the Philippines, and became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2002. He married his wife in 1995, and they have a 10-year-old son. He did \nnot serve in the U.S. military. He has worked for the same employer, a government \ncontractor, since February 2007.  \n \nHis work history is summarized as follows: from September 1997 to July 2006, \nhe was employed as a copier operator; he was unemployed from July 2006 to \nSeptember 2006; employed form September 2006 to January 2007 as an inkjet copier \noperator; and since February 2007, he has been consistently employed by a \ngovernment contractor as a copier operator/mailroom clerk (Item 5). Concerning his \n2006 three-month period of unemployment, Applicant explained he was unfairly \naccused of timesheet fraud and removed from his job. \n \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he had three foreclosed \nproperties and other financial problems. His background investigation addressed his \nfinancial problems, and included the review of December 2008 and July 2007 credit \nbureau reports (CBR). The SOR alleges 11 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling \napproximately $872,000. Apparently, $835,000 of the delinquent debt originated from \nApplicant\u2019s three repossessed real estate properties.  \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 5 (2007 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained his financial problems were the \nresult of him loosing his job, not finding a permanent job, and the adverse effects of the \nongoing world financial crisis. Because of the loss of income, he was forced to use his \ncredit cards to pay for his family\u2019s day-to-day living expenses. Later, he was unable to \nmake payments on his credit cards and other financial obligations. He initially used his \nsavings and withdrew his retirement funds to pay his debts, but ultimately these were \nnot sufficient and he stopped making payments. Applicant\u2019s 2007 CBR shows that prior \nto July 2007, he did not have a history of financial problems. \n \nApplicant purchased several real estate investment properties by taking an equity \nloan on his primary residence. He was unsuccessful selling the properties because of \nthe financial market turndown. His home and the investment properties were foreclosed. \nApplicant claimed he and his wife are in the process of working with each of his \ncreditors seeking the settlement or resolution of his debts. His goal is to be debt free. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$872,000. Applicant presented no evidence of efforts to pay or resolve his financial \nobligations. He claimed he and his wife were contacting creditors to resolve his \ndelinquent obligations. However, he presented no evidence, other than his statement, to \n \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsupport his claims. Considering the record evidence, I find that all of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts remain outstanding.  \n \nApplicant also stated he did not have the financial means to pay his legal \nobligations, delinquent debts, and his day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts; and, AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. His financial problems are ongoing and his evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence that established circumstances beyond his \ncontrol contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., he was unemployed for three \nmonths and the adverse effects of the global financial problems. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but \nonly partially. Applicant\u2019s sparse evidence is insufficient to show he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. It is not clear whether Applicant was fired from his job due to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhis own misconduct. He failed to document the adverse financial impact he suffered as \na result of his 2006 three month unemployment period.  \n \n \nMoreover, he failed to establish whether the number and extent of his real estate \ninvestments were reasonable in light of his income, financial stability, and overall \nfinancial practices. Other than his statement in his answer to the SOR, he presented no \nevidence of effort to contact creditors or to resolve his debts by entering into settlement \nagreements and payment plans. He has been consistently employed since July 2007. \nHe presented no corroborated evidence of efforts to resolve his delinquent debts from \n2007 to the day he received the FORM. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, there are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. His inability to pay his debts \nshows he was financially overextended. Considering the totality of the circumstances, \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements fail to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. He also failed to present any evidence that he received financial counseling, and \nthat his financial problems are not likely to recur. The remaining mitigating conditions \nare not reasonably raised by the facts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant seems to be a mature, \nwell trained man, and a good father and husband. He has been successful working for a \ndefense contractor since 2007. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that he \nis not a good, reliable and competent worker. These factors show some responsibility \nand mitigation. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant failed to establish that he is financially responsible, \nthat he is not financially overextended and that he displays good judgment. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations. Overall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department on September 1, 2006. \n \nOn January 6, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. He\nadmitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a through 1.h. DOHA assigned the case to\nme on February 2, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 22, 2010, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 30, 2010.  Department Counsel offered\nsix exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of four witnesses. He\noffered 16 exhibits, which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-P. At Applicant\u2019s\nrequest I kept the record open until April 16, 2010. Applicant submitted an additional 16\nApril 30, 2010\n\n2\ndocuments, received into the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) on April 6, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduating\nfrom high school in 1992, he attended some college classes. Applicant has been\nemployed with various contractors. He is engaged and has two children. He has been\nwith his current employer since April 2006. (GE 1.) Applicant has held an interim\nsecurity clearance since approximately 2006. (Tr.91.)\nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e bought a home in October 2004. The mortgage rate\nwas variable. They had a son in April 2005. (Tr. 40.) In July 2005, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\nlost her job. She was unemployed for almost one year. Applicant could not maintain his\nmonthly expenses, including his car payment or mortgage. The vehicle was\nrepossessed and his wages were garnished. His reduced income was the only income\nfor his family. He accumulated more delinquent debt. This was the beginning of his\nfinancial difficulties.\nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e had some delinquent debt. She was making payments on her\ndebts which did not leave any money for other debt. They share joint accounts.\nApplicant acknowledged that he was somewhat overextended when he bought the\nhome. (Tr. 105.) In the past several years, Applicant made partial payments on his\nmortgage account. (Tr. 159) He used a tax refund to pay the initial amount ($4,500)\nneeded to complete a loan modification in January 2010. (AE F) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $28,000. (GE 6).\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is described below.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($4,907) is charged off credit card account. The\noriginal account was sold to a law firm. Applicant was paying $150 a month on the\naccount since the summer of 2009. The current balance is approximately $1,437. In\nJanuary 2010, the firm filed for bankruptcy and Applicant was unable to send his regular\nmonthly payment. (Tr. 19; AE A) He researched the account and is now making\npayments to a new firm in the amount of $160. (AE 15, 16.)\n1.b ($2,339) is a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 23.)\n1.c ($2,937) is a credit card collection account. Applicant has made monthly $50\npayments on the account since June 2009. He made payments of $100 a month for the\npast two months due to checks being returned for the debt in 1.a. (Tr. 26; AE B.)\n1.d ($495) is a collection account that was paid in full. (AE C.)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.e ($746) was settled for $112. (AE D.)\n\n3\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 f $501 is a charged-off credit card account. The\naccount is paid. (AE E.)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was 120 days past due for $24,944 on his second\nmortgage. Applicant contacted the company and modified the loan. (AE F.) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h  $14,182 on his past due mortgage. This has been\nconsolidated with the mortgage. (Tr. 111.) He is now current on the payment. (AE G.)\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $6,168, which includes his\nfiance\u2019s income. He received a raise in March 2010. After expenses, his net monthly\nremainder is $739. This amount will increase to $1,468 in August due to a lower second\nmortgage payment that will begin in August. Applicant has no credit cards. He has no\ncar payment. (Tr.47.) He has a household budget. His recent credit reports confirm that\nhe pays as agrees on his accounts. Applicant\u2019s fiancee will receive more income after\nher graduation from nursing school. They do not take extravagant vacations.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor described Applicant as a dependable employee who takes\non additional tasks whenever possible. (Tr. 130.) Applicant performs his job in an\noutstanding manner. He works overtime whenever possible. He has had no problems at\nwork.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, a retired Air Force Colonel,  testified that he has known\nApplicant for about 19 years. Applicant was a friend of his son\u2019s and he visited his family\nfrequently. (Tr. 139.) He recommends Applicant for a security clearance. He is fully\naware of the financial issues at hand. He also emphasized that the mortgage problem\nwas in part due to the general economic downturn.\nApplicant\u2019s father, who has held a security clearance for almost 45 years,\ndescribed his son as a person who does not gamble or have difficulty with alcohol.\nApplicant has received financial advice from his father in the past. Applicant is a\nresponsible individual and has learned from his circumstances. (Tr. 152.) Applicant\u2019s\nfather has not given his son any financial assistance in the past year. \nApplicant submitted three letters of recommendation. He is praised as a\ntrustworthy, dependable, and honest person. Applicant is a dedicated family man. He\nworks hard to provide for his family. (AE O.)  Applicant is recommended for a security\nclearance based on his loyalty to his company and to his family. (AE P.)\nApplicant received an award in May 2008 for his work with the Army. (AE N.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\n\n4\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\n \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on various accounts. He\nadmitted that he had delinquent debt in the amount of $28,000. His credit reports\nconfirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties began in 2005 and continue to the present. This mitigating condition\ndoes not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@ Applicant and his fiancee bought a home in 2004. The\nmortgage had a variable rate. In April 2005, they had a child. Later in 2005, Applicant\u2019s\nfiancee lost her job. Applicant could not maintain the monthly expenses on his income.\nThe mortgage rate increased and they fell behind in their mortgage. They made partial\npayments on the mortgage each month. Applicant managed a loan modification in 2010.\nHe paid on several other accounts. He acted responsibly under the circumstances. This\nmitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He\n\n6\nattempted to pay on his accounts whenever he could. He has made payments since\n2009. He is now on a sound path with his mortgage. His efforts are sufficient to carry his\nburden on those debts. I conclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant produced documentation to\nsubstantiate the duplication of an account. This mitigating condition applies.  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nApplicant is an honest, hard-working individual. He has been employed with his\ncurrent employer for six years and has held an interim security clearance with no\nproblems. He has favorable recommendations from his employer. He has received\nraises during his employment. His fiancee will be increasing her salary when she\nfinishes nursing school. He is current on his monthly expenses. He now has the skills to\nkeep abreast of his finances. He is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he\npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that he has a plan\nto resolve his financial problems and has taken significant action to implement the plan.\nHe has a loan consolidation for the home mortgage and the second mortgage. The\nentirety of his financial situation and his actions can reasonably be considered in\nevaluating the extent to which his plan to reduce his outstanding indebtedness is\n\n7\ncredible and realistic. Available, reliable information about a person\u2019s behavior, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\nApplicant presented sufficient information to show that he has paid most of his\ndebts, and has a plan to resolve the remaining delinquent debt. He established that he\nis financially more aware. He is taking consistent, reasonable, and responsible action to\nresolve his financial issues and become a better financial manager. He has consistent\npay. He has the means and the ability to resolve his delinquent debts. His monthly net\nremainder will increase in August 2010. He now has a mortgage with a fixed rate.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Stevens, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has 14 unpaid debts totaling approximately $14,000, which are in \ncollection or have been charged off. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on April 16, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations.  \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n 1\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n  \n \nOn April 16, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated November 5, 2008. The FORM contained 10 \nattachments. On November 18, 2008, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along \nwith notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nApplicant's response to the FORM was due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due on December 18, 2008. As of January 15, 2009, no \nresponse had been received. On January 16, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.d and \u00b6 \n1.o of the SOR. He also denied SOR \u00b6 1. He admitted the remaining factual allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old purchasing agent who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since August 2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and was on disability for six \nmonths. In June 2005, Applicant suffered a stroke and a brain aneurism and was out of \nwork from June 2005 through September 2005. From October 2005 through December \n2005, he worked part-time until January 2006 when he returned to full-time \nemployment. His part-time employment and large medical bills added to his financial \nproblems. (Item 6, p 5) In July 2005, Applicant\u2019s automobile was repossessed. \nFollowing resale of the vehicle, he yet owed $3,770 on the vehicle. \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant stated he was working with a financial adviser to \naddress his debts. (Item 6, p 2) At that time, he intended to start making monthly \npayments on his debts. He attached a repayment schedule indicating he would pay \n$150 each month on a $1,415 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) owed a towing company. Applicant \nsubmitted a proposed repayment plan with his answers to the written interrogatory. \n(Item 6, p 9) No evidence documenting payment of the listed debts was provided.  \n \n \nAs of August 2007, Applicant\u2019s monthly gross income was $3,826 and his net \nincome was approximately $3,000. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s gross monthly income was \n$3,000 and her net income was $2,121. After paying monthly expenses, their combined \nmonthly disposable income was $2,461. (Item 6, p 7) As of February 2008, their \ncombined monthly disposable income was $1,269 (Item 6, p 8)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 debts, which total $14,421. Applicant denies two debts \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d and SOR \u00b6 1.o), which total approximately $5,000. He admits the remaining \n13 debts. Six of the debts were for small amounts under $300 each: a $37 medical debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $28 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a $100 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k), $142 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), a $158 telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and a $252 telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.m). \nThe other seven debts were: a $372 medical bill (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $1,875 collection account \n 2\n\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f), $3,770 collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.h), $323 collection account (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i), a $551 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j), a $1,415 debt owed an automobile towing \ncompany (SOR \u00b6 1.l), and a $476 gas utility bill (SOR \u00b6 1.n). \n \n \nApplicant denied the $318 debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.d), which was a cell phone account \nclosed in 2004. Applicant asserted he thought he had a zero balance when he closed \nthe account. (Item 6, p 5) As of March 2008, Applicant owed $317 on this debt. (Item 7) \nApplicant paid two accounts, the cell phone debt and a $10 co-payment on a dental bill. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2008 credit bureau report, lists the cell phone debt as paid. (Item \n10)  \n \n \nApplicant denied the $4,604 debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.o) Applicant offered no further \nexplanation or information as to the nature of this debt. The debt appears on Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2008 credit bureau report, (Item 6, p 17) but does not appear on his \nNovember 2008 credit bureau report. (Item 10) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n 3\n\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has 14 past due unpaid debts totaling approximately $14,000, \nwhich are in collection or have been charged off. Six of Applicant\u2019s debts were under \n$300 each. The evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under Financial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n 4\n\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his \ninterview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR \nresponse, and his response to interrogatories. Applicant has admitted responsibility for \nall but two of his delinquent debts. He has provided insufficient documentation to show \nsignificant progress resolving any of his debts other than the $318 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nThere is no documentation that even the six smallest debts which together total \napproximately $700 have been paid.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His \nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and did not occur under circumstances \nnot likely to recur. He failed to demonstrate that his debts were largely due to \ncircumstances beyond his control, or that he has acted responsibly in addressing his \ndebts. Further, he has not sought credit counseling, or otherwise brought the problem \nunder control as his circumstances permitted.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. There are 14 unpaid debts. Some of the debts are \nmedical debts, others are for utility bills, and one is owed to an automobile towing \ncompany, which are not unusual debts and are the type of debts likely to recur in the \nfuture. The debts cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \n 5\n\nAG & 20(b) has limited applicability. Applicant=s financial problems were \ncontributed to by his 1999 auto accident for which he was on disability for six months \nand a 2005 stroke, which resulted in him being out of work for four months and three \nmonths part-time working ending in January 2006. Other than the medical bills, \nApplicant has provided no evidence as to how these events impacted on finances. The \nfive unpaid medical debts total approximately $1,100. There is no documentation that \neven the two smallest of these medical debts ($28 and $37) have been paid.  \n \nThere is no showing Applicant has received financial counseling or that his debts \nare being resolved or are under control. Only one debt has been paid. There is no \nrepayment plan. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although the debts are not the type \nthat indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. The money was not spent frivolously, nor incurred on luxuries; however, the \ndebts remain unpaid.  \n \nBased on the totality of the evidence available in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nHe has not taken effective action to resolve his debts, and has not equipped himself to \navoid financial problems in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n 6\n\n 7\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a - c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e - o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended college for a period but did not earn a degree. He is married with three children, ages seven, three, and one.1 Applicant had steady employment with a company from about 1994 through December 2003, when he was laid off. He then went through a period of unemployment, underemployment, and low-paying jobs. He started working for a defense contractor in September 2006. He has continued to work for that company or a successor contractor since then. Applicant is now earning about the same as he earned when he was laid off his job in 2003. His wife earns slightly more than him.2 The SOR alleges 16 debts totaling approximately $37,072. Applicant admitted owing all the debts in the SOR. Applicant has not made any payments on any of the debts. He attributed his financial difficulties to his employment problems.3 Applicant stated that he intends to pay his delinquent debts. He participated in a repayment program for about six months between about May 2005 and February 2006, but was unable to maintain the payments and discontinued the program. He consulted the same credit counseling company about three weeks before the hearing. They have arrived at an estimated monthly payment plan of $662 per month.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 15, 2008. The answer did not \nstate whether Applicant wanted a hearing or to have the case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel clarified the issue with Applicant and \ndetermined that he wanted a hearing. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nExhibit (HE) II. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on August 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 17, 2008. \nOn September 8, 2008, Applicant sent via facsimile a request to reschedule the time of \nthe hearing to later in the day. The request is marked HE I. On September 11, 2008, the \nhearing was cancelled because of the threat of severe weather. Another notice of \nhearing was issued on September 25, 2008.

He is married with three children, ages seven, \nthree, and one.1  \n \n \nApplicant had steady employment with a company from about 1994 through \nDecember 2003, when he was laid off. He then went through a period of unemployment, \nunderemployment, and low-paying jobs. He started working for a defense contractor in \nSeptember 2006. He has continued to work for that company or a successor contractor \nsince then. Applicant is now earning about the same as he earned when he was laid off \nhis job in 2003. His wife earns slightly more than him.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 16 debts totaling approximately $37,072. Applicant admitted \nowing all the debts in the SOR. Applicant has not made any payments on any of the \ndebts. He attributed his financial difficulties to his employment problems.3 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he intends to pay his delinquent debts. He participated in a \nrepayment program for about six months between about May 2005 and February 2006, \nbut was unable to maintain the payments and discontinued the program. He consulted \nthe same credit counseling company about three weeks before the hearing. They have \narrived at an estimated monthly payment plan of $662 per month. He had not entered \ninto a contract with the company as of the date of the hearing, but had a meeting with \nthe company scheduled for October 23, 2008.4 \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 16; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 15-23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 14-17; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 23-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \n  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not applicable. He attributed his financial problems to unemployment, \nunderemployment, and low-paying jobs after being laid off a good job in 2003. These \nare conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has \nnot made any effort to pay any of his delinquent debts since February 2006, even \nthough he has had steady employment since September 2006. There is insufficient \ninformation for a finding that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant has received some financial counseling under his debt repayment \nprogram in 2005 and 2006, and he intends on re-enrolling in the program. He has not \nmade any payments on his delinquent debts in more than two years. There are not clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially \napplicable. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant lost a good paying job in \n2003. He worked low-paying jobs for several years until he started working for a \ndefense contractor in about September 2006. He states that he intends to pay his \ndelinquent debts and that he will start a repayment program. That is a promising start, \nbut he has done virtually nothing since September 2006 to address his delinquent \ndebts. His finances remain a security concern. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Guideline B - Foreign Influence The Applicant was born in the PRC, but came to the U.S. in 1998 (TR at page 16 line 25 to page 24 line 13). Her mother \u201cwas born in a wealthy family and was well educated\u201d (TR at page 14 lines 7~20). However, when the Communist came to power, and after the Cultural Revolution, her mother was assigned to perform menial tasks for the rest of her working years (Id). As a result, the Applicant has no love for the PRC (TR at page 16 line 25 to page 24 line 13, and at page 33 line 20 to page 36 line 6). She was naturalized as an American citizen in 2006, and is married to a former U.S. Navy Petty Officer (TR at page 16 line 25 to page 24 line 13, and at page 41 line 6 to page 43 line 10). 1.a.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on January 3, 2007.  On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 17, 2008.  She answered\nthe SOR in writing on June 30, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on July 24, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment that same day.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 4, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 21, 2008.  The Government offered\nExhibits (EXs) 1 and 2, which were stipulated to.  Applicant testified on her own behalf,\nOctober 10, 2008\n\n2\nas did her husband.  She also submitted Exhibit A, which was admitted without\nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on September 3, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  This request was\ngranted.  The request, and the attached documents, were not admitted into evidence,\nbut were included in the record.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, and 1.c of the SOR, with explanations.  She also provided additional information to\nsupport her request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant was born in the PRC, but came to the U.S. in 1998 (TR at page 16\nline 25 to page 24 line 13).  Her mother \u201cwas born in a wealthy family and was well\neducated\u201d (TR at page 14 lines 7~20).  However, when the Communist came to power,\nand after the Cultural Revolution, her mother was assigned to perform menial tasks for\nthe rest of her working years (Id).  As a result, the Applicant has no love for the PRC\n(TR at page 16 line 25 to page 24 line 13, and at page 33 line 20 to page 36 line 6).\nShe was naturalized as an American citizen in 2006, and is married to a former\nU.S. Navy Petty Officer (TR at page 16 line 25 to page 24 line 13, and at page 41 line 6\nto page 43 line 10).\n1.a.  As mentioned above, the Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of the\nPRC (TR at page 24 line 14 to page 25 line 4).  She is 79 years of age, of fragile health,\nand lives with Applicant\u2019s brother (Id, and TR at page 25 line 13 to page 28 line 2).  Her\nmother gets no government pension, never worked for PRC\u2019s government, and was\nnever a member of the Communist Party (Id).  The Applicant sends her mother between\n$1,000~$2,000, a couple of times a year during Chinese holidays (TR at page 25 line 13\nto page 28 line 2).  She also speaks to her mother once a month, but her mother does\nnot know who Applicant works for, only that the Applicant is an engineer (Id).\n1.b.  Applicant\u2019s younger brother is also is a citizen and resident of the PRC (TR\nat page 28 line 3 to page 30 line 12).  He works as a technician in a fertilizer plant (Id).\nShe rarely speaks to her brother at any length, she calls his home and he passes the\n\n3\nphone to their mother (TR at page 28 line 3 to page 30 line 12).  He does not work for\nPRC\u2019s government, and is not a member of the Communist Party (Id).  He does not\nknow who the Applicant\u2019s employer is (TR at page 28 line 3 to page 30 line 12).\nThe Applicant\u2019s oldest sister is a retired accountant (TR at page 30 line 13 to\npage 32 line 7).  She only speaks to this sister a couple of times a year (Id).  Her sister\ndid not work for PRC\u2019s government, and is not a member of the Communist Party (TR at\npage 30 line 13 to page 32 line 7).  She does not know the Applicant\u2019s employer is a\ndense contractor (Id).\nThe Applicant\u2019s other sister owns a \u201cfacial shop\u201d (TR at page 32 line 8 to page 33\nline 19).  She speaks to this sister about \u201conce a month\u201d about facial beauty advice (Id,\nand TR at page 15 lines 2~22).  Like the Applicant\u2019s other siblings, this sister does not\nwork for PRC\u2019s government, and is not a member of the Communist Party (Id).  She\ndoes not know who the Applicant\u2019s employer is (TR at page 28 line 3 to page 30 line\n12).\nThe Applicant is not be subject to coercion by the PRC vis-a-vis her Chinese\nfamily members (TR at page 16 line 9~15).  She \u201cwould seek assistance from the\nproper authorities . . . of the United States\u201d (Id).\n1.c.  The Applicant traveled to the PRC in 2003 and in 2004 to visit her parents\nand to tour the country (TR at page 15 line 23 to page 16 line 8, at page 25 lines 5~12,\nand at page 36 line 7 to page 39 line 3).  She last visited the PRC in 2007 to bury her\nfather (Id).  She has no current plans to visit the PRC (TR at page 36 line 7 to page 39\nline 3).\nI also take administrative notice of the following facts: The PRC, the most\npopulous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an important trading\npartner of the U.S.  It is run by the Communist Party which controls all aspects of the\nPRC government.  It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.  Although\nthere has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the U.S.\nThe PRC has an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings;\ndetention or incarceration without notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest,\ndetention or exile; no right to a public, fair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of\ndue process; restrictions on free speech, on religious freedom, freedom to travel, on\nfreedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family, home or correspondence.\nThe PRC engages in espionage against the U.S. through an extensive network\nof businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S.\nmilitary technology.  It tries to identify ethnic Chinese in the U.S. who have access to\nsensitive information, and sometimes enlist their cooperation in illegal technology\ninformation transfers.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother and two sisters are citizens of and reside in the PRC.  This\nis clearly countered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . . .\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The\nApplicant has no love for the PRC.  The Cultural Revolution decimated her family.  Her\nfamily knows little of what she does, only that she is an engineer.  She can not be\ncoerced by the PRC or any other government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nShe has the unqualified support of her past and present supervisors, and of her\ncolleagues (AppX A at pages 1~4).  Her current supervisor avers, in part, the following:\nIn the years that . . . [the Applicant] has been a direct report to me, she\nhas shown herself to be a diligent, organized, and hard-working.  She has\nshown herself to be diligent, organized, and hard working.  She has\ndemonstrated dedication to both our company, and to the programs that\nwe participate in. . . . [The Applicant] is extremely cognizant of the\n\n6\nimportance of upholding our National security, and as such treats all\nmaterial, whether classified, proprietary, or otherwise, with proper respect\n(AppX A at page 2).\nI have considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR, dated July 26, 2008, admitted both SOR allegations and\nrequested a decision based on the written record without a hearing. \n  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 20,\n2008, that was received by Applicant on August 28, 2008. Applicant submitted a response\nto the FORM, dated September 17, consisting of a cover letter with five attachments.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nOctober 7, 2008\n\n2\nThose documents were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-6, and made part of the\nrecord without objection.  The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old man who has been employed as an electrical engineer\nby a defense contractor since July 1991. He has held a security clearance since about\nFebruary 1996. He attended graduate school from January 1999 to December 2001, but\ndid not complete the course work for award of the masters degree in English he had been\npursuing. He submitted letters of recommendation from a co-worker, a friend and a\nminister attesting to his reputation as a patriotic, dependable, honest and trustworthy\nindividual.\nApplicant was married in June 1990. That marriage ended in divorce in October\n1993. He has been remarried since October 2005. He has one child who was born in\nOctober 2007.\nApplicant used marijuana on approximately four occasions between March and July\n2006. Each use occurred while he was attending social functions at the homes of his wife\u2019s\nfriends and consisted of his taking a couple of \u201chits\u201d from a cigarette or pipe that was being\npassed around. He stopped using marijuana in July 2006 because he did not like it and it\nhad little to no effect on him. Applicant\u2019s wife used marijuana on a fairly regular basis at the\ntime, but  she stopped using marijuana sometime between July and September 2006\nbecause they wanted to start a family. \nApplicant and his wife have changed residences since they last used marijuana and\nno longer remain in close contact with the persons with whom they previously shared\nmarijuana. They have determined their household will remain drug free and they are\ndetermined to set a good example for their child. Applicant executed an affidavit entitled:\nStatement of Intent with Automatic Revocation of Clearance for any Violation on\nSeptember 17, 2008. (AE 1) In it, he has agreed to submit to random drug testing and to\nan automatic revocation of his clearance for any violation of any policy contained in the\nDirective. \nApplicant also used a prescription drug that had not been prescribed for him on at\nleast six occasions between June 2005 and April 2006. In 2005, Applicant told his wife\u2019s\nsister-in-law that he had been experiencing chest pains as a result of stress at work and\nplanning for his upcoming marriage. The sister-in-law provided him the unused tablets of\na prescription medicine that had been prescribed for her for similar symptoms. He used the\nlast of those pills in April 2006, and then saw his own physician who prescribed a different\nanti-stress medication for him. He took the medication that was prescribed for him for\nabout a month but has been undergoing chiropractic therapy since. He asserts his change\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v.

Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline H (drug involvement),\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant used marijuana approximately four times and a prescription drug that had\nnot been prescribed for him about six times in 2005-06. He possessed a security clearance\nat all times while abusing these drugs. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 25(a): any drug\nabuse; and DC 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance apply.\nThe last time Applicant misused either drug was July 2006. There is nothing in the\nrecord to suggest he ever misused a controlled substance before or after the relatively brief\nperiod between June 2005 and July 2006. His use of marijuana was situational in that it\noccurred at social events he attended with his then new wife. It ended after a few\nexperiments with the drug that he found he disliked and which had little to no effect on him.\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of the prescription drug was likewise situational. The misused drug was\nreplaced by properly prescribed medication and all pain/stress medication used by\nApplicant has now been replaced by chiropractic care.\nSince Applicant misused the two controlled substances, he has become a father,\nhe has averred his household will be drug free, he and his wife have determined they will\nnot misuse controlled substances in the future, and he and his wife have minimal contact\nwith the persons with whom they shared drugs in the past. It is extremely troubling that\nApplicant misused controlled substances while in possession of a security clearance.\nHowever, and to his credit, he freely disclosed the abuse in the e-QIP he submitted and\nduring his follow-up interview and in his responses to the SOR and the FORM. \nConsidering the situational circumstances when and under which Applicant used\nmarijuana and the prescription drug, the relatively short  time period during which he used\nboth drugs, the changes in his life since his last misuse of a controlled substance, including\nfatherhood, his minimal continuing contacts with the persons with whom he and his wife\nshared marijuana, and his commitment to and apparent relief from chiropractic care as a\n\n5\nsubstitute for any medication, his and his wife\u2019s unequivocal assertion to remain drug free\nin the future, and his execution of the document entitled: Statement of Intent with\nAutomatic Revocation of Clearance for any Violation, I find Mitigating Conditions (MC)\n26(a): the behavior happened so long ago . . . or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence;(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance\nfor any violation apply.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, to include Applicant\u2019s letters of recommendation, his lengthy\nemployment with a defense contractor, the number of years he has held a security\nclearance without any other reported violations, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6\nof the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has\nmitigated the security concern caused by his drug involvement. He has overcome the case\nagainst him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline H is decided for\nApplicant. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Borgstrom,  Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Louis B. Cappuccio, Jr., Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on June 28, 2005.\nOn August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline H and Guideline E that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a\nsecurity clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 15, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 20,\n2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\nMarch 9, 2009\n\nTo date the notice that was mailed to Applicant\u2019s counsel had not been returned to DOHA by the U.S.\n1\nPostal Service.\n2\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On November 21, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nDecember 17, 2008. On or about December 15, 2008, I was informed that counsel for\nApplicant had not received the notice  but that he and Applicant could be available on\n1\nDecember 19, 2008. On December 15, 2008, I issued an amended notice rescheduling\nthe hearing for December 19, 2008.\nAt the hearing, Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement set forth in E3.1.8\nof the Directive. Nine government exhibits (Ex. 1-9) were admitted without any\nobjections, and Applicant was called as an adverse witness, having declined to offer\ntestimony in his behalf. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 31,\n2008. I held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit\ndocumentation. By first class mail on December 30, 2008, Applicant forwarded through\nhis counsel a statement to which Department Counsel did not object. The document\nwas admitted as Exhibit A. Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) that Applicant used cocaine\nwith varying frequency from about 1980 to at least October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he\nwas placed in a diversion program following his arrest for illegal possession of cocaine\nin October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he used cocaine while holding a security clearance\ngranted in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he used marijuana from at least 1975 to 1981 (SOR \u00b6\n1.d); and that he pleaded nolo contendere to a 1981 possession of marijuana charge\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) Applicant was alleged to have\nfalsified a 1994 National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) by indicating that he had tried\nmarijuana a couple of times in 1975 and had not used the drug since (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that\nhe had falsified a February 2, 1995, sworn statement by denying any illegal drug use\nother than marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and that he falsified a June 2005 SF 86 by denying\nany illegal drug use in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.c) and any illegal drug use ever\nwhile possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.d). The use of cocaine while holding a\nsecurity clearance was also cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.e).\nApplicant denied the allegations with the exception of his arrest for cocaine\npossession in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and the use of cocaine while holding a\nclearance (SOR \u00b6 2.e), which he asserted happened once. After considering the\npleadings and the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old material technical aide who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since December 1989. He currently possesses a secret-level\nsecurity clearance that was granted to him in October 2001. He and his ex-wife divorced\nin November 2001 after 22 years of marriage. They had three children together, the\nyoungest of which is now 17. (Exs. 1, 2)\n\n3\nApplicant smoked marijuana on average twice a month when it was passed to\nhim at parties from about 1975 to 1981 (Ex. 6). In September 1981, he was arrested for\npossession of marijuana. Heading to the beach with a friend, he had pulled over to he\nside of the road and was rolling a marijuana cigarette when an officer approached and\narrested him. He pleaded nolo contendere, and the charge was filed for one year with\ncosts (Exs. 7, 8). Applicant has also used cocaine. Following his initial experimentation\nin 1980, he snorted the drug once every two to three years to at least 2003 (Ex. 4).\nIn December 1989, Applicant began working for his present employer, and he\nwas issued a company-granted confidential clearance. Needing a Department of\nDefense confidential security clearance for his duties, Applicant completed a NAQ on\nJune 2, 1994. He listed October 1975 larceny and October 1981 driving while\nintoxicated charges to which he had pleaded nolo contendere, as well as a July 1983\ndisorderly conduct charge for which he was fined. He did not include his arrest for\nmarijuana possession. In response to question 20.a (\u201cHave you ever tried or used or\npossessed any narcotic (to include heroin or cocaine), depressant (to include\nguaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include\nmarijuana or hashish), or any mind altering substance (to include glue or paint), even\none time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d),\nApplicant indicated, \u201cMARIJUANA TRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES IN 1975, DIDN\u2019T LIKE\nIT, NO USE SINCE, NO FUTURE INTENT.\u201d (Ex. 3). Applicant did not disclose his use\nof cocaine on his NAQ because he was scared he would not obtain his clearance if he\ndid so (Tr. 63). \nOn February 2, 1995, Applicant was interviewed by a senior special agent with\nthe Defense Investigative Service (DIS) about his arrests and illegal drug involvement.\nApplicant acknowledged his September 1981 arrest for possession of marijuana.\nApplicant related that he had not reported this arrest on his NAQ because it did not\nappear on the copy of his arrest record that he obtained from the local police.\nConcerning his use of illegal drugs, Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana\nabout 1975 to 1981. He denied any intent to use marijuana in the future or any\ninvolvement with other illegal drugs. Applicant explained that he did not disclose the full\nextent of his marijuana use on his NAQ because he did not feel that the secretary who\nassisted him with the form should know the particulars of his use. He knew he would\nhave an interview with the DIS and intended to disclose his actual use at that time. (Ex.\n6). Applicant was granted a Department of Defense confidential clearance shortly\nthereafter, in March 1995 (Exs. 1, 2).\nIn October 2001, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was upgraded to secret (Exs. 1,\n2). For a periodic reinvestigation for that clearance, Applicant executed a security\nclearance application (SF 86) on June 28, 2005. In response to question 24 concerning\nwhether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol\nor drugs, Applicant listed a March 2000 DWI for which he was placed on probation for\none year. He responded \u201cNO\u201d to questions 27 (\u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7\nyears, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for\nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine,\n\n4\ncodeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,\ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d) and 28\n(\u201cHave you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law\nenforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security\nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public safety?\u201d). (Ex.\n1)\nIn mid-October 2006, the state police had a local business under surveillance for\nalleged illegal gambling activities. They observed an individual exit the business\ncarrying a partially concealed brown paper bag. Detectives pulled this person over for a\nmotor vehicle violation and they found wagering slips, betting guides, and ledgers, as\nwell as more than $1,000 in currency and some marijuana. As the police were\nsearching this person\u2019s home, Applicant entered the residence unannounced. Asked\nabout his intentions, Applicant explained that he had just left the business where he had\nheard that something was going on and that he wanted to check on the occupant of the\nresidence. Applicant appeared intoxicated. An officer conducted a \u201cpat-down search\u201d of\nApplicant for safety reasons, and he found in Applicant\u2019s right pocket a green package\ncontaining a substance that tested positive for cocaine and a rolled one-dollar bill.\nApplicant was arrested for felony possession of a schedule I-V controlled substance\n(cocaine). Applicant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in June 2007. In late August\n2007, he was placed in a pretrial diversion program, and on completion his case was\ndismissed in early May 2008. (Ex. 5).\nOn June 5, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis arrest for possession of cocaine. Applicant related (in variance to the police report)\nthat he had been doing his laundry at a local laundromat when he decided to visit his\nfriend. He claimed that he was searched when he first arrived at his friend\u2019s home, but\nthat nothing was found on him until he was detained and searched a second time.\nApplicant admitted that a small amount of cocaine was then discovered in his pant\npocket. The charges against him were still pending but his lawyer had assured him the\ncharges would be dismissed due to the \u201cunfounded second personal search.\u201d According\nto the investigator, Applicant denied any use of illegal drugs other than cocaine, which\nhe first used in 1980, and snorted at parties once every two to three years when it was\ngiven to him. Applicant denied any use of cocaine since his recent arrest, or any intent\nto use cocaine in the future. Applicant related that the cocaine found on his person had\nbeen given to him at a party two days before his arrest but that he had last used\ncocaine three years before his arrest (Ex. 4).\nAt DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant subsequently reviewed the investigator\u2019s report of\nhis June 2007 interview for its accuracy. On May 23, 2008, Applicant responded in part:\nInvestigator states that I use cocaine when people give it to me. The\ninvestigator made this statement sound current when it is not. I did tell the\ninvestigator that I had tried cocaine in the past at parties etc. This\nexperimentation with cocaine occurred in my early twenties and thirties. I\nhave in the past used bad judgment and made mistakes that I truly regret.\n\n5\nApplicant provided documentation showing that he had completed the court-ordered\nadult diversion program as of mid-April 2008, and that the charges pending against him\nwould be dismissed (Ex. 4).\nAt his hearing on December 19, 2008, Applicant testified that he last used\nmarijuana \u201c[y]ears and years and years ago . . . High school, a little after high school.\u201d\nApplicant subsequently admitted he had illegal possession of, and was smoking\nmarijuana, to his arrest in 1981 (Tr. 53). As for his last use of cocaine, Applicant\nresponded, \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not sure of the date. It could have been 20, 25 years ago.\u201d He\ndenied any use of cocaine since going to work for the defense contractor and averred\nthat he used cocaine only about five times total (Tr. 35). He maintained that he was\n\"under duress\" when he told the government investigator in June 2007 that he had used\ncocaine on average every two to three years (Tr. 43-44). He denied that he had used\ncocaine after being granted a security clearance in 2001 (Tr. 49).\nConcerning his arrest for illegal possession in October 2006, Applicant testified\nthat he had been at a party at a stranger\u2019s house with \u201ca bunch of people\u201d that he had\nmet at a bar. As to how he happened to be given the cocaine, Applicant claimed he took\nit just to be \u201csociable\u201d and that he did not believe he would have used what he assumed\nwas cocaine at some later point (Tr. 36). Applicant denied that he had used any of the\ncocaine given to him on that occasion or otherwise at the party before his arrest (Tr.\n37). Applicant also denied that he deliberately withheld any information about his illegal\ndrug involvement on his applications for a security clearance (Tr. 47) until he was\nquestioned by me about the omission of cocaine use from his NAQ. On December 22,\n2008, Applicant signed a statement of his intent to dissociate himself from drug-using\nassociates and contacts and to abstain from using and drugs with the understanding\nthat any violation would result in the immediate automatic revocation of his security\nclearance (Ex. A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Police records confirm, and Applicant does not deny, that he was caught\nwith marijuana in his possession in September 1981 and with cocaine in his possession\nin October 2006. Despite Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to minimize the extent of his illegal\ndrug involvement (see Guideline E, infra), his prior admissions to government\ninvestigators support factual findings of marijuana use on average twice a month from\n1975 to 1981, and of cocaine use initially in 1980 and then on an estimated basis of\nonce every two to three years until at least 2003, if not to the date of his arrest in\nOctober 2006. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\n\n7\ndrug paraphernalia,\u201d and 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance,\u201d apply.\nConcerning the potential mitigating factors under AG \u00b6 26, there is no evidence\nshowing Applicant has used or possessed any marijuana since his arrest in September\n1981. However, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be fully\napplied because of his more recent cocaine abuse and possession. It is difficult to\nbelieve that he did not use any cocaine at that party in October 2006, or, if he did not\nuse the cocaine, that he took it with no intent to use it in the future. Even if he last used\ncocaine in 2003, his illegal possession of the drug in October 2006, especially while he\nheld a security clearance, raises serious doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness,\nand judgment.\nApplicant submitted post hearing a written statement indicating that he is\ndissociated from drug-using associates (see AG \u00b6 25(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-\nusing associates and contacts\u201d), and that he does not intend to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture with the understanding that his clearance would be revoked for any violation (see\nAG \u00b6 25(b)(4), \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation\u201d). Applicant\u2019s credibility is suspect because of his deliberate falsifications\nabout his illegal drug involvement during the investigation and adjudication of his\nsecurity clearance. His uncorroborated claims are not sufficient to demonstrate the\nintent required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future.\"\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for his confidential-level clearance in June 1994, he\nclaimed that he had tried marijuana only a couple of times in 1975 and had not used it\nsince (Ex. 3). His minimization of his marijuana involvement and omission of his cocaine\nabuse from that NAQ raise potentially disqualifying security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a),\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d In a sworn statement of February 2, 1995, provided during a subject\n\n8\ninterview, Applicant falsely denied any use of illegal drugs other than marijuana (\u201cI have\nnever used or experimented with any other illegal drugs.\u201d). AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative,\u201d also applies. \nFurthermore, on his security clearance application completed for continuation of\nhis secret-level security clearance in June 2005, Applicant again concealed his\ninvolvement with cocaine by responding \u201cNo\u201d to question 27 (any use of illegal drugs in\nthe last seven years), and question 28 (any use of illegal drugs while possessing a\nsecurity clearance). AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to these falsifications.\nPotential personal vulnerability issues are also raised by Applicant\u2019s concealment\nof relevant and material facts about his illegal drug involvement (see AG \u00b6 16(e),\n\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities\nwhich, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding\u201d).  Applicant told a government investigator in February 1995 that he had not\nrevealed the extent of his marijuana involvement on his June 1994 NAQ because he did\nnot think a secretary assisting him with the form had a reason to know the information.\nHe admitted to me at his security clearance hearing that he had not disclosed his\ncocaine use on that form because he was concerned it could affect his clearance.\nApplicant acknowledged to Department Counsel at his hearing that he had not told his\nsupervisor about his October 2006 drug arrest, but he contends that he did not have to\nbecause his coworkers read about his arrest in the paper. He provided no corroboration\nfor that claim. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies.\nAlso alleged was Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine after he had been granted a security\nclearance in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.e).  Certainly Applicant exercised poor judgment that would\nraise security concerns under AG \u00b6 15, but that conduct is more directly addressed by\nGuideline H (see AG \u00b6 25(g)).\nNone of the pertinent mitigating conditions fully apply to his repeated\nconcealment of relevant and material facts concerning his illegal drug abuse history.\nAlthough Applicant acknowledged in his February 1995 statement that his marijuana\nuse had been more extensive than he had reported on his June 1994 NAQ, his\nconcealment of his cocaine abuse from that statement and from his SF 86 completed in\nJune 2005 preclude favorable consideration of AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s recent attempts to discredit his prior admissions of drug use\nundermine his case for mitigation under either AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or\nso much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d or AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual\n\n9\nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur.\u201d In May 2008, Applicant objected to the investigator\u2019s use of the\npresent tense in June 2007 when discussing his cocaine abuse, as his \u201cexperimentation\nwith cocaine occurred in [his] early twenties and thirties.\u201d While the investigator reported\nApplicant\u2019s use of cocaine in the present tense (\u201cSUBJECT USES COCAINE RARELY\nAND ESTIMATES HE USES COCAINE ONCE EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS\u201d), the\ninvestigator also indicated that Applicant last used cocaine three years prior to his\narrest. Had Applicant not used any cocaine in the past 20 or 25 years (Tr. 32), he likely\nwould not have told the investigator that his last use of cocaine occurred as recently as\n2003. There is no evidence to suggest that the investigator had any reason to report\nother than what Applicant told her. When confronted at his December 2008 hearing\nabout his previous estimate of cocaine use every two to three years, Applicant did not\ndeny that he made that statement:\nI believe I wrote that in a rebuttal\u2013I was pretty scared at the time and she\nasked me when was the last time you did cocaine and I says I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe two or three years or something like that. But I said it under duress;\nThat wasn\u2019t an accurate statement . . .  It was just a blurt because I was\nscared. I just wanted to move on. I said it to accommodate her. (Tr. 43)\nApplicant would stand to gain little by admitting relatively recent cocaine use unless it\nwas the truth. He also admitted SOR \u00b6 2.e (one-time use of cocaine while holding a\nsecurity clearance granted in 2001) when he answered the SOR. While he now claims\nthat it was not in his handwriting, he admits he \u201cmight have\u201d completed his Answer with\nthe aid of his attorney (Tr. 49). By signing his Answer, Applicant adopted the responses\nas his own.\nApplicant claims that he has been \u201cpretty much straight\u201d with his coworkers about\nhis October 2006 cocaine arrest. Given his persistent unwillingness to provide a\ncredible account of his illegal drug involvement or of his motives for his NAQ and SF 86\nomissions, AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d does not apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n10\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant was granted his confidential security clearance in 1995 after he had\nfalsely claimed on an NAQ and to a government agent that he had not used any illegal\ndrug other than marijuana. He continued to use cocaine, including on at least one\noccasion after his clearance had been upgraded to secret in 2001, and he was placed in\na diversion program for an October 2006 illegal possession of cocaine offense.\nAlthough the felony charge was dismissed in May 2008 on his completion of the\ndiversion program, and he has submitted a statement of intent to refrain from any future\nillegal drug involvement, I am unable to conclude that his drug abuse is safely behind\nhim, or that his representations can be relied on. Applicant would now have the\ngovernment believe that he had put his cocaine abuse behind him some 20 to 25 years\nago, he just happened to be given a package of cocaine by unknown persons he felt\ncomfortable with by simply sharing a beer or two at a bar, and he did not use or intend\nto use the cocaine in October 2006. His illegal possession of cocaine alone reflects\nextremely poor judgment on his part. His lack of forthright testimony at his hearing about\nhis illegal drug involvement compounds the concerns for his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness and his 19 years of employment with a defense contractor are not\nsufficient to mitigate those concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR with explanation. Applicant is a 41-year-old interpreter/translator who has worked for a defense contractor at a sensitive location performing sensitive translations. He worked at that location for about a year until the SOR was issued. He held an interim security clearance during that time. He is highly regarded and valued by the United States military for his work as an interpreter (Tr. 30-31, 43-44; App. Ex. A, Letter of Recommendation, dated December 22, 2006; App. Ex.

He is now working for another defense contractor as an interpreter/translator on non- classified material. He will resume working for the defense contractor as an interpreter/translator when cleared for access to classified information. He is also employed as a furniture salesman when he is not working as a translator/interpreter. He is married with four children.

On May 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nApplicant under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on MAY 23, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 27, 2008, admitting all factual allegations in the SOR with a \ndetailed explanation.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment counsel was prepared to proceed on September 2, 2008, and I was \nassigned the case on September 4, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 15, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 9, 2008.  \nThe government offered two exhibits, marked Gov.

Applicant had no objection to the requests for \nadministrative notice and the attached documents.  The facts administratively noticed \nare set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation.   \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old interpreter/translator who has worked for a defense \ncontractor at a sensitive location performing sensitive translations.  He worked at that \nlocation for about a year until the SOR was issued.  He held an interim security \nclearance during that time.  He is highly regarded and valued by the United States \nmilitary for his work as an interpreter (Tr. 30-31, 43-44; App. Ex. A, Letter of \nRecommendation, dated December 22, 2006; App. Ex. B, Letter, dated December 22, \n2006; App. Ex. C, Service certificate, undated; App. Ex. D, Performance Certificate, \ndated December 19, 2006; App. Ex. E, Performance Certificate, dated February 2006).  \nHe is now working for another defense contractor as an interpreter/translator on non-\nclassified material.  He will resume working for the defense contractor as an \ninterpreter/translator when cleared for access to classified information.  He is also \nemployed as a furniture salesman when he is not working as a translator/interpreter.  \nHe is married with four children.  His wife and children were all born in United States \nand are United States citizens (Tr. 27-31, 41-43; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated November \n15, 2005)   \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq in 1967.  His father worked in the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE) while the family stayed in Iraq.  The situation for the family because of \nreligious, ethnic, and political issues and their father's absence became intolerable, so \nin 1974 the family moved to the UAE to be with their father.  Applicant was seven years \nold at the time.  Neither Applicant nor his family members have been to Iraq since they \nleft in 1974.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant lived in the UAE from 1974 until 1993.  He completed his schooling, \nthrough high school, in the UAE.  He tried to become a UAE citizen in 1983 when he \ncompleted high school, and again in 1989.  He did not qualify for UAE citizenship.  He \nalso tried to join the UAE Air Force in 1983 after graduating from high school.  The only \nway to become a UAE citizen is to marry a UAE citizen.  A person can also be \nsponsored for UAE citizenship by a member of the royal family.  Since Applicant did not \nmarry a UAE citizen and did not have royal family connections, he was arbitrarily denied \nUAE citizenship (Tr. 29-35, 80-81; Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated April 14, 2008). \n \nApplicant and his sister came to the United States on November 15, 1993, for a \nvisit, and he remained He has been in the United States for the last 15 years.  He \nreceived his permanent resident card in 1995 shortly before his original visa for the \nUnited States expired.  He married his wife in November 1994, and became a United \nStates citizen as soon as he could in July 2000 (Tr. 35-37).  He has never been to Iraq \nsince he left in 1974.  He returned to the UAE to see his family twice since coming to \nthe United States.  He returned in February 2005 when his mother was sick, and \nOctober 2007 to visit for the religious holidays.  He stays with his relatives when he \nvisits.  He also has visited two nephews in Canada who he visited a number of times.  \nThe last time was a few weeks before the hearing to celebrate the end of a religious \nperiod (Tr. 25-26, 59-61, 78-81). \n \nApplicant and his wife own the house in which they reside.  They also own a \nformer residence now a rental house in another state.  Both houses have a mortgage.  \nHe also has a checking and savings account in a bank in the United States.  Applicant's \nwife is a customer service representative for a retail chain.  Neither Applicant nor his \nwife own any foreign property or have any foreign assets.  He does not belong to any \nprofessional or cultural organizations and he has no business or professional contacts \noutside the United States (Tr. 36-43).  \n \nApplicant had an Iraqi passport when he came to the United States in 1993.  The \npassport expired in 1995.  He returned the expired passport to the Iraqi Embassy on \nJanuary 11, 2007.  He also informed the Embassy that he renounced his Iraqi \ncitizenship (Tr. 28, App. Ex. G, Postal Receipt, dated January 11, 2007).  Applicant \nbelieved he was not considered an Iraqi citizen when he received his United States \npermanent residence status and his Iraqi passport had expired. (Tr. 48-50).  Applicant \nwas issued a United States passport on February 26, 2001, shortly after becoming a \nUnited States citizen (See Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated April 14, 2008 at exhibit B). \n \nApplicant admits his mother, four brothers, and two sisters are citizens of Iraq but \nresidents of the UAE.  He admits that two sisters and their husbands are citizens and \nresides of the UAE.  He admits he has a childhood friend who is a citizen and resident \nof the UAE, and a member of the UAE Air Force.  He also admits to traveling to the \nUAE in 2005 and 2007 (See Response to SOR, dated May 27, 2008). \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant's mother was born in Iraq in 1941 and lived there until she emigrated to \nthe UAE with her children in 1974.  The family moved because they were living in a \nBaghdad neighborhood where she was home alone with four daughters and no \nhusband residing in the home.  Their family was not of the same religion of the \nneighbors.  She also wanted to reunite and live with her husband and the children's \nfather.  Applicant's mother is not employed outside the home, and is supported by \nApplicant's brother and sisters with whom she lives.  Applicant will occasionally send \nher money, usually during religious holidays.  However, she does not talk to him \nbecause she is upset with him for unknown reasons.  When they did talk, they \ndiscussed her health and his sibling.  His mother came to the United States to visit him \nin 2003 or 2004 and stayed for a month.  She receives her health care through the UAE \nhealth clinics.  Applicant believes his mother visited Iraq a few times after she left there \nuntil the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  She has not visited Iraq since then.  It is not \nconsidered safe for his family to go to Iraq because of terrorism and the constant \nfighting between the Sunni and Shi'ite religious groups.  His mother cannot become a \nUAE citizen because UAE citizenship can be obtained only if the person marries a UAE \ncitizen or is sponsored by the royal family (Tr. 43-48).  Applicant has distant relatives in \nIraq but has no contact with them.  His mother has contact with them about once a year.  \nShe has sent them some money to assist them, usually during the religious holidays (Tr. \n48-56, 58-59). \n \nApplicant has four brothers and four sisters, all residents of UAE.  All except two \nsisters, who are married to UAE citizens, may be citizens of Iraq.  When the family left \nIraq in 1974, they carried the \"S\" series Iraqi passport.  Iraqi citizens with this passport \nare considered to have the \"Ottoman\" citizenship which is no longer recognized by the \nnew Iraqi government.  The family members, to include his mother, brothers, and non-\nUAE citizen sisters, tried to get new updated passports but their requests were denied.  \nIn effect, Applicant's family members in UAE, except for the two married sisters, are not \ncitizens of any country (Tr. 48-54; App. Ex. F, U.S. State Department notice on \"S\" type \nIraqi passports, dated October 8, 2008).  \n \nApplicant's oldest brother is a real estate agent in UAE.  He is married with four \nchildren, two of which live in Canada.  Applicant talks to his brother monthly during calls \ninitiated by either of them.  Applicant has sent him funds when he needs it for \nprescription drugs and food.  Another brother is a maintenance inspector for a \ngovernment agency, has three children, and lives in the same house with his mother.  \nApplicant last talked to this brother in October 2007 during his visit to UAE.  Another \nbrother is an actor in commercials.  He also has three children and lives in the same \nhouse with his mother.  He talks to this brother about once every other month.  His \nfourth brother works in advertising, has two sons, and also lives in the same house with \ntheir mother.  Applicant usually communicates with him over the internet on a monthly \nbasis (Tr. 61-66). \n \nOne of Applicant's sisters is a homemaker and married to a UAE citizen who is a \npetroleum engineer working for a UAE government agency.  He talks to her about once \nevery few months.  They last talked before the latest religious holiday.  Another sister is \n\n \n5 \n \n \nalso a homemaker and married to a UAE citizen who works as a communications \nengineer for a government agency.  This sister and her husband were educated in the \nUnited States.  His two brothers-in-law are not fully supportive of United States foreign \npolicy.  These two sisters are citizens of the UAE since they married UAE citizens (Tr. \n66-73).  He has two other sisters, one is married and a housewife, the other is not \nmarried and a doctor.  They are not citizens of the UAE even though the housewife is \nmarried to a UAE citizen and eligible for UAE citizenship.  Applicant has borrowed \nmoney from his sisters when he needed it and also sent them money when they needed \nit.  He does not talk to his mother, siblings, or in-laws about his work.  None of his \nbrothers or brothers-in-law served in the UAE military (Tr. 73-77, 81-83).   \n \nApplicant's boyhood friend is a pilot and officer in the UAE Air Force.  His friend \nvisited him in the United States twice when the friend was sent to the United States for \nadditional training.  He also talks to him about once or twice a year by telephone (Tr. 83-\n87). \n \n \nA United States led coalition in 2003 removed the Ba\u2019ath regime from power in \nIraq after more than 30 years of rule.  A new democratic government is being formed \nwith citizens participating in democratic elections.  However, remnants of the former \nregime, transnational terrorists, and criminal elements remain very active in the country.  \nThere are continuous attacks against military and civilian targets.  There are planned \nand random killings, extortions, and kidnappings.  There were reports of arbitrary \ndeprivation of life, torture, impunity, and poor prison conditions.  Civic life and the social \nfabric remained under intense strain from the active insurgency, as well as from a \ncontinuing shortage of basic services and staples.  However, the new government\u2019s \nsuccess in building an accommodating structure for the exercise of civil liberties, \nalthough burdened by the heritage of dictatorship and disregard for law, was clearly \nshown in the citizens\u2019 embrace of freedoms of speech and press, peaceful assembly, \nassociation, and religion.  While major problems still remain, they are of a far less \nmagnitude and nature than previously (See Hearing Exhibit 1). \n \n \nThe UAE is a federation of individual ruled emirates.  The government is a \nfederal republic with a president and council of ministers.  Its laws and practices come \nfrom Islamic ideals and beliefs.  Only 15% to 20% of the people living in the UAE are \nconsidered citizens.  Educational standards are high and continue to improve.   \n \n \nThe UAE has significant gas and oil reserves which are expected to last into the \nnext century.  This gives the UAE significant resources to invest around the world.  The \nUAE is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Gulf Cooperation \nCounsel.  It has diplomatic relations with more than 60 countries including the United \nStates and the other major industrial nations.  UAE is also active in the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting \nCounties.   \n \nThe United States and UAE have had friendly relations since 1971.  Friendly \npetroleum commercial relations developed into friendly government-to-government ties \n\n \n6 \n \n \nincluding security assistance.  The relationship increased dramatically as a result of the \nUnited States led coalition campaign to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.  In \n2002, the United States and the UAE launched a strategic partnership dialogue \ncovering virtually every aspect of the relationship.  The UAE has been a key partner in \nthe War on Terror, and UAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any other port \noutside the U.S.  While the UAE has cooperated with the United States on terrorism, the \nUAE was one of three countries to recognize the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. \n \n \nThe country is one of the leading United States and coalition partners in the \nregion against terrorism, providing military, diplomatic and financial assistance.  In \ngeneral, United States intelligence agencies report that terrorists have targeted United \nStates personnel and interests to collect intelligence through human espionage and by \nother means.  Travelers are advised by the State Department to be cautious of their \nsurroundings and to maintain a high level of vigilance.   \n \n \nThere are limited human rights problems due to lack of elections, a questionably \nindependent judiciary, and restrictions on civil liberties in the UAE.  There are no reports \nof arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life and no politically motivated disappearances.  \nThere are no reports of torture which is prohibited by the constitution.  However, \nflogging is a recognized punishment.  Prison conditions vary throughout the country with \nwomen receiving better treatment than men.  Arbitrary arrests and detention are \nprohibited but there are reports of the government holding people without charges.  \nWhile the law prohibits arrests and searches without probable cause, incidents do take \nplace in practice.  Fair and public but not timely trials are provided.  United States' \ncompanies have been convicted of violating export control laws for their trading with \nUAE companies (Hearing Exhibit 2).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the United \nStates interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests.  \nAdjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including but not \nlimited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism (AG \u00b6 6). \n \n \nApplicant has foreign contacts through his mother, four brothers, and two sisters \nwho are considered for security clearance purposes citizens of Iraq but residents of the \nUAE.  He also has foreign contacts with two sisters and their husbands who are citizens \nand residents of the UAE.  He also has foreign contact with a boyhood friend who is a \ncitizen and resident of the UAE and an officer in the UAE Air Force.  The government \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhas established that these contacts raise security concerns under Foreign Influence \nDisqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7(a) \"Contact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\"; and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) \"Connections to \na foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of \ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology \nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation\".  Each individual contact by itself may not create a risk of foreign influence, \nbut the totality of the contacts may indicate a risk of foreign influence.   \n \n \nThe government has alleged in the SOR a security concern because Applicant's \nfamily members are citizens of Iraq.  The government established the allegation of Iraqi \ncitizenship based solely on the admission of Applicant in his response to the SOR that \nhis family members are citizens of Iraqi.  However, Applicant credibly testified that he \nand his mother and siblings left Iraqi in 1974 for the UAE because of political and social \npressures in Iraq and to join their father who was working in the UAE.  The family has \nnot been back to Iraq in 34 years.  Applicant has not been to Iraq since he left at age \nseven.  The present Iraqi government does not consider the family members Iraqi \ncitizens since they did not vote in the latest elections held by the new government.  The \nfamily members hold only the \"S\" series Iraqi passport which is no longer recognized as \nvalid by the Iraqi government.  Iraq will not issue them a new passport because they are \nnot considered Iraqi citizens.  In addition, the family members not married to UAE \ncitizens cannot become citizens of the UAE under the UAE criteria for citizenship.  They \nare in fact stateless people.  They have no country in which they can call themselves \ncitizens.  Applicant has no contact or connection to any persons now in Iraq.  His \nmother occasionally talks to distant relatives still residing in Iraq.  While the country of \nIraq presents security clearance issues, I find under the circumstances that Applicant \nand his family have such minimal contacts with Iraq that there is no security concern \nbased on Iraqi citizenship of the family.  There still remains a security concern for the \ncontacts Applicant has with his family members residing in the UAE. \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. \nBd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); and ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)).  Thus, an administrative judge was not \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 7(a), \nand (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15).  An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government (See, ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members and friend in UAE \ncause security concerns, I considered that UAE is an ally of the United States, has a \ndefense agreement with the United States, and is one of the United States\u2019 trading \npartners.  I considered that UAE is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, \nthe Gulf Cooperating Counsel, and other international organizations.  I also considered \nthe United States relationship with the UAE.  More United States Navy ships make port \nvisits to the UAE than any port outside the United States.  The UAE partners with the \nUnited States and other countries in the fight against global terrorism.  There are no \nindications that the UAE targets United States citizens to provide economic or other \nsensitive information.  There are issues of terrorist activities in the UAE but not any \nmore that in any other country. \n \n \nWhile the UAE is a country that is friendly to the United Stares, it could engage in \nespionage against United States interests.  Friendly countries may have profound \ndisagreements with the United States and some have engaged in espionage against \nUnited States economic, scientific, or technical interests.  A friendly relationship is not \ndeterminative, but it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to \nexploit a United States citizen through relatives or associates in that country.  The UAE \nis not a hostile country, nor is its interests inimical to the United States.  The United \nStates and UAE are democracies, enjoy good relations, and are trading partners.  It \nwould be considered an act unfriendly to the interest of the United States for the UAE to \ncoerce its residents to pressure their United States relatives to provide economic or \nother espionage information against the interest of the United States.  It is reasonable to \nconsider that UAE would not take any action to jeopardize their friendly position with the \nUnited States because of their need for trade and defense assistance from the United \nStates.  There is terrorism in the UAE but it is no more prevalent than in any other \ncountry.  UAE does take steps to limit terrorist activities.  The threat of terrorist action \nagainst residents of the UAE to coerce United States citizens is no greater than most \nother countries in the region.  While none of the considerations by themselves dispose \nof the issue, they are all factors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability \nto pressure or coercion from his family members in UAE. \n \n \nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) \"the \nnature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe United States\".  Applicant\u2019s mother is a housewife who lives with some of her \nchildren and their families.  Applicant\u2019s siblings and their spouses are professionals who \n\n \n10 \n \n \nworked for both private businesses and the UAE government.  Applicant talked to his \nmother frequently in the past even though now they do not talk as much.  He talks to his \nvarious siblings more often.  Applicant made two trips to UAE since he left there in 1993 \nto come to the United States.  His mother has visited him and his family in the United \nStates.  Some of his siblings and their spouses have been educated in the United \nStates.   \n \n \nIt is clear that there is a close family relationship.  His contacts with his \nimmediate family are frequent and not casual.  The information Applicant presented \nconcerning his family members\u2019 living conditions, life style, and professions show it is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position to choose between the interests of his \nfamily in the UAE and the interests of the United States.  Applicant established his \nfamily members in UAE are ordinary citizens leading normal lives, and that they do not \npresent a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.  The positions and activities of his family and the nature of the UAE \ngovernment and terrorist activities show that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in \na position of being coerced or pressured to choose between these people and his \ninterests in protecting the national security of the United States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant also raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) \"there is no conflict of interest either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, \nor country is minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest\".  Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to duress is also \nimportant.  Applicant has been in the United States for over 15 years, and a United \nStates citizen for over eight years.  His wife is a native born citizen and resident of the \nUnited States.  His four children were born in the United States and reside in the United \nStates with their parents.  Applicant's assets are in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s two \ntrips to UAE were to visit family.  He visited his sick mother and for a religious holiday.  \nHe traveled on his United States passport.  I also considered that Applicant performed \nvery well for the United States in a sensitive and important task in defense of the United \nStates (See ISCR Case No. 07-000343 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008), (\"an applicant's \nproven record of action on defense of the U.S. is very important and can lead to a \nfavorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B case\").  Applicant has a normal sense \nof loyalty or obligation to his family in UAE.  But he also has long standing relationship \nand connections in the United States.  He has demonstrated that these relationships will \nlead him to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  Applicant has \ndemonstrated that he is not unusually vulnerable to duress.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant raised in regard to his boyhood friend FI MC \u00b6 8(c) \"contact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\".  Applicant has \nthe burden of presenting information to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the government.  Applicant's contacts with his boyhood friend who is \na member of the UAE Air Force are casual and infrequent.  He has seen the friend \nwhen the friend came to the United States for training with the United States Air Force.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nHe saw him on his visits to the UAE.  Their telephone or e-mail contacts are minimal, \nusually to exchange greetings during religious holidays.  There is little likelihood that the \ncontacts with his friend could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \nAccordingly, FI MC 8(c) applies to his friend in UAE.   \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant has met his heavy burden to show that the contacts with his \nfamily and friend in the UAE do not cause a security concern.  I conclude the Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Conditions, at AGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c), are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances in this case.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept requires \nconsideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single item in isolation, \nto reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.  \nApplicant\u2019s family in UAE both individually and collectively are not in positions and \ncircumstances that make it likely Applicant will be placed in a position to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and the interest of the United States, or that he can \nbe exploited, pressured, or coerced because of them.  His contacts with his family in \nUAE are strong but they do not create a conflict of interest between the family members \nand his loyalty to the United States.  Applicant has been in the United States for over 15 \nyears and a citizen of the United States for over eight years.  His wife and children were \nborn here and are United States citizens.  He performed well and successfully in \ndefense of the United States in a sensitive position.  His travels to UAE were for \npleasure to visit family members and not connected to the UAE government.  He \nestablished that his contacts with his family and friend in UAE do not indicate a security \nrisk.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s life story is an example of the success of many immigrants to the \nUnited States.  He came to the United States to better himself through education.  He \nremained here, became a United States citizen, established himself in his community, \nand worked to obtain a better life in the United States.  He performed well in a sensitive \nposition in defense of the United States.  His family enjoys a typical United States life \nstyle and he successfully contributed to the United States.  Overall, on balance the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), based on a single delinquent debt of about $146,000. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 14, 2007. On \nSeptember 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 24, 2008; answered it on October 13, \n2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on October 16, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October \n31, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on the same day. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on November 24, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through H, which were admitted without objection. \nI held the record open to permit both parties to submit evidence and argument on an \nissue of reciprocal recognition of clearances, and they submitted Hearing Exhibits (HX) I \nand II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 23, 2008. The record closed on \nJanuary 9, 2009. \n \nReciprocal Recognition of Clearance \n \n \nApplicant testified he had received a clearance from another federal agency (Tr. \n84-86). Based on his testimony, I directed the parties to provide evidence and legal \nauthorities pertaining to Applicant\u2019s entitlement to reciprocal recognition of his clearance \nfrom another federal agency. \n \nThe National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD \n5220.22-M, February 28, 2006, paragraph 2-204, provides:  \n \nAny previously granted PCL [personnel clearance] that is based upon a \ncurrent investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for \nthe clearance required shall provide the basis for issuance of a new \nclearance without further investigation or adjudication unless significant \nderogatory information that was not previously adjudicated becomes \nknown to the granting agency.   \n \n \nThe documents submitted by Applicant and his facility security officer reflect that \nhe received a clearance based on a \u201cminimum background investigation,\u201d much \nnarrower in scope than required for a security clearance, and his existing clearance \ndoes not allow access to classified information. Accordingly, I have concluded he is not \nentitled to reciprocal recognition of his clearance from another federal agency. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt alleged in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old information systems engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2007. He has a favorable trustworthiness determination from \nanother federal agency based on a \u201cminimum background investigation.\u201d That \ndetermination was not a security clearance. He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse are natives of Bangladesh. He came to the U.S. on a \ntourist visa. He obtained a student visa and attended college in the U.S. from January \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1988 to July 1991, when he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in information systems. \nHe and his spouse were married in August 1993. They have two children, ages 11 and \n7. He became a U.S. citizen in July 1996, and his spouse became a U.S. citizen in \nMarch 2002.  \n \n \nThe debt arose when Applicant signed as a guarantor on a small business loan \nof $205,000 to purchase a day care center in the spring of 2002, to be operated by \nApplicant and his spouse (Tr. 49-50). The day care center was fully licensed to operate \nat the time it was purchased (Tr. 45). Applicant and his spouse purchased the \ncorporation that had been operating the day care center, and the loan was made to the \ncorporation, with Applicant as guarantor (Tr. 45-47). Applicant handled the \nadministration of the business during his off-duty hours and his spouse managed the \ndaily operations (Tr. 51). The business took more time to manage than they expected \nand the regulations were more complex and onerous than expected. In 2004, the county \nwithdrew his operating license for regulatory noncompliance (Tr. 52-54, 81-82). \nApplicant and his spouse unsuccessfully attempted to sell the business (Tr. 53). \n \nApplicant and his spouse made payments on the loan for about two years. After \nthe day care center defaulted on the loan, the lender demanded payment from Applicant \nas guarantor of the loan (Tr. 64). In addition, the lender took the $30,000 certificate of \ndeposit Applicant had pledged as collateral for the loan (Tr. 56-57). In June 2005, \nApplicant offered to settle the debt for $8,000, but his offer was rejected on the ground \nthat he had sufficient equity in his personal residence to satisfy the debt in full (AX E). In \nFebruary 2006, the lender obtained a judgment against him for $168,519 (GX 2). In May \nor June 2006, he offered $18,000 to settle the debt, and later offered $20,000, but these \noffers also were rejected. Although rejecting his offers, the lender suggested that a \nsettlement for half the equity in his home might be acceptable. The principal balance in \nJune 2007 was $148,625 (AX D). His lawyer has suggested bankruptcy as an option, \nbut he rejected that option as a \u201cmatter of dignity.\u201d (Tr. 83.) The debt has not been \nresolved.  \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in July 2007, Applicant reported \nnet monthly household income of $8,485; expenses of $2,815; debt payments of $2,905 \n(1st mortgage), $623 (2nd mortgage), and $621 (car payment), leaving a net remainder \nof $1,521 (GX 3 at 4). The car loan has since been paid off. He is current on all his \nfinancial obligations except the unpaid judgment (AX A, B, and C). \n \nApplicant testified he estimated the market value of his residence at between \n$650,000 and $700,000 (Tr. 67). The balance on his first mortgage is about $298,000 \n(Tr. 69; GX 5 at 3). He also obtained a second mortgage for about $81,000 in October \n2001 (Tr. 70). He used the second mortgage to make improvements to his home and \npay off a car loan. The home improvements were made over several years. He \nborrowed about $36,000 to purchase a new car in the fall of 2005. He also owns two \nolder cars. Even though he has about $240,000 in equity in his home, he testified he \nhas not borrowed against his equity because he would not be able to afford the \npayments if he increased the amount of his loan (Tr. 70-71). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges an unsatisfied judgment against Applicant in the amount of \n$168,000. The evidence shows that the balance due is $146,625. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history raises both of these \ndisqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to him to refute, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and a final conjunctive prong. If any of \nthe three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished unless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because the debt \nis not resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is established because there is only \none debt, incurred almost seven years ago. The third prong (\u201cunder such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is established because the debt was incurred when Applicant \nand his spouse decided to buy a business without realizing the complexity of the \nregulatory requirements for operating a day care center and without realizing how much \nof their available time would be required to properly operate it. Applicant has learned \nfrom his experience and is not likely to venture into such uncharted waters again.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe final prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d on current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment) is not established. Applicant\u2019s decision to buy the business and \nguarantee the loan was due to his lack of experience. He has learned from that \nexperience and has not demonstrated bad judgment in any other financial matters. \nHowever, he has not taken reasonable measures to resolve the debt, thereby raising \ndoubt about his reliability and trustworthiness. His settlement offers of $8,000 and \n$10,000 bordered on the frivolous. In the fall of 2005, he borrowed $36,000 to buy a \nnew car, even though he already owned two cars and his day care business was in \ndistress. He bought the new car shortly after his settlement offer of $8,000 was rejected. \nHe has rejected his lawyer\u2019s advice to pursue a bankruptcy action, even though a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy would allow him to pay the balance in installments while \npreserving his dignity. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established because Applicant and his \nspouse made a deliberate decision to borrow the money and buy the business. The \nsecond prong also is not established, because Applicant has not acted responsibly in \nresolving the debt, for the reasons set out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas retained a lawyer to assist him, but there is no evidence the problem is being \nresolved or under control. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nOther than making a few unrealistic settlement offers, Applicant has done virtually \nnothing to resolve the debt. His most recent offer to settle the debt for $20,000 was \nrejected about 18 months ago, in June 2007. He did not respond to the offer to settle for \nhalf his home equity. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, articulate person. He was candid and \nsincere at the hearing. He regrets the bad business decision that caused his \nindebtedness, but he has not been diligent in resolving it. He has retained a lawyer to \nassist him, but no significant progress has been made. Until he can resolve the debt, he \nwill continue to be vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 6, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and \nrevised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other \ndeterminations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nJuly 8, 2008\n\n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                              \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 6, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 28, 2008, was \nprovided to her, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did not submit any \ninformation within the 30-day time period after receiving a copy of the FORM. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 24, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. I make the following additional findings of \nfact:  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old parts inspector, who has worked for her \ngovernment contractor employer since July 2007. She is a first-time applicant for \na security clearance. She attended an agricultural and technical state university \nfrom August 1981 to December 1986, and was awarded a diploma. Applicant has \nbeen married since June 1992, and has a 15-year-old daughter, and a 12-year-old \nson.3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her e-QIP,4 her January 2008 credit bureau report,5 and \nher September 2007 credit bureau report.6 The government established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented that Applicant has six delinquent \n \nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was \nissued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \n2 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Mar. 28, \n2008; and Applicant acknowledged receipt on Apr. 15, 2008, which DOHA received on Apr. 18, \n2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s \nreceipt to submit information. \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Item 5. \n \n6 Item 6. \n\n \n3\n                                                          \ndebts totaling $25,876. These debts appear to be delinquent since 2005 - 2006. \nApplicant offered no documentation that any of her debts have been paid, that she \nhas set up payment plans, nor has she submitted any evidence that she \ncontacted any creditors. Furthermore, Applicant did not submit any evidence of \nextenuating circumstances or character evidence. The only input provided by \nApplicant was her handwritten admissions on the face of her SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto \n \n7 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing \ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being \nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 \n(1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n\n \n4\n                                                          \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, \n1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),9 the Government\u2019s concern \nis that an Applicant\u2019s \n \n \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged her indebtedness through her admissions. Her \nadmissions are corroborated by government exhibits. In the absence of further \n \n \n8 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable \nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent \nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion \nunder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n9  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n5\ninformation, I am unable to glean any further information, favorable or \nunfavorable, with regard to identified financial concerns. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt \nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be \nexplained by subject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \nlisted supra, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \nand FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,10 I conclude none of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable or partially \napplicable. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has \nmitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is \nnot eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n10  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)).

Applicant is 30 years old (Tr. 5).4 He received a high school Graduate Equivalency Diploma (GED) in 1994 (Tr. 5). He attended community college for about two years off and on from 2003 to 2008 (Tr. 6, 28). He majored in management (Tr. 6). His grades in school are excellent (Tr. 28).

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old (Tr. 5).4 He received a high school Graduate \nEquivalency Diploma (GED) in 1994 (Tr. 5). He attended community college for about \ntwo years off and on from 2003 to 2008 (Tr. 6, 28). He majored in management (Tr. 6). \nHis grades in school are excellent (Tr. 28). He married in April 2004 (Tr. 18). He has a \n12-year-old step daughter, and a son, who was born in July 2005 (Tr. 19). He does not \ncurrently hold a security clearance (Tr. 38). He does not have any prior military service. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nIn 1994, Applicant was found guilty of two misdemeanors. On August 16, 1994, \nhe was found guilty of driving 74 miles per hour (mph) in a 55 mph zone on July 1, \n1994, and sentenced to a fine (SOR \u00b6 1.a, GE 3 at 1, GE 9). On December 1, 1994, he \nwas found guilty of driving 95 mph in a 55 mph zone on September 5, 1994, and \nsentenced to 10 days in jail (SOR \u00b6 1.b, GE 3 at 2, GE 9). \n \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GEs 2 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 9 (Response to \nSOR) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated Jan. 24, 2007, will \nbe referred to as a security clearance application in this decision). GE 1 is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, and the next paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nIn 1995, Applicant was found guilty of one misdemeanor. On June 26, 1995, he \nwas found guilty of improper driving on June 13, 1995, and sentenced to a fine (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c, GE 3 at 4, GE 9). \n  \nIn 1997, Applicant was found guilty of one felony and misdemeanor. On April 17, \n1997, he was found guilty of unlawful wounding on or about September 8, 1996, and \nsentenced to five years in the state penitentiary (suspended), and placed on supervised \nprobation for five years (SOR \u00b6 1.d, GE 9). On July 21, 1997, the court found him guilty \nof improper driving on June 8, 1997, and sentenced to a fine (SOR \u00b6 1.e, GE 3 at 7, GE \n9). \n \nIn 1998, Applicant was found guilty of one misdemeanor. On August 10, 1998, he \nwas found guilty of public intoxication on July 8, 1998, and sentenced to a fine (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f, GE 4 at 1, GE 9). \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was found guilty of one misdemeanor. On August 27, 2001, he \nwas found guilty of being drunk in public on July 16, 2001, and sentenced to a fine \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g, GE 4 at 4, GE 9).  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was found guilty of one misdemeanor. On March 29, 2002, he \nwas found guilty of driving while intoxicated (DWI) on October 23, 2001 (GE 4 at 5, GE \n9, SOR \u00b6 1.h). He sentenced to pay a fine and his license was suspended for one year. \nId. \n \nOn December 12, 2002, Applicant was arrested for several traffic offenses and \nDWI 2nd offense within five years (SOR \u00b6 1.i, GE 4 at 8-13, GE 9). His blood alcohol \nwas over the legal limit for alcohol. On February 28, 2003, all charges were nolle \nprossed.  Id.  \n \nOn September 14, 2003, Applicant was arrested for several traffic offenses and \nDWI (SOR \u00b6 1.j, GE 4 at 14-16, GE 9). On December 12, 2003, he was convicted of \nDWI 2nd offense within five years, and sentenced to a $500 fine, court costs of $209, six \nmonths in jail (five months and 25 days suspended), and his license was suspended for \nthree years.  Id.  \n \nIn his SOR response, dated July 22, 2008, Applicant said 95% of his offenses \nwere alcohol-related (GE 9).  He said he no longer consumes alcohol, which he belived \nwas the source of his past behavior problems (GE 9).   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nOn February 22, 1999, Applicant was charged with No Seat Belt, a traffic \ninfraction (SOR \u00b6 2.a, GE 4 at 2, GE 9). On March 17, 1999, the court found him guilty, \nand fined him $25. Id.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nOn July 12, 2000, Applicant was charged with Failure to Stop Prior to Entering \nRoadway, a traffic infraction (SOR \u00b6 2.b, GE 4 at 2, GE 9). On August 3, 2000, the court \nfound him guilty, and fined him $30. Id.  \n \nOn August 19, 2005, Applicant was charged with Speeding, a traffic infraction \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c, GE 4 at 17, GE 9). On September 13, 2005, the court found him guilty, and \nfined him $75, and required payment of $56 for court costs. Id.  \n \nOn April 19, 2006, Applicant was charged with Speeding, a traffic infraction (SOR \n\u00b6 2.d, GE 4 at 18, GE 9). On September 13, 2005, the court found him guilty, and fined \nhim $85 and required payment of $56 for court costs. Id. SOR \u00b6 2.e noted a security \nconcern related to the criminal conduct above. His 2006 arrest was his most recent \narrest (Tr. 19).  He did not contest the accuracy of his arrests, tickets and convictions \n(GE 9, Tr. 34-35). \n \nApplicant has been fully candid about his offenses as listed in this section and \nthe preceding section, Criminal Conduct (GE 9). He disclosed his alcohol-related \noffenses on his January 24, 2007, security clearance application (GE 1). \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAn alcohol-related security concern was noted in SOR \u00b6 3.a because of the \ncriminal offenses outlined in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f to 1.j above.  Applicant was convicted of four \nalcohol-related offenses: (1) public intoxication on July 8, 1998; (2) drunk in public on \nJuly 16, 2001; (3) DWI on October 23, 2001; and (4) DWI 2nd Offense on September 14, \n2003. On December 12, 2002, Applicant was arrested for DWI and his blood alcohol \nwas over the legal limit for alcohol. However, this offense was nolle prossed.   \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol when he was 15 or 16 (Tr. 29). He attended \nan alcohol safety program in 2001 (Tr. 31). The 2001 program focused on awareness of \nthe problems that could be caused by alcohol use (Tr. 31). He was referred to alcohol \ntreatment after his September 14, 2003, arrest and received 26 weeks of outpatient \nsubstance abuse treatment from March 15, 2004, to September 28, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 3.b, \nGE 5, 9, Tr. 23-25, 32). He received a prognosis of \u201cfair-to-good\u201d and a diagnosis of \n303.90 Alcohol Dependence in Early Remission. Id.  The letter providing the prognosis \nand diagnosis was signed by a case manager with \u201cMAC\u201d and \u201cNCC\u201d next to her name, \napparently indicating she is a \u201cMaster Addiction Counselor\u201d and a \u201cNationally Certified \nCounselor.\u201d Applicant was not aware of the alcohol dependence diagnosis until 2008 \n(Tr. 23). He has not received any alcohol counseling after 2004 (35). \n \nApplicant attended hundreds of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) classes (Tr. 25). \nHowever, he did not have an AA sponsor (Tr. 26). He monitored his alcohol \nconsumption from 2004 to 2008, and limited it to low levels (Tr. 24-25). He \u201csparingly \nconsumed alcohol\u201d about once every two weeks from March 2008 until July 2008, when \nhe stopped drinking alcohol altogether (Tr. 20). Previously, he successfully abstained \nfrom alcohol consumption for up to about six months back in 1998 or 1999 (Tr. 20-22). \nHe did not agree that he was dependent on alcohol (Tr. 27). He denied that he was an \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nalcoholic and that he currently abused alcohol (Tr. 36). His wife had to drive Applicant \nbecause he did not have a driver\u2019s license, and she was anxious for him to complete the \nclasses and attend AA meetings (Tr. 27). Even though he associates with people who \ndrink alcohol, he does not drink alcohol himself (Tr. 28-29).  Sometimes he does not \nattend a party, if he knows alcohol is being consumed (Tr. 29). He currently has a valid \ndriver\u2019s license without driving restrictions (Tr. 29). \n \nApplicant recognized the importance of controlling his alcohol consumption for \nthe sake of his family and his career with a government contractor (Tr. 25). The security \nclearance process has really \u201copened [his] eyes\u201d about alcohol consumption issues (Tr. \n33-34, 41). He emphasized that since 2004 he had married, no longer associated with \nthe alcohol-drinking single crowd, and had better judgment (Tr. 36-37. In July 2008, he \nrecognized that he did not need to consume alcohol and he wanted to change his life \nand future prospects for the better (Tr. 34, 41). \n \nRecommendations  \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s supervisors and a co-worker at his current employment \nprovided three letters supporting reinstatement of his clearance (AE A-C). They have \nknown Applicant for about five years. They describe Applicant as a valuable member of \nthe firm with a solid work ethic, leadership, willingness to learn and integrity. His \ncontributions to his company have been numerous and valuable. His work is always \nprofessional. He is dependable, generous, honest, trustworthy, loyal and helpful. He \nloves his family and his friends and respects others in the community.  \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.5 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \n \n5 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6\u201fThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), E (Personal Conduct) and G (alcohol \nconsumption) with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j (except for 1.i) are \nestablished. Applicant was convicted of eight misdemeanors and one felony. He \nadmitted all offenses.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to the offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j. \nFour of the criminal offenses are alcohol-related, and others may be alcohol-related. In \nhis SOR response, Applicant said 95% of his offenses were alcohol related (GE 9). \nThere is still a risk that Applicant will return to alcohol abuse and that more offenses will \noccur. See Discussion in Alcohol Consumption Section, infra. There are some positive \nsigns of rehabilitation. He admitted his misconduct and has no criminal offenses after \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nSeptember 13, 2003, which is over five years ago. He is now married, has a family, and \nhas performed well at his employment. He has stopped associating with his single \nfriends, reducing the associations that enabled and facilitated his alcohol abuse. He \ncompleted his probation, paid his fines and court costs, and his driver\u2019s license is fully \nrestored. He has demonstrated remorse and been substantially reformed. He received \njob training and has a good employment record. There is a sufficient evidentiary record \nin this case of his rehabilitation to merit a clearance eventually, provided his good \nbehavior and alcohol abstinent behavior continue.  \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior .  .  .  .  ; and (3) a pattern \nof .  .  .  rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.d allege four traffic violations in 1999, 2000, 2005 and 2006. SOR \n\u00b6 2.e re-alleges all of the criminal offenses in SOR \u00b6 1 discussed above as personal \nconduct security concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(1), 16(d)(3) and 16(e)(1) all apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n*  *  * \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(c) mitigates SOR \u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.d because his four traffic violations in 1999, \n2000, 2005 and 2006 are relatively minor. They resulted in fines of $25, $35, $75, and \n$85. They are infrequent.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e lists alcohol-related criminal offenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(g) all \napply in part. These criminal offenses cannot be mitigated for the reasons stated in the \nnext section. See Discussion in Alcohol Consumption Section, infra. There is still a risk \nthat Applicant will return to alcohol abuse and that more alcohol-related offenses will \noccur. There are some positive signs of rehabilitation. He admitted his misconduct and \nhas no criminal offenses after September 13, 2003, which is over five years ago. He is \nnow married, has a family, and has performed well at his employment. He has stopped \nassociating with his single friends, reducing the associations that enabled and facilitated \nhis alcohol abuse. See AG \u00b6 16(g). He completed his probation, paid his fines and court \ncosts, and his driver\u2019s license is fully restored. He has demonstrated remorse and been \nsubstantially reformed. He received job training and has a good employment record.  \nThere is a solid evidentiary record in this case of his rehabilitation. Most importantly, AG \n\u00b6 17(e) fully applies. He disclosed his alcohol-related offenses on his January 24, 2007, \nsecurity clearance application (GE 1). His security manager is well aware of his alcohol-\nrelated problems. Disclosure has eliminated his \u201cvulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), 22(f) and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not \nhave any alcohol-related incidents at work. Currently, he does not habitually consume \nor engage in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. Binge \ndrinking is not defined in the Directive and is not established. A qualified medical \nprofessional or licensed clinical social worker did not determine Applicant had an \nalcohol abuse or dependence problem. He did not fail to follow any court orders \nregarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment or abstinence. Although he received \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nan alcohol evaluation from an addiction counselor, this credential does not meet the \nrequirements of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) or 22(e). He received counseling in an \u201calcohol safety \nprogram\u201d in 2001 and admitted he subsequently had a relapse; however, there is \ninsufficient evidence that this was \u201can alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d Additionally, the \noutpatient alcohol treatment program he received in 2004 did not result in advice to \nabstain from alcohol consumption.  It would be unfair to require abstention when he was \nnot told it was required. \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies. Applicant was convicted of two DWIs, drunk in public and \npublic intoxication.   \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) applies in part because Applicant had only four documented alcohol-\nrelated incidents between 1998 and 2003 that had an adverse effect on his life. He was \nconvicted of two DWIs, drunk in public and public intoxication. These four events \nconsidered in isolation are somewhat infrequent or isolated, and not recent. He does not \ndrink alcohol and drive, and accordingly he receives some credit because, \u201cit happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a), \ncannot be fully applied because he continued to consume alcohol up until July 2008. \nAdditionally, he admitted returning to alcohol consumption after previously abstaining \nfrom alcohol consumption for up to six months. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not acknowledge being \nalcohol dependent or being an alcoholic. He is minimizing his alcohol consumption \nproblem. Although he completed an alcohol abuse treatment program in 2004, he \nstopped attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and does not currently attend any \nother alcohol treatment program. He stopped consuming alcohol in July 2008 just about \ntwo months before his hearing. He did not fully recognize that his alcohol problem raises \nsecurity concerns until too recently to receive full mitigating credit.  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of more substantial \nalcohol abuse than Applicant\u2019s that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless \nthere was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR \nCase No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).  For \nexample, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant \ncontinued to drink even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s \napplication of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in \n2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol \n(not to intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued \nalcohol consumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary \nand capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) \n(involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and \nreversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption, I conclude his continued alcohol consumption up until July 2008 is simply \ntoo recent to mitigate all alcohol consumption security concerns.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of his clearance. Applicant \nrevealed his alcohol-related offenses on his security clearance application, in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, and at his hearing. He does not associate with his \nalcohol consuming friends. Now that he is married, has a family and is in the workforce, \nthe consequences of alcohol abuse will be more severe. He has avoided alcohol-related \ncriminal offenses for five years. He completed an alcohol safety program in 2001, an \nalcohol treatment program in 2004, and received the benefit of \u201chundreds\u201d of Alcoholics \nAnonymous sessions. His prognosis from the 2004 alcohol treatment program was \u201cfair-\nto-good.\u201d Applicant is a valued employee with excellent potential. There is no evidence \nat his current employment of any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of \ndisloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His law-abiding \ncharacter and good work performance over the last five years show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation and mitigation. His co-workers and supervisors support approval of his \nclearance. I am satisfied that his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and his \ncurrent ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations shows future \npotential for access to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a substantial problem with alcohol abuse and/or dependence for many \nyears. He has four alcohol-related involvements with law enforcement resulting in \ncriminal convictions. Nevertheless, he continued to drink alcohol up until July 2008. His \ndecisions to engage in criminal conduct after consuming alcohol to intoxication were \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. Excessive alcohol consumption shows a lack of judgment \nand/or impulse control. His problems with alcohol cannot be mitigated at this time. Such \nconduct raises a serious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at \nthis time. However, if Applicant can continue to abstain from alcohol consumption for \nanother year, he will have shown sufficient judgment and self-control to warrant \nfavorable consideration for access to classified information.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to personal conduct, but not criminal conduct or alcohol \nconsumption.    \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \n                                            \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. On August 12,\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nFebruary 9, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

The case was\nassigned to me on November 13, 2008, and I convened a hearing on December 17,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx.\n1 - 3). Applicant testified and presented one witness. She also submitted six exhibits\n(Ax. A - F). Additionally, I have included a single-page document in the record as\nJudicial Exhibit (Jx.) I. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on December 29,\n2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $51,904\nfor the balance on a foreclosed $259,543 mortgage. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The government also\nalleged she \u201cfailed to candidly answer the Financial Interrogatories mailed to [her] and\nto provide complete and detailed answers including a personal financial statement as\nrequested by the Government detailing [her] financial status and [her] ability to pay [her]\ndebts and household expenses as they come due.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.a)  In response, Applicant\ndenied all of the SOR allegations and provided with her answer information about the\nSOR \u00b6 1.a allegation. After reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and the parties\u2019\nexhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 30 years old and has been employed by a large defense contractor\nsince June 2001. She has held several different positions with her employer, and she\nhas moved three times (from Virginia to Georgia in July 2002; from Georgia to Florida in\nMay 2005; from Florida back to Georgia in October 2006). Applicant attended college\nfrom August 1997 until May 2001, when she received a B.S. in Computer Science. She\nis currently working on her M.S. in Computer Science. Between January 2000 and June\n2000, Applicant worked as a college intern for her current employer. Her most recent\nperformance appraisal reflects excellent work and potential for continued advancement\nin a demanding environment. (Gx. 1; Tr. 6)\nApplicant presented her mother as a witness. She testified that, in December\n2002, she answered a newspaper ad, which presented an opportunity to buy five\ntownhouses she could own as rental properties. (Tr. 57) The ad offered owner\nfinancing, which was attractive to her because she would not have to qualify for a loan.\nIn February 2003, Applicant\u2019s mother entered into an agreement to buy the properties\nfrom a married couple to whom Applicant\u2019s mother was to make payments directly.  She\n3\nmade payments as agreed for three months. Thereafter, she was contacted by the bank\ncreditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a and was informed they now held the mortgage on her\n\n3\ntownhouses. She then sent her payments to the bank as required. Applicant\u2019s mother\nwas soon unable to rent the properties for a variety of reasons. The properties were\nlocated in a bad neighborhood which would not support the rent she needed to charge.\nAlso, some of the properties were damaged by storms that rendered them uninhabitable\nfor a long periods of time. Concurrently, she was unable to refinance due to falling\nproperty values and soon ran out of funds to pay the mortgages. The properties went to\nforeclosure and were sold at auction in June 2005. According to Applicant\u2019s mother, the\nproperties were sold for at least what was owed in arrears. (Tr. 64) For tax purposes,\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was notified the properties had been abandoned or\nacquired by another party and that the debts were cancelled. The resulting benefit to\nApplicant\u2019s mother became taxable income for the 2005 tax year. (Tr. 35 - 43; Ax. A;\nGx. 3; Answer to SOR)\nWhen Applicant\u2019s mother entered into the agreement to purchase the\ntownhouses, the sellers required a co-signer to guarantee performance on the\nobligations. Applicant\u2019s mother signed Applicant\u2019s name to the contracts without\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge or permission. (Jx. I) She did not inform Applicant of her plans to\nbuy the townhouses. Applicant only became aware of her mother\u2019s ownership of rental\nproperties sometime after the deal was done. (Ax. A; Tr. 37, 50 - 51, 81, 97 - 98) As a\nresult of her mother\u2019s actions, the loans and, ultimately, their delinquent status were\nreported in Applicant\u2019s credit history. The tax effects of the debt cancellation also\naffected Applicant\u2019s income tax reporting requirements for 2005. However, Applicant\u2019s\nmother is the only party with a remaining IRS obligation. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 3; Tr.  It\nis unclear how Applicant\u2019s personal information (e.g., her social security number,\naddress, employer, etc.) was obtained by the creditor, as both Applicant and her mother\ndenied having provided it to anyone as part of this transaction. (Tr. 54, 82)\nWhile Applicant became aware her mother had purchased rental properties soon\nafter the transactions, she was not aware her mother had obligated her as a co-signer\nto the mortgages. In 2004, Applicant was turned down for a personal loan when a credit\ncheck showed she was in default on five mortgages. Her mother told her what\nhappened only when Applicant confronted her about the matter. (Tr. 44, 70) Applicant\nhas disputed the information in her credit report about the defaulted mortgages. She\nalso obtained information from the creditor showing she was no longer listed on three of\nthe accounts. (Attachments to SOR Answer; Tr. 75 - 77)\nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2001. In October 2006, during in-\nprocessing at her current job site, she spoke with the local Facility Security Officer\n(FSO) about a variety of topics related to her suitability for access to classified\ninformation. She disclosed the adverse information about her mother\u2019s actions and their\nimpact on her credit. In April 2007, she submitted an e-QIP for a periodic update of her\nclearance. She disclosed the fact she was listed as a co-signer on delinquent properties\nher mother had acquired. (Gx. 1) In November 2007, her FSO came to her and\nsuggested Applicant provide more detailed information about what had happened. She\nsubsequently included with her e-QIP a letter explaining what had happened. (Gx. 1; Tr.\n70 - 72; Ax. A)\n\n No summary or other record of that interview was produced.\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n4\nA few months later, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout information in her background. The adverse information about the defaulted\nmortgages on her credit report was discussed. (Tr. 72 - 73)  In April 2008, after\n4\nreviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, a DOHA adjudicator sent\nto Applicant written interrogatories seeking additional information about one of her\nmother\u2019s defaulted mortgage accounts in the amount of $51,904 attributed to Applicant\nin a credit report obtained by government investigators. \nApplicant insists she timely responded to the interrogatories as required, but she\ndid not retain a copy of her response. In support of her claim, she points to Gx. 2, which\nconsists of documents sent to her by the IRS in May 2008. She asserted that  she sent\nin response to the interrogatories those IRS documents, as well as other documents,\nwhich she also attached to her SOR Answer. She also claimed she spoke by telephone\nwith the adjudicator handling her case seeking guidance about what she needed to\nsubmit. (Tr. 73 - 87) Applicant also testified she spoke with the adjudicator after the\nSOR was issued, and that the adjudicator acknowledged at that time having received\nher response to the interrogatories. (Tr. 100 - 101) In support of the SOR allegation that\nApplicant \u201cfailed to candidly answer the Financial Interrogatories mailed to [her],\u201d the\ngovernment submitted a blank version of the interrogatory. (Gx. 2) However, it was also\nuncontested that the information in Gx. 3 was received from the Applicant as part of her\nresponse to interrogatories. (Tr. 22 - 24, 92 - 93) Accordingly, I find as fact that the\nApplicant responded to the interrogatories sent to her by a DOHA adjudicator.\nAside from the adverse effect of her mother\u2019s actions on her credit rating,\nApplicant\u2019s finances are sound. She has been financially independent since high school\n(Tr. 44 - 45), relying on student loans to fund her college and post-graduate education.\nAvailable information (Gx. 4 and Ax. D) shows she has payed those loans as agreed.\nWhile her credit history also reflects occasional credit problems in the past 10 years,\nthose  appear to have been resolved satisfactorily. Applicant is a two-time homeowner\nand has a modest positive monthly cashflow, but her expenses include repayment of\ncredit obligations, all of which are current. (Ax. C) Finally, she has been proactive in her\nefforts to resolve her mother\u2019s malfeasance (Tr. 74 - 77; Attachments to SOR Answer).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial\nConsiderations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\n\n6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a. Information obtained during the most recent investigation of her suitability for\naccess to classified information showed there was a delinquent mortgage account\ntotaling $51,904 attributable to Applicant. The information also showed the account was\ndelinquent as of 2005 and was still unpaid as of June 2007. Accordingly, the record\nrequires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).\nIn response, Applicant presented sufficient information to show the debt was not\nhers. She also presented sufficient information (her mother\u2019s testimony, the documents\nattached to her answer to the SOR, and the documents in Gx. 3, which were submitted\nin response to the DOHA interrogatories) to show that the debt in \u00b6 SOR 1.a is being\nresolved and that there is a legitimate dispute about the debt. Further, the record shows\nthat Applicant lives well within her means and has not engaged in irresponsible\nspending or excessive use of her personal credit. Her current credit history contains no\nother adverse entries; to the contrary, it reflects a sound use of personal credit and of\npaying her debts. The foregoing supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG\n\u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) (emphasis\nadded), AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) (emphasis added), and AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). On balance, Applicant presented\navailable information sufficient to show she is unlikely to act contrary to the national\ninterest to get money to repay the alleged debt. Available information is sufficient to\nmitigate the alleged security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in AG \u00b6\n15, is\n\n As contemplated by DOHA Operating Instruction (OI) 18, Section 4.4 (Written Interrogatories) and Section\n9\n4.5 (Second Chance).\n7\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nApplicant denied the SOR \u00b6 2.a allegation that she had \u201cfailed to candidly answer\nthe Financial Interrogatories mailed to [her] and to provide complete and detailed\nanswers including a personal financial statement as requested by the Government\ndetailing [her] financial status and [her] ability to pay [her] debts and household\nexpenses as they come due.\u201d Accordingly, the burden was on the government to\npresent sufficient credible information to prove that allegation. (Directive, E3.1.14)\nFailure to respond to the interrogatories would have required application of the\nadjudicative factor at AG \u00b6 15(b) (refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to\nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination). It may also be\ndisqualifying if Applicant deliberately falsified any statement she made to the\ngovernment regarding relevant and material information about her suitability to hold a\nclearance. (AG \u00b616(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities); AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative).\nAt the beginning of the hearing, I asked Department Counsel if the SOR \u00b6 2.a\nallegation was that Applicant did not respond to the interrogatories or that her answer\nwas untruthful. Department Counsel stated that it was both - that Applicant had failed to\nanswer the interrogatory and that her non-answer was untruthful. (Tr. 20 - 22) Intuitively,\nthis makes no sense. It is not possible to falsify a statement that has not been made.\nThe allegation is also flawed, because it does not specify what information was false.\nFor example, there is no allegation that Applicant stated one thing during her\nbackground investigation but either failed to disclose that information or gave an\ninconsistent version in response to the government\u2019s interrogatories. Nonetheless, the\nweight of the government\u2019s own information bearing on the issue of whether Applicant\nresponded to the interrogatories (Gx. 3 and the testimony at Tr. 22 - 24) shows she did\ncomply with the government\u2019s request for information. The government\u2019s reliance on\nGx. 2 (a blank version of the interrogatory purported to have been issued to Applicant)\nis not conclusive of anything, while it is uncontested that the contents of Gx. 3 were part\nof her response to the interrogatories. Assuming (solely for the purpose of discussion)\nthat Applicant did not respond to the interrogatories, there is no indication that DOHA\nadjudicators contacted Applicant or her employer to indicate that processing of her\nclearance could be terminated.9\n\n8\nAs to whether what was submitted was truthful, the government did not present\nany information that showed what Applicant submitted in connection with this matter\nwas false or misleading. To the contrary, available information, including Applicant\u2019s\ncredible testimony (Tr. 73 - 74) about her interactions with the DOHA adjudicator as\nApplicant was preparing her response, shows Applicant has readily and candidly\ndisclosed the adverse information at each stage of the re-investigation of her clearance.\nShe had even disclosed that information to her FSO before she filled out her e-QIP (Gx.\n1) It is unlikely, therefore, that she would suddenly decide not to comply with a request\nfor adverse information she had already disclosed to her employer and had discussed\nwith a government investigator during her background investigation. On balance, I\nconclude the government failed to establish either that Applicant did not respond or that\nshe has made any false statements about her finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 30 years old and is a\nmature, responsible adult. She is a successful, independent single mother who put\nherself through school, has been paying off her student loans as required since 2001,\nand who shows potential for continued advancement with the company where she has\nworked for nearly eight years. She has been candid and forthcoming about her finances\nat all stages of this matter, and there has been no misconduct on her part. A fair and\ncommonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security concerns raised by\ninformation showing Applicant may have owed one debt has been refuted. Her finances\ndo not put her at risk of acting contrary to the national interest, and the stated concerns\nabout her personal conduct were unfounded. Any doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information have been satisfied.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance is\ngranted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mardula, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer, requesting a hearing before an\nadministrative judge, on April 4, 2008. I received the case assignment on June 10,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 18, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on July 10, 2008. During the hearing, I received six government exhibits,\nmarked and identified as Exhibits 1 through 4, and Exhibits 6 through 7 (Exhibit 5 was\nnot admitted.), and three Applicant exhibits, marked and identified as Exhibits A through\nC. Also, at the government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the facts listed in six\nAugust 14, 2008\n\n2\nsource documents concerning the People\u2019s Republic of China. Based upon a review of\nthe record evidence, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man with three children, ages 15, 10, and 8.\nHe and his wife are natives of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). He earned a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in physics from a university in PRC in 1988. Shortly afterwards, he\nreceived a scholarship from an American university. In 1990, he moved here and began\nattending the university that awarded him the scholarship. In 1992, he earned a\nmaster\u2019s degree in art and mathematics (Tr. 35), and in 1996, he earned a master\u2019s\ndegree and a Ph.D in electrical engineering from another U.S. university (Tr. 35). \nCurrently, Applicant works for a contractor performing modeling simulation and\nsystem engineering for a government agency\u2019s network. According to his supervisor, he\nis a highly competent, conscientious employee (Tr. 20-22).\nApplicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2006. They were\nmarried in PRC in 1988. All of their children were born in the U.S. Applicant has a sister\nwho lives in Australia. Another sister passed away in 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a PRC citizen and resident. She worked as a physician in\nthe health division of the Beijing Foreign Affairs University before retiring in 1990 (Tr.\n47, Ex. A at 2). His father worked as a property manager before his death in 2002 (Tr.\n52, 59).\nIn 2005, Applicant talks with his mother frequently in an effort to help her cope\nwith the death of her husband and daughter. As she recovered, Applicant\u2019s\ncommunications began to decrease (Tr. 48). Currently, they communicate\napproximately two or three times per month (Tr. 58). He does not support her financially\n(Tr. 61). \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a retired professor, and his mother-in-law is a retired\npediatrician (Tr. 44). Both worked at the Beijing Foreign Affairs University and retired\nmore than 15 years ago (Exhibit A at 1, 3, Exhibit B). During the PRC\u2019s Cultural\nRevolution, they were accused of being \u201canti-revolutionary\u201d and exiled to a remote area\nof the country for more than 10 years (Tr. 46). During this era, Applicant\u2019s mother also\nexperienced some persecution, but it was not severe as the persecution experienced by\nhis in-laws (Tr. 47).\nApplicant\u2019s in-laws traveled to the U.S. to visit his family in 2002, staying for two\nmonths (Tr. 60). Since then, they have drifted apart. Currently, neither Applicant nor his\nwife has a close relationship with them (Tr. 60). He does not speak with them, and his\nwife speaks with them rarely (Tr. 59).\n\nShe refused, citing health concerns that prohibited lengthy travel.\n1\n3\nIn 2005, Applicant paid $120,000 USD for the purchase a condominium in Beijing\n(Tr. 48). He leases it to a tenant who pays him $600 USD per month in rent (Tr. 57). His\nbrother-in-law manages the property. Applicant does not pay any property taxes to the\nPRC on the condominium (Tr. 58). Since approximately May 2008, he has been\nattempting to sell it (Exhibit C).\nApplicant\u2019s primary residence in the U.S. is worth approximately $800,000. He\nhas a stock portfolio worth approximately $100,000, and has $10,000 invested in a\n401k.\nSince 2002, Applicant has traveled to PRC five times. In 2002, he attended his\nfather\u2019s funeral, staying for five days (Tr. 52). In 2004, he visited his sister, shortly after\nshe was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned the following year when she died\n(Tr. 53). In 2006, he visited his mother to persuade her to return with him to the U.S.1\nMost recently, he visited in 2007 (Tr. 63). Accompanied by his family, he visited both his\nmother and his parents in-laws (Tr. 64). Each of the trips, other then the 2002 one,\nlasted approximately three weeks.\nThe PRC is a totalitarian state with a large and diverse intelligence infrastructure\nin the United States (Exhibit VI at 1, Exhibit II at 28). It seeks to collect both military and\nindustrial information with the dual purpose of making the Chinese military-industrial\nbase more sophisticated, and the economy more competitive. (Exhibit II at 24; Exhibit I\nat 24). U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials rate the PRC\u2019s espionage\nand industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology\n(Exhibit III at 104). \nThe PRC continues to abuse human rights in violation of internationally\nrecognized norms (Exhibit I at 9). Local police can unilaterally detain suspects for up to\n37 days before releasing them or placing them under arrest (Exhibit V at 5). The PRC\nroutinely monitors its citizens\u2019 communications (Exhibit 6 at 9). PRC security personnel\nmay sometimes place foreign visitors under surveillance, monitoring hotel rooms,\ntelephones, and fax machines (Exhibit 5 at 2, \u00b6 8).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests.\u201d Here,\nthe presence of Applicant\u2019s family members in the PRC, a totalitarian country with an\naggressive intelligence-gathering apparatus, and a history of human rights abuses,\ngenerates a security concern under AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, or coercion.\u201d Similarly, Applicant\u2019s ownership of a\ncondominium in PRC triggers the application of AG \u00b6 7(e), \u201ca substantial business,\nfinancial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Because of the nature of the PRC\u2019s government, Applicant\nbears a heavy burden in seeking to mitigate these security risks.\n\n5\nNeither Applicant\u2019s mother nor his in-laws currently work at the Beijing Foreign\nAffairs University. Consequently, I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.d in his favor. Their\nretiree status does not minimize Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, however.\nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for approximately 18 years, and his entire\nimmediate family are U.S. citizens and residents. Since living in the U.S., he has\ndeveloped a successful career, and is respected by his professional acquaintances. His\nstrong sense of loyalty to the U.S. and his longstanding relationships and contacts in the\nU.S. are not enough to outweigh the vulnerability to coercion created by his familial\nobligation to his mother. None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nApplicant\u2019s sense of familial obligation to his mother and his concern for her well-\nbeing are positive attributes. However, positive attributes can generate security\nconcerns as readily as negative ones. Here, the PRC is a large, powerful country intent\non enhancing its military and economic power by any means necessary. Under these\ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion is compounded, rendering him an\nunacceptable security risk.\nAlthough Applicant is not close to his in-laws, there is a rebuttable presumption\nthat he could be subject to coercion from them through his spouse (ISCR Case No. 01-\n03120 (February 20, 2002) at 4). His in-laws visited his family for two months in the U.S.\napproximately six years ago. Applicant and his family visited them in the PRC\napproximately six months ago. He has not rebutted the presumption, and none of the\nmitigating conditions apply to these relationships either.\nApplicant\u2019s PRC investment property is minimal in relation to his U.S. financial\ninterests. Also, he is in the process of selling it. AG \u00b6 8(f), the value or routine nature of\nthe foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to\nresult in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure the individual.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\n6\nUpon evaluating the whole person factors, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s application\nfor a security clearance must be denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d-1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 12, 2007. On \nMay 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines G and J. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 2, 2008; answered it on \nJune 9; 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed on July 10, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on \nJuly 29, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 29, 2008, scheduling the \nhearing for August 26, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through J, which were admitted without objection. The \nrecord closed upon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 11, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the facts alleged in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old chemical engineer for a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since October 2004. He has never held a security \nclearance.  \n \n \nApplicant first consumed alcohol at age 13, when he consumed three or four \nbeers and became intoxicated. Two or three months later, he drank to the point of \nintoxication and became very ill. After that occasion, he abstained from drinking until \nage 18 (AX A at 4). He told a security investigator that he consumed 10-12 drinks every \nweekend while in college. He remembers blacking out eight to ten times (GX 6 at 5).  \n \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), \na misdemeanor, after a breathalyzer test indicated a blood-alcohol level of .13%. He \nwas convicted of driving while impaired, a lesser offense, and was fined. In January \n2003, he enrolled in a three-day inpatient treatment program and was diagnosed as an \nalcoholic. The medical credentials of the person who diagnosed him are not reflected in \nthe record (GX 6 at 1-2).  \n \n \nIn September 2004, Applicant was charged with DWI, driving with a blood-\nalcohol level of .08%, and speeding. His blood-alcohol level was about .16%. He was \nfined and placed on supervised probation. He was released from probation after about \n18 months (Tr. 57). Pursuant to a court order, he attended an addiction recovery center \nand participated in outpatient group counseling from October 2004 to March 2005. He \nwas diagnosed as an alcoholic by a state credentialed alcoholism and substance abuse \ncounselor (AX A at 5; AX C).  \n \n \nAfter completing treatment at the addiction recovery center, he abstained from \nconsuming alcohol for about 18 months. He avoided contact with his former drinking \nfriends and avoided locations associated with drinking. He did not join any support \ngroups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) (AX A at 5). He relapsed once in February \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2006, consuming seven to nine drinks, and he lied to his probation officer about it (AX A \nat 8). \n \n \nAfter about 18 months, Applicant decided he could manage his alcohol \nconsumption. He wanted to associate with his old friends and enjoy their \ncompanionship. He \u201cno longer had any outside influence such as probation or outpatient \ntreatment\u201d to remind him of the consequences of his alcohol use (AX A at 5; Tr. 60). He \nbegan drinking to the point of intoxication once or twice a week (Tr. 93). \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant was charged with felony DWI, driving with a blood-\nalcohol level of .08%, and speeding. His blood-alcohol level was about .16%. In \nNovember 2006, while these charges were pending, he voluntarily enrolled in an \noutpatient substance abuse treatment program, and he successfully completed it in May \n2007. He was again diagnosed as an alcoholic by a credentialed alcoholism and \nsubstance abuse counselor. In accordance with his counselor\u2019s recommendation, he \nbegan attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings twice a week and obtained a \nsponsor.  \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant entered pleas to the October 2006 charges, pleading \nguilty to misdemeanor DWI and speeding. A formal conviction was not entered. In \nAugust 2007, he was placed in a drug court program consisting of frequent court \nappearances, daily call-in requirements, group counseling, meetings with probation \nofficers, random urinalysis, periodic interviews with a case worker, and participation in \nAA or a similar organization (AX D). His participation agreement with the drug court \nprovided for sanctions for non-compliance, including community service and one year in \njail (GX 3 at 4; AX A at 7). In September 2007, he told a security investigator that he \nbelieved he was once physically dependent on alcohol, but as of the date of the \ninterview he believed he was no longer alcohol dependent (GX 6 at 5). On August 4, \n2008, he successfully completed the drug court program, with no relapses or instances \nof non-compliance (AX I). He is no longer on probation (Tr. 89). His driver\u2019s license was \nrevoked, and it will not be reinstated until he completes a seven-week course of \ninstruction administered by the department of motor vehicles (Tr. 90-91).  \n \n \nApplicant last drank to the point of intoxication in October 2006, when he was \ncharged with felony DWI. He last consumed alcohol when he took a sip of champagne \nat Thanksgiving dinner with his grandparents in November 2006 (Tr. 80). As of the date \nof the hearing, he was attending two to four AA meetings a week, meeting with his AA \nsponsor or other friends in recovery at least once a week, and serving as treasurer and \nmeeting host for his group (AX A at 13; Tr. 77, 81). His current girlfriend also is a \nrecovering alcoholic (Tr. 81). Other than colleagues at work, most of his friends are also \nalcoholics in recovery (Tr. 98-99). \n \n \nIn March 2007, April 2008, and May 2008, Applicant received significant \npromotions and pay increases from his employer (AX H). He has starting exercising \nregularly. He actively participates as a volunteer in a Junior Achievement Program \nsponsored by his employer, teaching school children about business and economics \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(Tr. 71, 100-01). In July 2008, Applicant was accepted into a master\u2019s degree program, \nwith classes beginning in the fall of 2008 (AX J). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the past two years is aware of his alcohol-related \nproblems. He testified Applicant is one of the finest people he has worked with. He has \nno concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment, and he describes \nhim an exemplary employee (Tr. 105-08). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor has known Applicant for about 18 months (Tr. 117). He \ntestified Applicant is \u201cwell on his way\u201d through the steps to recovery (Tr. 115). He \nbelieves Applicant has \u201cmade some pretty substantial strides,\u201d changed his behavior, \nand stepped away from situations that could jeopardize his continued sobriety (Tr. 114-\n117). He testified there has been a \u201cdefinite transformation\u201d in the way Applicant \ninteracts at AA meetings. He believes Applicant\u2019s active participation in AA is a good \nindicator that Applicant will not go back to drinking again (Tr. 122). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with alcohol-related driving \noffenses in September 2002, September 2004, and October 2006; and that after the last \noffense he was sentenced to a drug court program (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). It also alleges \nApplicant completed one alcohol education program and two alcohol abuse treatment \nprograms (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence . . ., regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related driving \noffenses are sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c). \u201cBinge drinking\u201d is \n\u201cthe consumption of five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion.\u201d  U.S. Dept. \nof Health & Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAdministration, The  National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Binge Drinking Among \nUnderage Persons, Apr. 11, 2002, available at  http://www.oas.samhsa.gov. Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of heavy alcohol consumption raises this disqualifying condition.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised either by \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d or by \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d) and (e). Applicant was diagnosed with \nalcoholism three times. \u201cAlcoholism\u201d is \u201cchronic alcohol abuse, dependence, or \naddiction.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary at 44 (26th ed. 1995). The term \u201calcoholism\u201d \ndoes not appear in DSM IV. In previous versions of the DSM, it was synonymous with \nalcohol dependence. The credentials of the person making the first diagnosis are not \nreflected in the record. The second and third diagnoses were by a certified alcoholism \nand substance abuse counselor. The government produced no evidence of the \nqualifications for this designation, nor did it produce any evidence that such a person is \nqualified or authorized to make a medical diagnosis. I conclude AG \u00b6 22(d) and (e) are \nnot raised.  \n \nAlthough the enumerated disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and (e) are not \nraised, I have considered Applicant\u2019s admission at the hearing as well as his admission \nto a security investigator that he was alcohol dependent. These admissions are \nincorporated below in my whole person analysis. \n \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201crelapse after diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 22(f). Applicant completed a three-day inpatient treatment program in January 2003 \nand a five-month outpatient program in March 2005, and he relapsed after completing \neach program. The first element of this disqualifying condition is not met, because the \nrecord does not reflect the qualifications of the persons who diagnosed Applicant as an \nalcoholic. I have considered Applicant\u2019s admissions of alcohol dependence and the \nevidence of his two relapses in my whole person analysis. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 (a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). This mitigating \ncondition has four disjunctive prongs. The first prong of this mitigating condition focuses \non the recentness of the conduct. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when \nconduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntotality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If \nthe evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.@ Id. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcoholic drink was his sip of champagne in November 2006. His \nlast drinking binge was in October 2006, 22 months before the hearing. On its face, this \nperiod of sobriety is \u201ca significant period of time.\u201d He appears to have finally realized he \ncannot drink in moderation, and to have recognized his need for changed behavior and \na support structure. On the other hand, Applicant was constrained by the rigorous \nrequirements of the drug court program until August 4, 2008, less than a month before \nthe hearing. Under the drug court program, he faced a year in jail for non-compliance. \nHe admitted at the hearing that his relapse after 18 months of sobriety in 2006 occurred \nbecause he no longer had external constraining influences such as probation or \noutpatient treatment. I am not satisfied that his abstinence under the strictures of the \ndrug court program is sufficient to establish rehabilitation. More time is needed for him \nto demonstrate he can maintain sobriety without external constraints. Thus, I conclude \nthe first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct was frequent, not the product of unusual \ncircumstances, and raises doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. Thus, I conclude none of four prongs of AG \u00b6 23(a) are established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant has \nacknowledged his alcohol dependence and completed an alcohol treatment program, \nbut he has not yet established a \u201cpattern\u201d of abstinence that is not dependent on \nexternal constraints. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is not established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual is a \ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no \nhistory of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n23(c). Applicant\u2019s previous history of treatment and relapse precludes application of this \nmitigating condition. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(d). Applicant successfully completed the drug court program, which \n\n \n8 \n \n \napparently had no aftercare requirements; but, as noted above, he has not \ndemonstrated an established pattern of abstinence. Furthermore, there is no evidence \nof a favorable prognosis. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(d) is not established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges under this guideline the same conduct alleged under \nGuideline G. The concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca \nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related arrests alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established, for the reasons set out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 \n23(a) under Guideline G. \n \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). As noted above in the discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) under Guideline G, there \nis insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation based on passage of time. On the \nother hand, Applicant has expressed remorse, he is furthering his education, he has \nperformed well at work and received promotions, and he is actively involved in \ncommunity activities. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is partially established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. I have \nincorporated my above comments concerning Guidelines G and J in my whole person \nanalysis. \n \n \nApplicant has made great strides toward turning his life around. He was candid, \nsincere, and credible at the hearing. As of the date of the hearing, he had done \neverything he could to overcome his past and mitigate his conduct. He admits he is an \nalcoholic and cannot drink in moderation. He is on the right path. The only unanswered \nquestion is whether he can maintain sobriety without external constraints on his \nbehavior. The hearing was less than a month after he graduated from the drug court \nprogram, and more time is needed to determine whether he can maintain his sobriety \nwithout external constraints on his behavior. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.37 through E3.1.40 \n(reconsideration authorized after one year).  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines H and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 25, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on September 23, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nSeptember 30, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 29, 2008.  The Government\noffered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant offered three exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough C and testified on his own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was\nreceived on November 10, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 58 years old and has a Bachelors of Science Degree in\nAeronautical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor and holds dual\npositions as a Deputy Chief Engineering and Air Frame Chief Engineer, and is applying\nfor a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant has been employed in the defense industry since 1973.  He has\nworked for the same defense contractor, and has held a security clearance for the past\nthirty-five years.  Although he was aware of the illegality of marijuana and that his\ncompany policy and DoD prohibits its use, he began using marijuana in 1996, and\ncontinued to use it on an occasional basis, at times, two to three times per year until\n2007.  His employer is unaware of his marijuana use.          \nApplicant explained that he started using marijuana in the mid 90's when he was\ngoing through a difficult period in his life; he separated from his wife, and they\neventually divorced.  During this period, he re-entered the singles scene and associated\nwith individuals who introduced him to marijuana use.  Most of the time, he used it at\nsocial events with his friends, even though he stated that he did not really enjoy it.  His\nmost recent use of marijuana, however, occurred in his home, when old friends came to\nvisit and offered it to him.     \nIn November 2007, the Applicant met with an investigator from the Department of\nDefense, and stated that he intended to use marijuana in the future and did not see\nanything wrong with its use.  (Government Exhibit 2).  In his answer to the Statement of\nReasons, he stated, \u201cI overstated what I meant.  A better choice of words would have\nbeen that I could never say that I would never use marijuana again.  I don\u2019t\u2019 plan on\nusing it again, but one never knows.\u201d  Now, he indicates that he still did not properly\narticulate his intent.  (Tr. p. 42).  He states that he does not plan on using marijuana in\nthe future, as he now has a different circle of friends.  (Tr. p. 44).     \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nher personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Government amended the SOR at the hearing to include Guideline E and\nthe following allegation:  The Applicant intentionally falsified his Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing when he answered question 24(b).  Question 24 (b)\nasked, \u201cHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law\nenforcement officer, prosecutor or court official, while possessing a security clearance,\nwhile in a position directly or immediately affecting the public safety?\u201d  (Tr. pp. 50 -51).\nThe Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 1).\nThis was a false answer.  Applicant testified that he read the question incorrectly,\nand that he should have answered, \u201cYES\u201d.  (Tr. p. 51).  I find that the Applicant did not\nintentionally try to conceal his marijuana use from the Government on this\n\n3\nquestionnaire.  It was the Applicant, himself, who informed the government of his illicit\ndrug use when interviewed two months later.  Therefore, I do not find that he\ndeliberately concealed this information on the application, but was only careless in\nanswering the question on the questionnaire.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under\nthis guideline.      \nLetters of recommendation from the Director of Engineering and Chief Engineer;\nand the Chief Engineer and Engineering Business Area Director, both individuals who\nare professional colleagues and friends of the Applicant, attest to the Applicant\u2019s\nvaluable expertise and experience in aerospace engineering and technical design.\nFrom their experiences with him, which include many social activities outside of work in\naddition to daily contact at the company, he has always conducted himself ethically and\nconsistent with company values and behaviors and has consistently demonstrated\nresponsibility and the commitment to protect and safeguard classified information.  He is\nsaid to be conscientious, trustworthy and strives to do what is right regardless of the\nsituation.  They consider him to be extremely logical and level headed.  He is well\nrespected and known as a top performer for the company.   (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nApplicant testified that he told them about his drug use.  (Tr. p. 30). \nAnnual performance appraisals of the Applicant from 1997 through 2007 range\nfrom \u201ccommendable\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d in every category.  Written comments further\nindicate that the Applicant has consistently performed in an outstanding manner.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nThe Applicant regrets his marijuana use in the past and hopes to retain his\nsecurity clearance.  He enjoys his job, his colleagues, and being a mentor to the young\nengineers.     \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\n4\n22.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d                                              \n      \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and/or dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline H of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant used marijuana while holding a DoD\nsecurity clearance and when questioned about his future use of marijuana, found it\ndifficult to state that he would not use it in the future.  Although he now states that he\nhas no intentions of using it in the future, I am not certain that he will remain drug free.\nHe used marijuana knowing that it was prohibited by law and clearly prohibited by the\nDepartment of Defense.  This demonstrates poor judgment and untrustworthiness.  The\nApplicant is not currently eligible for a security clearance.  If he can continue to remain\n\n6\ndrug free in the future, he may be eligible for a security clearance sometime in the\nfuture, but not now.  His recent use of marijuana in 2007, absolutely prohibits a\nfavorable determination in this case.     \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  I find his past use of illegal drugs to be recent and of security\nsignificance.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, as stated above, I find that the Applicant\ndid not deliberately falsify his security clearance application.  None of the disqualifying\nconditions are applicable in this case.  Consequently, I find for the Applicant under\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 58 years old, mature,\neducated, intelligent, successful, well respected, and a long time employee of the\ndefense industry who has held a security clearance for thirty-five years.  He has used\nmarijuana, admittedly on an occasional basis, but during eleven of those thirty-five\nyears while holding a security clearance.  He last used marijuana in September 2007,\nand now states that he has no intentions of using it in the future.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed\nas a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nand/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is\nfound for the Applicant.     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  Paragraph 2 is found for the\nApplicant.                                                                                                                           \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 34 years old and has a Bachelors Degree in Business Management. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Blueprint Clerk, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph1 (Guideline I - Psychological Conditions). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because her emotional, mental and personality conditions can impair her judgment, reliability or trustworthiness and her ability to properly protect classified information. The Applicant admits allegations 1(a) and 1(c) and denies allegations 1(b) and 1 (d) set forth in the SOR under this guideline. With respect to the allegations she denied, she provided no explanation. Applicant began working for a major defense contractor in September 2006. She has been on medical disability for her mental condition since August 2008. Medical records of the Applicant from 2005 to 2006, indicate that she received a mental health evaluation by a family practice physician in the Behavior Health/Addictive Behavior Department of a hospital.

(Government Exhibit 1).  On June 10, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as\namended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on June 23, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on July 31, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 12, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for September 23, 2009.  At the hearing the Government called\none witness and presented seven exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 through 7.\nThe Applicant presented no exhibits, but did testify on her own behalf.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on October 5, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 34 years old and has a Bachelors Degree in Business\nManagement.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Blueprint Clerk, and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph1 (Guideline I - Psychological Conditions).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because her emotional, mental\nand personality conditions can impair her judgment, reliability or trustworthiness and her\nability to properly protect classified information.  \nThe Applicant admits allegations 1(a) and 1(c) and denies allegations 1(b) and 1\n(d) set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  With respect to the allegations she denied,\nshe provided no explanation.  Applicant began working for a major defense contractor in\nSeptember 2006.  She has been on medical disability for her mental condition since\nAugust 2008.  \nMedical records of the Applicant from 2005 to 2006, indicate that she received a\nmental health evaluation by a family practice physician in the Behavior Health/Addictive\nBehavior Department of a hospital.  At that time, the Applicant was diagnosed with\nDepression.  The physician noted that the condition could be a possible Bipolar\nDisorder.  (Government Exhibit 4).\nApplicant received a second mental health evaluation during the period from\nJune 2006 to February 2008, by a psychiatrist at the same hospital in the Behavior\nHealth Department.  Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.  The psychiatrist\nnoted that the Applicant\u2019s psychological problems could cause significant defect in\nfunctioning, which includes a defect in judgment, reliability and stability.  (Government\nExhibit 4).\nA third mental health evaluation was conducted during the period from January\n2007 to November 2007, by a third physician in the Behavioral Health/Addiction\nMedicine department of the hospital.  At that time, the Applicant was diagnosed with\nBipolar Disorder in partial remission.  (Government Exhibit 5).   \nOn March 24, 2009, the Applicant underwent a mental health evaluation by a\npsychologist hired by the Government.  The evaluation disclosed that the Applicant was\nsuffering from a Bipolar I Disorder, Severe, Most Recent Episode Depressed, with\nRapid Cycling; Panic Disorder without Agoraphobia; and Obsessive-Compulsive\n\n3\nDisorder.  The psychologist also noted that the Applicant\u2019s psychological problems\ncould cause a significant defect in functioning, which indicates a defect in judgment,\nreliability, and stability.  He performed a clinical analysis of the Applicant and prepared a\nreport of the evaluation.  (Government Exhibit 6 and Tr. p. 43).   \nThe clinical psychologist also testified at the hearing concerning his findings.  (Tr.\np. 42).  He stated that he based his diagnosis on his interview of the Applicant as well\nas a corroborated assessment of her earlier medical records.  He determined that the\nApplicant\u2019s level of functioning was very low at that time, even though she was taking\nmedication for her condition.  Reading from his report, referring to the Applicant he\nstated, \u201cUnable to get out of the house most days.  Needing extra care from a live-in\nrelative to do basic household functions and child care taking functions.  She lacked the\nconfidence to drive, and it was a struggle for her to get out of the bedroom most days.\nSome days, she did not\u2013was not able to do that\u2013was not able to get out of the\nbedroom.\u201d  (Tr. pp. 30-31).  He explained that Bipolar Disorder cannot be cured by\nmedication, but can be stabilized.  (Tr. p. 34).  The Applicant\u2019s disorder was not\nstabilized.         \nDuring his testimony, the clinical psychologist explained each of the Applicant\u2019s\ndiagnoses and its related symptoms.  The risks associated with being a person\ndiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder include the manic risk that would involve reckless\nspending, reckless behavior, impulsive thoughtless. It could be life endangering acts,\nselling things, buying thinks, without thought.  That\u2019s at the extreme end of the mania.\nSometimes there is psychotic behavior in a manic episode.  At the other end, a very low\nmood.  He stated that the hyper stage of Bipolar Disorder would show a person\u2019s\nimpaired judgment and reliability.  It is less likely to occur during the depressive stage.\n(Tr. pp. 34-35).\nThe psychologist also stated that the Applicant had also been experiencing Rapid\nCycling of Bipolar Disorder, which presents a rapid swing from hypomanic or manic to\ndepressive over a short period of time.  (Tr. p. 33).  Applicant was under medication for\nher condition which included Seraquel, an anti-psychotic drug, used as a substitute for a\nmood stabilizer or anti-convulsant.  In his opinion, the medication did not have her\nmental condition under control.  (Tr. p. 34 and Government Exhibit 3).   \nThe Applicant\u2019s Panic Disorder exhibits sharp bursts of anxiety that typically have\nrapid heart beat.  He explained a variety of physical symptoms that are possible, and\njust an overall intense feeling of dread and overwhelmed and incapacity.  (Tr. 36).\nAlthough he did not observe this behavior during his interview, the medical\nrecords revealed that the Applicant has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  The\npsychologist explained that this is an uncontrollable rumination about anything and\neverything or about some focused insight, worry, and the compulsive part is an\nuncontrollable urge to perform a behavior in a repetitive way that is not normal function.\nFor example, at times, the Applicant reported that she brushed her teeth 10 to12 times\nand day, and washed her hands eleven times a day.  (Tr. pp.  38-39)  \n\n4\nIn 2008, the Applicant underwent Electro-ConvulsiveTherapy, (Shock Therapy).\nShe was hospitalize for almost two months and received approximately 12 shock\ntreatment sessions.  She testified that as a result of the treatment, she has experienced\nboth short term memory loss and migraines.  (Tr. pp. 65-66).\nMedical records provided to the Government from the Applicant dated July 13,\n2009, reflect the report of another physician who indicates some additional disorders.\nHis diagnoses include Bipolar 1 Disorder, Depressed, Severe with Psychosis;\nDelusional Disorder, Percusectory; Insomnia due to Mental Disorder, Hyposomnia\nrelated to Axis 1 or 2 Disorder; Nightmare Disorder; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder;\nPanic Disorder with Agoraphobia; Organic Anxiety Syndrome; Organic Mood Disorder;\nInsomnia Related to Medical Condition; and Pain Disorder Associated with both General\nMedical Condition and Psychological Factors.  (Government Exhibit 7). \nThe Applicant testified that she has been suffering from her mental illnesses\nsince she was a teenager.  (Tr. p. 58).  She first received treatment for her condition at\nthe age of 22.  She states that her condition worsened after having her child in 2004.\nPresently, the Applicant sees her psychiatrist every six to eight weeks and he is\nstill in the process of adjusting her medication to improve results.  (Tr. p. 67).  At this\npoint, the Applicant is afraid to drive.  She has her mother help her with her child and\ndaily household chores.  Her daily regime also includes taking five different medications.\nShe believes that most of her conditions are controlled by medication.   \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nGuideline I - (Psychological Conditions)\n27. The Concern.  Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not\nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline.  A duly qualified mental health\nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to\nand approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially\ndisqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline.  No negative inference\n\n5\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raise solely on the basis of seeking\nmental health counseling.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n28(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to\nemotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior.\n28(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual\nhas a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne. The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng. The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan unacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline I (Psychological\nConditions) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between\nApplicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's questionable psychological conditions has a\ndirect and negative impact on her suitability for access to classified information.  \nOver the past twelve years, competent mental health professionals have\nevaluated and treated the Applicant\u2019s mental condition, and have diagnosed several\nmental disorders.  The question to be addressed now is whether the Applicant has\nemotional, mental or personality disorders, which can cause a significant defect in the\nindividual\u2019s psychological, social, and occupational functioning that may adversely affect\nthe individual\u2019s ability to properly safeguard classified information. Clearly the\nApplicant\u2019s mental condition poses a security risk.  The medical professionals that have\nevaluated the Applicant including psychiatrists and psychologists indicate that the\nApplicant\u2019s psychological problems could cause a significant defect in functioning, which\nindicates a defect in judgment, reliability, and stability.  \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s mental illnesses are not controlled or in remission, but are full blown.\nThe nature of the illnesses are continuing.  Applicant is continuing to take her\nmedication and is currently adjusting the medication to find its best results.  However,\nher condition is not yet under control.  Considering this evidence in totality, the\nApplicant\u2019s mental condition demonstrates an emotional, mental, and personality\ncondition that can impair judgment, reliability and trustworthiness and can adversely\naffect her ability to protect classified information.  \nUnder Guideline I, Psychological Conditions, Disqualifying Conditions 28(a)\nbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness that\nis not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to emotionally\nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior, and 28(b)\nan opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a\ncondition not covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThere has been no evidence presented in mitigation significant to override the\nApplicant\u2019s heavy burden in this case.  Applicant has not met her burden of\ndemonstrating that her psychological condition does not raise a security concern, and\nGuideline I is found against the Applicant.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of her psychological condition and the impact that it can have on\nher ability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the\nApplicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.   \n \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his May 2007 e-QIP by failing to disclose his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing and by misrepresenting that his 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was closed (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant admitted the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and the revocation of the discharge, but denied the case was still open.

Crowley, Esquire, Chief Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 18, 2007. On July 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its decision to\ndeny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 5, 2008. He answered the\nSOR allegations in writing on September 12, 2008, and requested a hearing. The case\nwas assigned to me on November 12, 2008, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n2\nclearance for Applicant. On November 13, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for December 1,\n2008. \nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Ten government exhibits (Ex. 1-10) and one\nApplicant exhibit (Ex. A) were admitted. Applicant and the older of his two sons testified,\nas reflected in a transcript received on December 10, 2008. Based upon a review of the\nSOR, Answer, transcript, and documentary exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that following an\nOctober 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant\u2019s case was reopened in May\n2005 for failure to disclose an annuity and his discharge was revoked in July 2006 with\nthe case still open as of June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant filed a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy petition in November 2004, but his case was dismissed in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6\n1.b); and that Applicant owes several delinquent debts totaling $13,983 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-\n1.r). Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his May\n2007 e-QIP by failing to disclose his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing and by\nmisrepresenting that his 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was closed (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant admitted the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and the revocation of the discharge,\nbut denied the case was still open. He admitted the Chapter 13 filing and its dismissal,\nas well as the debts alleged with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.m. He explained that he was\nseeking to consolidate his debts. Applicant denied that he deliberately falsified his e-\nQIP. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 60-year-old electrical tester, who has worked for his current\nemployer, a defense contractor, since May 1972 (Ex. 1, Tr. 61). He seeks to retain the\nsecret-level security clearance that he has held for the past 33 years (Tr. 61, 159). It\nwas last renewed in May 1996 by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office\n(DISCO) (Exs. 1, 7).\nApplicant was married to his first wife from September 1972 to about October\n1981 (Ex. 1, Tr. 71-72). In August 1988, he married his second wife, from whom he is\nnow divorced (Tr. 79). They had three children together, a son before their marriage in\nFebruary 1988, a daughter in July 1989, and another son in January 1993 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n73). She worked outside the home, initially for a local law firm and then as a\nsecretary/medical records clerk at a medical center (Tr. 75-77). Applicant\u2019s spouse\nhandled the family\u2019s finances. He turned over all but $50 of his pay to her each week\n(Tr. 90). They financed their home a couple of times for the funds to cover their financial\nobligations (Tr. 91).\nIn late January 1999, Applicant\u2019s spouse suffered a traumatic brain injury from a\nfall down their basement stairs (Tr. 77). Following brain surgery and a lengthy\nhospitalization of three or four months and then rehabilitation (Tr. 80-81), she was\nunable to work and the responsibility of providing for her and the children fell on him. In\nApril 1999, Applicant was legally appointed to act on behalf of his spouse and her estate\n\nThere is conflicting evidence as to when Applicant\u2019s spouse went to live with her mother. Applicant\n1\ngave a separation date of June 2001 on his e-QIP (Ex. 1), and his son testified that she left them about seven\nyears ago (Tr. 153). However, Applicant testified that his spouse resided with them for about a year in a home\nthat he purchased in 2002 (Tr. 85, see also Ex. 8). He told a government investigator in August 2007 that his\nspouse left in 2002 (Ex. 2).\nIn October 2004, on Applicant\u2019s motion, the bankruptcy court ordered that the judgment liens that\n2\ncould impair his exemption were avoided, but that should his bankruptcy case be dismissed, they would be\nreinstated (Ex. 8).\nThe annuity was from an insurance settlement with the payout at $1,000 per month for 20 years (Tr.\n3\n71).\n3\n(Ex. 2, Tr. 61-62). He had medical insurance that covered most of her care, although he\nincurred a debt obligation of about $1,790 with one health care provider for her care\n(Ex. 8, Tr. 80). She received social security disability payments of $1,000 per month that\nApplicant put toward their bills (Tr. 80, 83). He began receiving notices from creditors\nconcerning debts that he could not pay, including some debts that his spouse had\nincurred before her injury without his knowledge (Tr. 61-62). He earned gross income of\n$34,331 for 2002 and $33,257 for 2003 (Ex. 8). Applicant\u2019s spouse eventually went to\nlive with her mother (\u201cHer mother basically took her away.\u201d) (Tr. 83-86),  and the\n1\nprobate court removed Applicant as conservator (Tr. 89). Their children remained with\nhim (Tr. 67). He had to do without her disability pay (Tr. 80), but continued to receive\n$1,000 a month in annuity payments from an insurance settlement from a motorcycle\naccident in 1985 (Ex. 10).\nFacing foreclosure of his $91,200 mortgage on the home he bought for $147,000\nin June 2002 (Exs. 4, 8), and with his wages subject to two garnishment orders issued\nin January 2004 to collect debts of $10,352.57 and $1,129.35 (Ex. 7), Applicant filed an\nindividual petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 26, 2004, listing $203,138.17 in\nliabilities ($120,501.80 in secured claims and $82,636.37 in unsecured debt). Applicant\nlisted as assets his residence and $18,025 in personal property ($1,000 in\nmiscellaneous household goods, $5,000 retirement pension, and two 1996 model-year\nvehicles with market value totaling $12,025). He indicated his intent to retain his home\nand one of the vehicles, on which he would continue to make regular payments. The\nproperty was encumbered by liens filed against him for unpaid property taxes of $4,194,\nand unpaid judgments of $8,485.46 and $920 from December 2003 (Ex. 8).  He did not\n2\nlist his $1,000 monthly annuity payments on his bankruptcy petition (Tr. 97).  On\n3\nSeptember 15, 2004, the trustee filed a no distribution report, and on October 25, 2004,\nApplicant was granted a Chapter 7 discharge (Ex. 8).\nOn December 10, 2004, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy listing\n$155,625 in assets (his home, $1,000 in miscellaneous household goods, and the value\nof the vehicle he retained in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy), and $111,702.79 in liabilities\n(secured claims that did not include the judgment liens avoided in the Chapter 7\nbankruptcy). He listed no unsecured debt, but included the $1,000 monthly annuity\nincome on the advice of his attorney to show that he had the income to make payments\nunder a plan (Ex. 10, Tr. 64, 99). Current income and expense figures showed\ndiscretionary funds of $1,468.15 per month with $0.00 to be paid into the plan each\n\nApplicant maintains that he did not realize that the bankruptcy attorney expected him to hand over\n4\nhis monthly annuity on its receipt. He used the annuity funds to pay his monthly expenses (Tr. 155).\n4\nweek. On January 22, 2005, Applicant filed an amendment to the plan, indicating that\nhe would pay $530.86 monthly to the trustee for 60 months to repay a mortgage\narrearage of $21,866.83, $3,268.53 in local real estate taxes, $1,130 on his auto loan,\nand $411.82 in delinquent water/sewer charges. (Ex. 10). After living through the winter\nwith a broken furnace in his residence (Tr. 94), and with the lender threatening\nforeclosure, Applicant sold his house in about June 2005, and the mortgage was paid\noff (Ex. 2, Ex. 5). He and his children moved into a small apartment (Tr. 94).\nOn April 5, 2005, the trustee for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy moved to reopen the\nChapter 7 case on being informed by the Chapter 13 trustee of the $1,000 monthly\nannuity payments that Applicant had not disclosed (Ex. 8). On April 29, 2005, the\nChapter 13 case was dismissed (Ex. 10), and on May 4, 2005, the Chapter 7 case was\nreopened. On May 17, 2005, Applicant filed an amended Schedule B including the\nannuity worth $26,285, and seeking to exempt that annuity. On May 26, 2005, the\ntrustee moved to revoke Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 discharge for fraudulent concealment of\nthe annuity on his initial filing and for failure to report it during a meeting of the creditors.\nOn July 14, 2005, $1,782.26 in pre-confirmation payments from the Chapter 13 filing\nwere transferred to the Chapter 7 trustee, and Applicant\u2019s monthly annuity began to be\npaid directly to the trustee as well. On July 26, 2005, Applicant was ordered to turn over\n$10,217.74 to the trustee (the amount of his annuity payments received after the filing of\nthe bankruptcy) for asset distribution as well as any future annuity payments. Applicant\ndid not comply and he was ordered to appear to show cause why he should not be held\nin contempt (Ex. 8).4\nOn April 25, 2006, Applicant notified the government of the revocation of his\nChapter 7 discharge:\nI did not disclose an annuity I had at this period in time and the bankruptcy\nfor Chapter seven was denied! The trustee in charge, [name omitted] in\nresponse to this took claim of my annuity. At a specified time he wanted\nmy annuity payments each month which I did not acknowledge he wanted\nimmediately the monthly payments I was receiving. This amount totaled to\n$10,000. He is now looking to some way of getting this money through the\ncourt system. . . . (Ex. 7).\nOn May 28, 2006, Applicant offered to settle claims against him by waiving his\nChapter 7 discharge and assigning his federal income tax refund to the trustee. On\nJune 26, 2006, the court approved the settlement, and on July 5, 2006, his Chapter 7\ndischarge was revoked. On March 16, 2007, Applicant turned over his $4,708.05 tax\nrefund to the trustee. After a final receipt of $15,000 in annuity proceeds from the\ninsurer, the trustee submitted a report in December 2007 showing disbursement of\n$60.10 and a balance of $49,713.48 ($49,490.31 in annuity proceeds) for distribution to\n\nThe five debts are the  $919 judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, $2,497.14 to the same creditor owed the\n5\ndebt in \u00b6 1.j, credit card debts of $7,491.68 and $2,626.93 (not alleged), and $30,499.83 ($30,126.37\nproposed payment) to a creditor not identified in the SOR or in the available credit reports. The creditor  in\nSOR \u00b6 1.g filed a personal property claim for $988.59 that was disallowed by the trustee. It appears to have\nbeen a charged off balance on the automobile loan for the vehicle  Applicant reaffirmed in the bankruptcy.\nThe collection agency  named in SOR \u00b6 1.c filed a claim for $7,491.68 that it later withdrew because the\noriginal creditor filed a claim for the same amount that was allowed. This debt was not shown to be a duplicate\ndebt of SOR \u00b6 1.c (Ex. 8).\nOnly the court docket entry indicating the date of the final distribution report was available for review.\n6\nThe distribution report itself was not included in Exhibit 8.\n5\nfive of the seven of Applicant\u2019s creditors that had filed claims under the plan.  One claim\n5\nhad been disallowed and the other had been withdrawn by the collection agency as a\nduplicate of an allowed claim. On February 12, 2008, the trustee filed a final distribution\nreport.6\nFor a periodic reinvestigation into his security clearance, Applicant executed an\ne-QIP on May 18, 2007. In response to question 27.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you\nfiled a petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?,\u201d\nApplicant disclosed that he had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in about October 2004,\nbut it was denied and his case was now closed. He did not list his Chapter 13\nbankruptcy filing. He answered \u201cYes\u201d to questions 27.b concerning any garnishment of\nhis wages in the last 7 years and 27.d concerning any unpaid judgments against him in\nthe last 7 years, and listed a $100 garnishment of his wages by a furniture company.\nApplicant also responded \u201cYes\u201d to the financial delinquency inquiries, 28.a. \u201cIn the last 7\nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28.b. \u201cAre you\ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d. He listed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l\n(but claimed his son was responsible), 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q. \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 22, 2007, revealed two unpaid medical\njudgments of $919 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $1,825 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) from 2003, and outstanding\ndelinquent balances on six accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.k). Additional\ndebt had either been transferred or was listed as included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy,\nwhich was reported as discharged in October 2004 (Ex. 3). A check of the three credit\nbureaus on June 15, 2007, revealed additional past due balances (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.p, and\n1.q) placed for collection since November 2006 (Ex. 4).\nOn July 5, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nthe garnishments of his wages and his bankruptcy filings. Applicant indicated the\ngarnishments were lifted when he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant related a\ndischarge was granted in October or November 2004, but when questioned further he\nadmitted that the Chapter 13 filing had been dismissed and his Chapter 7 case\nreopened for failure to include his annuity payment in his income. Applicant indicated he\nwas unaware of what he owed or to whom he owed it. He was requested to return with\nfinancial information. Ten days later, Applicant presented income information only and\nwas unable or unwilling to provide any detail as to his indebtedness (Ex. 2).\n\nSeveral of the debts were included on his bankruptcy petition (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i).\n7\nOnly one of the debts in the SOR (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was to be paid by the trustee. \n6\nApplicant was reinterviewed on August 28, 2007. Concerning the $1,825 medical\njudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f) for which he was reported to be solely liable, Applicant explained\nthat his spouse was responsible for her own medical bills since he no longer had power\nof attorney. He did not intend to satisfy the debt. He claimed no knowledge of the other\nmedical judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He admitted he owed a dental debt of about $90 (SOR \u00b6\n1.k), an unknown collection balance on the furniture debt listed on his e-QIP (not\nalleged), about $1,100 on an automobile loan delinquent since 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and\nabout $500 in delinquent debt for residential telephone services (SOR \u00b6 1.h). He\nthought an outstanding gas debt for his home (SOR \u00b6 1.j) had been paid by the state\u2019s\ndepartment of children and family services. He expressed a willingness but present\ninability to repay his debts, as he was still struggling to regain his financial footing (Ex.\n2).\nA $100 medical debt from July 2007 was placed for collection the following\nmonth (SOR \u00b6 1.r). In October 2007, Applicant financed the purchase of a vehicle\nthrough a loan of $9,898 to be repaid at $236 per month (Ex. 6). Applicant took out a\nloan against his 401(k) of $2,000 for the down payment. He is repaying the loan at  $50\nper week (Tr. 124, 131). In response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant obtained\nhis credit report on February 24, 2008, which listed the unpaid judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e\nand 1.f, and the unpaid balances in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.q (Ex. 2). Applicant\nreceived an income tax refund of between $5,000 and $6,000 for 2007 that he used to\ncatch up on his bills and for household expenses (Tr. 139-40).\nIn early fall 2008, the engine burned up in the vehicle Applicant had purchased in\nOctober 2007. He owes about $6,800 on the vehicle loan (Tr. 124-25). Although he still\nhad the 1996 model-year vehicle that he had reaffirmed in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, it\nneeded tires (Tr. 124), so he took some proceeds from the sale of his mother\u2019s home on\nher death and bought a 1997-model year vehicle for $4,000 to $4,200 cash (Tr. 131-34).\nAs of early December 2008, Applicant had not shown any progress toward\nresolving the debts in the SOR or other accounts that could potentially be pursued due\nto the discharge being revoked (Ex. 5, 6), with the exception of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e.7\nApplicant is still not sure about what he owes (Tr. 102), although he recognized as likely\ndebts those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, and 1.r (Tr. 101-15).\nHe expressed his belief that the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.j, 1.m, and 1.p had been paid (Tr.\n109-10, 113), although he submitted no proof of the debts\u2019 satisfaction. He indicated he\nwould \u201cbe more than happy to try to get a hold of a debt solutions facility or something, if\nneed be, and to satisfy the government and what not, and try to start making payments\non whatever is owed.\u201d (Tr. 103). He had not pursued debt consolidation because he\n\u201cwas hoping to find out exactly where [he] stood with the investigation here, as far as\nwhat was owed. . . .\u201d (Tr. 137).\nApplicant\u2019s monthly income is $2,580 ($2,000 wages and $580 in social security\nbenefits for his younger son) (Tr. 116-18). He had received social security benefits for\n\n7\nhis two older children as well when they were younger, although the aggregate is about\nwhat he now receives for his youngest child. His expenses are estimated at between\n$2,600 and $2,700 per month, and include $100 in monthly cellular phone charges for\nhis sons who live with him (Tr. 119-26, 150). The younger son is a high school\nsophomore (Tr. 73, 118). His older son is unemployed (Tr. 73-75), and is home most of\nthe day (Tr. 150). Applicant is hoping that his older son will find a job soon so that he\ncan contribute financially to the household (Tr. 139). This son\u2019s last job was \u201ca few\nyears back\u201d at a gas station where he was paid \u201cunder the table.\u201d He worked there\nabout one year. He had previously worked for six or seven months at a cemetery. When\nhe was employed, he gave his father $20 to $25 each week (Tr. 146-47). Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter is a college student who moved into her own apartment in late November\n2008 (Tr. 74-75). Applicant\u2019s supervisor is of the opinion that Applicant can be trusted to\ncontinue to handle classified material based on Applicant\u2019s long record of appropriately\nsafeguarding classified material (Ex. A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\n8\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs reflected in his bankruptcy petition filed in July 2004, in his credit reports, and\nin his admissions to most of the debts in the SOR, Applicant has a long record of\nfinancial delinquency that has yet to be resolved. Accounting for duplicate listing of\nsome claims, Applicant owed unsecured debt of about $70,500 as of July 2004, only\nabout $8,154 of which was listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i). He also\nowed secured debt: property taxes of $4,194, $1,550 on his vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and\ntwo judgment liens (including SOR \u00b6 1.e) totaling $9,369. This delinquent debt accrued\ndespite his receipt of a $1,000 monthly annuity payment. Significant security concerns\nare raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history\nof not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nMoreover, AG \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account\nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other financial breaches of trust,\u201d also\napplies because of his failure to disclose the annuity income on his Chapter 7\nbankruptcy petition. Applicant maintains he acted in good-faith and on the advice of\ncounsel:\nAnd, for some reason, I had it in my thoughts and, because I received that\nand had, every year, every month I was paid a sum of money and I never\nhad to pay any kind of taxes to the IRS for it, so I figured being a\nsupplement of income where it pertained to my financial, not financial, my\nphysical problems that occurred through this accident, that I didn\u2019t have to\ndisclose it.  In the course of the Chapter 7, I had mentioned that to this first\nattorney [name omitted]. He said, well, he says I don\u2019t feel you have to\n\n9\ndisclose it, and I went on to the investigation with [name of bankruptcy\ntrustee omitted] (Tr. 63).\nThe bankruptcy court reopened Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy and dismissed the\nChapter 13 on concerns of the trustee that Applicant had fraudulently concealed the\nannuity payments. Had Applicant acted in good faith, it stands to reason that he would\nhave disclosed the annuity during the meeting of creditors or at some other time to the\ntrustee before the discharge and he did not. Instead, during the meeting of creditors on\nAugust 18, 2004, he apparently asserted as to his assets and income that his schedules\nwere true and accurate in all respects. The Chapter 7 trustee came to learn of the asset\nonly from the Chapter 13 trustee. Applicant could have filed an amendment to his\nChapter 7 petition but instead waited until his unsecured creditors were legally barred\nfrom pursuing collection and then filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Applicant presented\nno corroboration for his claim that he had been advised by legal counsel to not list the\nannuity on his Chapter 7 petition. Applicant\u2019s need for the annuity to cover part of his\nhousehold expenses does not extenuate or justify his failure to timely disclose this\nknown asset to the bankruptcy court.\n \nConcerning potential mitigation, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d does not apply. A review of Applicant\u2019s Schedule F of his Chapter 7 petition\nshows that he owed more than $50,000 in credit card debt. Even though several of the\naccounts were opened before his spouse\u2019s injury, they were in his name and it is\ndifficult to believe that Applicant would have been unaware of at least some of the debt,\nor of the purchases made on credit. Such over-reliance on credit shows an inability to\nlive within one\u2019s means (see AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means,\nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d). Moreover, he has continued to incur new\ndebt. In addition to the $4,171 in recent delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.r, he owes\n$6,800 on a car note that he took out in 2007, and is repaying a $2,000 loan from his\n401(k) that he took out for the down payment. While there is no indication that he is\ndelinquent in repaying either the car note or the 401(k) loan, the $400 in additional\nmonthly obligations further stresses an already tenuous financial situation.\nIn fairness to Applicant, his spouse suffered a serious head injury in a 1999 fall\nthat left her unable to work. With no information available about her previous earnings, it\nis unclear to what extent his spouse\u2019s monthly disability benefit compensated for the\nloss of employment income. Her accident and their subsequent marital separation are\nunforeseen circumstances that implicate AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Some early neglect of\nhis financial obligations is understandable given the demands of caring for his spouse,\nbut I am unable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b) in this case because of his serious financial\nirresponsibility reflected in his abuse of the bankruptcy process, his inattention to his\npast due obligations over the years, and his incurring of recent financial delinquency.\n\n10\nApplicant expresses an intent to resolve his indebtedness if given a chance to\nmake payments through debt consolidation, but he has not been proactive in\naddressing his debts. Applicant was placed on notice as of his initial interview with a\ngovernment investigator in early July 2005 that his finances were of concern to the\nDepartment of Defense. Despite having filed Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy\npetitions, he claimed to not know what he owed or to whom. Asked to provide debt\ninformation, Applicant returned 10 days later again claiming not to know what he owed.\nOrdered by the bankruptcy court in July 2005 to turn over annuity payments he had\nreceived since filing for liquidation of his debt, Applicant had used the funds for\nhousehold expenses, and he eventually agreed to waive his Chapter 7 discharge and\nturn over his income tax refund. Apparently, he made little effort at that point to educate\nhimself about the debts he would be legally obligated to repay. From net receipts\ntotaling $49,773.58 (the annuity and income tax refund), the Chapter 7 trustee proposed\nto make payments to five creditors, including the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant could\nreasonably expect the trustee to make the promised disbursements. However, several\nother creditors have legal claims against him that remain unpaid, including a cable\ntelevision company debt for $455 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) and an insurance company debt for $710\n(SOR \u00b6 1.q).\nApplicant obtained a credit report in response to DOHA interrogatories in\nFebruary 2008. Confronted with adverse credit information that  several accounts in\naddition to SOR \u00b6 1.e were being reported as past due (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.i,\n1.n, and 1.q), he made no effort to contact those creditors. On receipt of the SOR, he\nindicated he was looking at debt consolidation to catch up on his expenses. As of the\ndate of his hearing, he had not pursued any debt consolidation or made any repayment\narrangements to resolve even those debts of $100 or less, including a medical debt that\nwas placed for collection as recently as August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.r). While he had\nunexpected vehicle expenses of late, he also testified that he received an income tax\nrefund of between $5,000 and $6,000 for 2007 that he used to catch up on his bills.\nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($1,400 utility services debt listed on his\ne-QIP) on the basis that it had been paid with the assistance of the department of\nchildren and family services (Tr. 111). He also expressed his belief that the debts in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.p had been paid (Tr. 109-110), but did not document the claimed\nsatisfaction. When he was interviewed in August 2007, he expressed his belief that the\ngas services debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j had been paid with public assistance (Ex. 2). The debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.j was still listed as past due on his January 2008 (Ex. 5) and June 2008 (Ex.  6\ncredit reports. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p appeared on his January 2008 credit report as an\nactive collection debt but not on his later credit report. Assuming Applicant had satisfied\nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.p, these efforts to repay his debts would more\nappropriately fall within AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d rather than AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Notwithstanding the revocation of\nhis Chapter 7 discharge, about $43,661.12 in general unsecured claims were going to\nbe paid by the trustee. Yet, given his abuse of the bankruptcy process and his ongoing\n\n11\nfinancial problems (his monthly expenses exceed his income), neither  \u00b6 20 (c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d or AG \u00b6 20(d) fully\nmitigate the financial concerns in this case.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, \u00b6 15 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nIn response to question 27.a on his e-QIP, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you filed a\npetition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?,\u201d Applicant\nindicated he had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in about October 2004 but it was\nnot granted. He added that there was nothing pending and the case was now closed.\nThe government contends that Applicant deliberately did not disclose his Chapter 13\nfiling, or that his Chapter 7 case had been reopened and was still pending as of his May\n18, 2007, e-QIP. Applicant explained he did not report the Chapter 13 filing because \u201cit\nnever got off first base. It never went into effect.\u201d As for his assertion that his Chapter 7\nbankruptcy was closed, Applicant testified that once he had turned over his annuity and\nincome tax refund to the trustee, he \u201cfigured everything was over and done with\u201d (Tr.\n101).\nEven if mistaken, a belief or assumption held in good faith could negate the willful\nintent required for a finding of deliberate concealment, omission, or falsification.\nAvailable bankruptcy records (Ex. 10) show Applicant filed a voluntary petition under\nChapter 13 on December 10, 2004. After a meeting of the creditors, Applicant filed an\namended plan on January 24, 2005. By order of the court, the case was dismissed prior\nto confirmation. Although Applicant made $1,857.26 in pre-confirmation payments to the\nChapter 13 trustee, I am not convinced that he understood he had to report the Chapter\n13 as a separate filing on his e-QIP. As for allegedly misrepresenting that the Chapter 7\ncase was closed, the bankruptcy court did not close the Chapter 7 case until July 17,\n2008, more than a year after Applicant completed his e-QIP. The trustee filed his final\ndistribution report on February 12, 2008. However, the trustee began receiving\nApplicant\u2019s monthly annuity payment in July 2005, and Applicant had turned over his\nincome tax refund to the trustee on or about March 16, 2007. His explanation for\nconsidering the case as closed is accepted under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 17 (f), \u201cthe\ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d applies to\nmitigate any potential security concerns raised by his failure to report his Chapter 13\nfiling (see AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\n\n12\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d).\nApplicant\u2019s omission of his annuity from his bankruptcy petition is conduct that\ncould have been alleged under personal conduct (see AG 16(a)). Similarly, his failure to\ndisclose his annuity when asked about his assets during the meeting of creditors could\nfall within the concerns underlying AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d Since\nhis failure to disclose the annuity to the bankruptcy court before his Chapter 13 filing in\nDecember 2004 was not alleged under personal conduct, it cannot provide an\nindependent basis for disqualification under Guideline E. However, it certainly is\nrelevant in assessing the risk presented by his financial situation (see Guideline F,\nsupra), and his overall judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness under the whole-person\nconcept. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s finances were negatively affected by the loss of his spouse\u2019s income\nand then her social security disability benefit. In July 2004, he sought relief from more\nthan $80,000 in unsecured debt through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Needing the\nproceeds of an annuity to cover living expenses and wanting to relieve himself of his\nlegal responsibility to pay debt more than double his annual wage income, he elected to\nnot disclose it on his petition. He paid a high price for his poor judgment in that he lost\nhis annuity and the benefit of a financial fresh start.\nApplicant deserves significant credit for raising three children on his own, with no\nfinancial help from his former spouse. After he was forced to sell his home in 2005, he\nand his children moved into a small apartment, thereby reducing his monthly housing\ncosts. At the same time, it is also evident that he continues to indulge his children (e.g.,\n\n13\n$100 in monthly cellular phone costs for his sons). He has repeatedly expressed\nignorance about what he owes and to whom.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nTo date, he has yet to establish a plan to resolve his financial problems. His tendency to\nignore debts, presumably hoping that they will just go away, is inconsistent with the\ngood judgment that is required of those with access to classified information.\nApplicant has stable employment, having worked for his employer since 1972\nand having held a security clearance for most of that time. Under the whole-person\nconcept, it must be acknowledged that Applicant has no record of violating his\nemployer\u2019s trust. Yet, this is not enough to mitigate the serious mismanagement of his\npersonal finances. In response to financial pressures, he has done what he felt he had\nto do to continue to provide for his family. By choosing to wait to disclose his annuity\nuntil it was most advantageous to him, Applicant raised considerable doubts about\nwhether he can be counted on to fulfill his fiduciary obligations irrespective of the\npersonal cost. Based on the facts before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant \n\n14\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The two oldest children are from his first marriage, which lasted from 2000 through 3 2006 (Tr. 29). He was not married to the mother of the youngest child (Tr. 30). The children\u2019s respective mothers have physical custody of them. Applicant attended college for approximately a year immediately after finishing high school in 1992, then left to pursue a job with a professional sports franchise. In 1995, he quit his job with the sports franchise, and joined the U.S. Air Force where he served until 2002. He was honorably discharged.

Also,\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debt which he failed to disclose in its entirety on\nhis 2005 security clearance application. These facts generate security concerns under\nGuidelines B, foreign influence, F, financial considerations, and E, personal conduct.\nAfter evaluating Applicant\u2019s background and family relationships, together with the\nnature of his ties to the country, and the country\u2019s relationship with the U.S., I conclude\nhe has mitigated the foreign influence security concern. As for the financial\nconsiderations security concern, Applicant satisfied all of the delinquencies, and\nprovided evidence demonstrating that his finances are currently organized and stable.\nHis explanation for failing to disclose all of his delinquencies on his security clearance\napplication was credible. He has mitigated the financial considerations and personal\nconduct security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nOn September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns, as\ndescribed above. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nJune 15, 2009\n\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on November 12, 2008, admitting Paragraph 1,\nsubparagraphs 2.a through 2.b, 2.d through 2.f, 2.j through 2.k, 2.o, 2.t, 2.v, 3.a through\n3.c, and 4.d and 4.f. He denied the others and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 10, 2009. On March 10, 2009 a Notice of Hearing was\nissued  scheduling the case for April 7, 2009. \nAt the hearing, I received six government exhibits, and 25 Applicant exhibits\nmarked A1 through A7, B1 through B10, C1 through C6, and D1 through D2. Also, I\nreceived Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the end of the hearing, I left the record open at\nApplicant\u2019s request to allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted,\nApplicant submitted 14 additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) E through R. The transcript was received on April 10, 2009.\nRulings of Procedure\nI granted department counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw SOR subparagraphs 2.c, 2.p\nthrough 2.r, 2.u, 2.v, Paragraph 3, and SOR subparagraphs 4.e and 4.f. Also, upon a\nmotion of department counsel, I amended SOR subparagraphs 2.s and 4.d,\nrespectively, to read as follows:\n2.s. As of May 27, 2008, you had approximately $3,835.00 per month in\ndiscretionary income, yet you have not paid the debts set forth in\nsubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d - 2.o.\n4.d. On or about May 2005, you were arrested in State X for writing,\nmaking and/or presenting a worthless check. You were subsequently\nfound guilty and were ordered to pay a fine of $208.00.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment counsel, in a motion filed January 7, 2009, requested that I take\nadministrative notice of facts about South Korea set forth in 15 documents that I marked\nas Government Exhibits (GE) I through XV. At the close of the hearing, I took\nadministrative notice of the facts set forth in all of the exhibits except GE XII through XV.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36-year-old married man with three children, ages eight, six, and\ntwo. The two oldest children are from his first marriage, which lasted from 2000 through\n\n3\n2006 (Tr. 29). He was not married to the mother of the youngest child (Tr. 30). The\nchildren\u2019s respective mothers have physical custody of them. \nApplicant attended college for approximately a year immediately after finishing\nhigh school in 1992, then left to pursue a job with a professional sports franchise. In\n1995, he quit his job with the sports franchise, and joined the U.S. Air Force where he\nserved until 2002. He was honorably discharged. During his Air Force stint, he earned\nthe Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed\nForces Expeditionary Medal, the Air Force Overseas Service Ribbon, the Air Force\nLongetivity Ribbon, and the Air Force Training Ribbon (AE D1). \nWhile in the Air Force, Applicant worked as an avionics technician (Tr. 15). He\nheld a security clearance throughout his time in the Air Force (Tr. 33). For the past three\nyears, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor that manufactures fighter jets. For\nthe first year on the job, he worked as an aircraft weapons manager (Tr. 34). Since\nthen, he has worked as an aircraft logistics support manager.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to his supervisor, his integrity\nand dedication are unwavering (AE C3). A senior manager, who has been with the\ncompany for 25 years, characterizes Applicant as \u201cthe eyes and ears\u201d of the program\nwhere he works (AE C5). Another senior manager says that he works at a level far\nabove his peers (AE C1).\nApplicant has spent the past two and a half years living in the Republic of Korea.\nThe aircraft parts that he services are used on jets in the South Korean air force (AE C\n6).\nWhile living in Korea, Applicant met and married his current wife, a Korean\ncitizen and resident. She manages a fast food restaurant (Tr. 36). Her father is an\napartment security guard (Tr. 57). He served two years in the Korean military in his\nyouth as part of their compulsory service requirement (Tr. 38). Her mother is a\nhomemaker. Neither parent receives a government pension.\nApplicant\u2019s wife has three sisters who are Korean citizens and residents. One is\na Buddhist monk, another is an x-ray technician, the third is a nurse (Tr. 69). None work\nfor the Korean government. Both the x-ray technician and the nurse are married (Tr.\n39). The brothers-in-law\u2019s occupations are unknown from the record.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is the only member of her family who speaks fluent English.\nApplicant has a minimal understanding of the Korean language. Applicant and his wife\nspeak with her parents about once per month, and her sisters about once every other\nmonth (Tr. 84). All of Applicant\u2019s in-laws live in the same city as he does.\nApplicant and his wife maintain separate bank accounts (Tr. 41). None of\nApplicant\u2019s accounts are in Korea, nor does he have any other Korean property\ninterests.\n\n4\nThe Republic of Korea is a stable democratic republic with powers shared among\nthe president, the legislature, and the judiciary (AE I at 3; AE III at 3). It has an\nindependent press, and generally respects civil liberties (Id.). \nKorea\u2019s economic growth has been spectacular over the past 20 years (Id. at 4).\nIt is the United States\u2019 (U.S.) seventh largest trading partner (Id. at 6). In 2007, Korean\nand U.S. trade ministers negotiated the U.S. - Korea Free Trade Agreement (Id. at 6). It\nis awaiting ratification by both countries\u2019 legislatures. \nThe U.S. and Korea have been close allies since 1950, and have fought\ncommunism on the Korean peninsula and in Vietnam (Id. at 8; AE IV at 3; AE V at 1).\nThe U.S. and Korea signed a mutual defense treaty in 1953 (AE I at 6). Since then, the\nU.S. has maintained a military presence in Korea including the Army\u2019s Second Infantry\nDivision and several Air Force tactical squadrons (Id.). A Combined Forces Command\nwas established in 1978 to coordinate operations between U.S. and Korean forces (Id.).\nIn recent years, the U.S. and Korea have differed in their diplomatic approaches\ntoward North Korea. The U.S. position is more assertive in its attempts to curtail North\nKorea\u2019s development of advanced military technology such as ballistic missiles and\nnuclear weapons. South Korea has emphasized steps toward unification with North\nKorea (AE IV at 2).\nSouth Korea has a history of collecting protected U.S. information. It has targeted\nthe U.S. with intelligence gathering programs, and has focused its collection efforts on\ncomputer systems, aerospace and nuclear technologies (Exhibit VIII at 7). In May 1997,\na civilian employee of the U.S. Department of Navy, Office of Naval Intelligence,\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to obtain national defense information (see generally, AE\nIX). Among other things, between 1994 and 1996, he mailed several classified\ndocuments containing information about the national defense of the U.S. to an officer in\nthe South Korean navy (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports list approximately $32,000 of delinquent debt (GE 2\nthrough 4). SOR subparagraph 2.a is the deficiency remaining from a repossessed\nautomobile. When Applicant and his first wife separated, she kept their automobiles (Tr.\n45). Shortly before Applicant moved to South Korea, he instructed his estranged wife to\nsell them. She told him that she had sold them. Applicant did not know this was not true\nuntil meeting with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigative agent nearly\ntwo years later (Tr. 46). With the help of a credit counseling agency he retained in June\n2007, Applicant contacted the creditor, negotiated a settlement, and satisfied it by\nMarch 2009 (AE A2; AE E).\nSOR subparagraph 2.b is a credit card account that Applicant and his wife\nshared. He inadvertently did not cancel it when they separated, and she continued to\nuse it without his knowledge (Tr. 47). After his credit counselor informed him of this\ndebt, he contacted his ex-wife who wrote a check to satisfy it. The check bounced (Tr.\n47). Applicant then satisfied this debt on March 10, 2009 (AE F). \n\nSOR subparagraphs 2.d and 2.i are duplicates.\n1\nApplicant asserted that the late fees were excessive.\n2\n5\nSOR subparagraphs 2.d,  2.e, and 2.l, are phone accounts Applicant had opened\n1\nfor his ex-wife over the years (Tr. 49). Unbeknownst to him, she failed to pay them. He\nsatisfied them by June 2008 (AE H, J)\nSOR subparagraph 2.f is a medical bill incurred in 2004 to treat his son (Tr. 52).\nApplicant thought his then-wife had paid the deductible when she took their son to the\ndoctor. Shortly after discovering it was still outstanding, Applicant satisfied it (AE L).\nNeither Applicant nor his credit counseling agency could identify the creditor\nlisted in SOR subparagraph 2.g. Subsequently, the agency contacted the credit\nreporting agencies, and had it removed from his credit reports (Tr. 53).\nSOR subparagraph 2.h is a debt allegedly owed to a video store. Applicant\ncontacted the store, and it could not confirm it. He then contacted the credit counseling\nagency, who had it removed from his credit reports (Tr. 54).\nSOR subparagraph 2.j, a duplicate of SOR subparagraph 2.k, is another bill\nowed to the same bank that issued Applicant the credit card listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 2.b. The bank consolidated these debts, and Applicant\u2019s payment in\nMarch 2009 satisfied both.\nApplicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 2.m to confirm the\ndebt (Tr. 57). The creditor then referred him to a collection agent. The collection agency\nresearched the debt, and told him that it had no record of it, and that the only other\naccount in his name that a creditor had assigned to them had been satisfied (Tr. 58).\nSOR subparagraph 2.n is a credit card Applicant\u2019s ex-wife used when he was in\nthe military. He disputed the account with the creditor (Tr. 72).  His dispute was\n2\nrejected, and he subsequently satisfied the account (AE O).\nSOR subparagraph 2.o is the automobile loan that the divorce court transferred\nto Applicant\u2019s ex-wife through their divorce decree (Tr. 60). He was unaware either that\nshe was not making monthly payments timely after their divorce, or that it had been\nrepossessed (Id.). Applicant satisfied it entirely by March 16, 2009 (AE Q, AE R).\nIn May 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with writing, making and/or\npresenting a worthless check. He was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of $208.00.\nHe paid the fine, as ordered (AE 1 at 36). \nApplicant earns $80,000 per year (Tr. 83). His employer pays for his mortgage,\ncar, utilities, and all of his insurance (AE A1). He has $3,840 of monthly after-expense\nincome. He has $13,000 in his company\u2019s 401k, $1,700 in a personal savings account,\n\n6\n$600 in a personal savings account, and $500 in a joint account owned with his mother\n(AE A1). He satisfied the delinquencies through savings accrued while working in South\nKorea (Tr. 73, 81). He maintains a budget, has no debt, and does not have any credit\ncards. He earned approximately $52,000 on his previous job (Tr. 83).\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2005. He did\nnot disclose an automobile repossession, as required in response to Question 27b. He\nlisted the account as delinquent on Section 28 of the security clearance application (GE\n1 at 40). He was unaware of the repossession because his ex-wife kept the automobile\nafter their divorce, and told him that she had sold it.\nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to Questions 28a, (Your Financial Delinquencies In\nthe last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), and 28b,\n(Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?). He listed the account with\nthe car dealer, as mentioned above, and noted that earlier in 2005, he had \u201cfallen\nbehind on [his] responsibilities\u201d (Id.). He did not list any of the other SOR delinquencies.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6). The Republic of Korea is a staunch ally of the U.S. It has a stable, democratic\nsystem of governance, a highly developed economy, and an independent judiciary.\nConversely, Korea has a history of spying on the U.S., collecting classified\nmilitary information, and sensitive, economic and industrial information. Consequently,\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife and in-laws, all South Korean citizens and\nresidents, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness, or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d and AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons . . . if that relationship creates a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant lives in the same city as his sisters-in-law, he only sees them\napproximately once every two months. None of them work for the government or in\nprofessions where the targeting of U.S. technology would be reasonably conceivable.\nThe mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with\nforeign persons . . . or the position or activities of those persons in that country are such\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between\nthe interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government, and the\ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d and 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d apply to his sisters-in-law.\nApplicant\u2019s wife and parents-in-laws\u2019 positions and activities in South Korea are\nsimilarly innocuous. However, Applicant lives with his wife in South Korea, and there is\na presumption that relationships with parent-in-laws are not casual. AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the position or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government, and the interests of\nthe U.S.,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth. His parents are both U.S. citizens, and he was\nraised in the U.S. He served in the U.S. Air Force for seven years, earning several\nmedals and ribbons. He does not speak the Korean language, and has difficulty\ncommunicating with his parents-in-law. All of his children live in the U.S., and all of his\nproperty interests are located in the U.S. He did not begin developing these South\n\n8\nKorean contacts until after he relocated there to take a job with a U.S. defense\ncontractor that builds planes for the Korean air force. Given the extensive U.S. military\npresence in South Korea, and the volume of U.S./South Korea trade, it is axiomatic that\nsome U.S. citizens who are either stationed there, or employed there with defense\ncontractors will develop relationships with South Korean citizens that could trigger\nforeign influence security concerns. Upon evaluating Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties, the reason\nApplicant is living in South Korea, and his relationship with his South Korean family\nmembers, and their respective occupations, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies.\nApplicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concern.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s separation and subsequent divorce in 2005 significantly contributed to\nhis financial problems. His ex-wife accrued nearly all of the debts. She either lied to him\nabout their status, or continued using joint credit cards without his knowledge. Because\nApplicant was working abroad, he was unable to confirm what she was telling him.\nAfter meeting with an OPM agent in 2007, Applicant retained a credit counseling\nagency that helped him identify creditors, and negotiate settlement arrangements. By\nMarch 2009, he had satisfied them. The only delinquencies Applicant did not pay were\nthe ones whose creditors were unable to verify were his responsibility. In these cases,\nhe notified the credit counseling agency who then had the disputed debts removed from\nhis credit reports. In the one instance when Applicant\u2019s dispute of a debt was rejected\n(SOR subparagraph 2.n), he paid it, as required. \nApplicant maintains a budget. He has no debt, and does not use credit cards. He\nhas ample income to meet his current responsibilities. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d 20(d), \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts,\u201d and 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\n\n9\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem, and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute, or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s omission of pertinent financial information from his\nsecurity clearance application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant did not totally omit his financial delinquencies from the security\nclearance application. Instead, he disclosed that he had delinquent debts, listed one\nexample, and provided an explanation. He also listed the prosecution for writing a\nbounced check in response to another security clearance application question. Under\nthese circumstances, his explanation that he did not know his ex-wife was still accruing\ndebts on joint accounts after their divorce was credible. Applicant did not falsify his\nsecurity clearance application, and his answers do not trigger any personal conduct\nsecurity concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s 2005 prosecution for a bounced check is more indicative of the\nfinancial struggles he underwent during the marital breakdown rather than any\ndeficiency in judgment or propensity to disobey rules and regulations. As discussed\nabove, Applicant\u2019s finances are now stable, and his past problems are unlikely to recur.\nSOR subparagraph 4.d does not trigger a personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n10\nApplicant performed with distinction in the U.S. Air Force, and continues to\nperform his job exceptionally as a civilian employee of a major defense contractor. He\nexperienced a financial setback after his divorce, but responded in a disciplined\nmanner, methodically satisfying each delinquency as he discovered them. Upon\nconsidering Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance in light of the whole person\nconcept, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraphs 2.d - 2.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.p - 2.r:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 2.s - 2.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.u - 2.v:\nWITHDRAWN\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nWITHDRAWN\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 4.e - 4.f:\nWITHDRAWN\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, dated June 9, 2008, Applicant denies SOR allegation 1.a and admits to all remaining SOR allegations. Applicant is a 30-year-old senior mechanical engineer employed with a Department of Defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since December 2005. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, a Masters degree in optics, a PhD in Materials Science, and a PhD in Optics. She recently married in May 2008 and has no children.

When she lived in Cuba, she resided with her step-grandfather, her maternal grandmother, and her parents. Her parents 3 divorced when she was nine, and her father moved out of the house. Applicant has a half brother from her mother\u2019s subsequent relationship. (Tr at 54, 56; Gov 2; Answer to SOR.) Applicant\u2019s step-grandfather was a freedom fighter. He was sentenced to nine years in jail in 1961. He served seven and half years in prison. In the early 1990s, her step-grandfather sought political asylum from the U.S. In 1992, his application for political asylum was granted.

Evans, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on February 23, 2006. On May 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 9, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 3, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2008. On August 13, 2008, a Notice \nof Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for September 9, 2008. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 2, which \nwere admitted without objection. The Government requested that administrative notice \nbe taken of one document with 7 attachments. The document was marked as Hearing \nOctober 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibit 1 (Hearing Ex 1) without objection. Applicant testified and submitted eight \nexhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 H without objection. \nApplicant also called three witnesses on her behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nhearing on September 18, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nCuba is a totalitarian state led by acting president Raul Castor, Fidel Castro\u2019s \nbrother. Cuba\u2019s totalitarian regime controls all aspects of life through the communist \nparty and its affiliated mass organizations, the government bureaucracy, and the \nMinistry of the Interior. The government continues to commit serious human rights \nabuses and denies citizens the right to change their government.  \n \nThe U.S. and Cuba have a strained relationship and the U.S. does not have full \ndiplomatic relations with Cuba. The U.S. has a broad trade embargo against Cuba. \nAmericans traveling to Cuba must first obtain a license to engage in any travel-related \ntransactions related to travel to, from, and within Cuba. While the U.S. maintains \nsanctions against Cuba, it also supports the Cuban people through humanitarian efforts \nand continues to work for a \u201cFree Cuba.\u201d  \n \nCuba has been on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of State Sponsors of \nTerrorism since 1982. Cuba publically opposed the U.S.\u2019s global war on terrorism and \nhas not undertaken any counterterrorism efforts. Cuba maintains a close relationship \nwith Iran and Syria, and has offered safe havens for members of terrorist organizations.  \n \nThe Castro regime has long targeted the United States for intensive espionage \nactivities. Since the 1980\u2019s there have been numerous reported cases of Cuban \ngovernment sanctioned and supported espionage against the United States. \n \n(All sources for the above information are contained in Hearing Exhibit 1.)   \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 9, 2008, Applicant denies SOR allegation \n1.a and admits to all remaining SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old senior mechanical engineer employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since \nDecember 2005. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, a Masters degree in \noptics, a PhD in Materials Science, and a PhD in Optics. She recently married in May \n2008 and has no children. The SOR was amended to reflect her married name. This is \nher first time applying for a security clearance. (Tr at 54, 60-63; Gov 1; AE E.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Cuba. When she lived in Cuba, she resided \nwith her step-grandfather, her maternal grandmother, and her parents. Her parents \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndivorced when she was nine, and her father moved out of the house. Applicant has a \nhalf brother from her mother\u2019s subsequent relationship. (Tr at 54, 56; Gov 2; Answer to \nSOR.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s step-grandfather was a freedom fighter. He was sentenced to nine \nyears in jail in 1961. He served seven and half years in prison. In the early 1990s, her \nstep-grandfather sought political asylum from the U.S. In 1992, his application for \npolitical asylum was granted. Her step-grandfather and the family members living in his \nhousehold were allowed to immigrate to the U.S. In 1995, the family moved to the U.S. \nThe household included Applicant, her mother, her step-grandfather, her maternal \ngrandmother, her uncle, and her half brother. (Tr at 55-59; Answer to SOR; Gov 2.)  \n \nApplicant was 16 when she moved to the U.S. She attended high school and \ngraduated as the class valedictorian. She completed undergraduate and graduate \ndegrees at U.S. universities. One of her PhD\u2019s was awarded from a French university \nbut she studied for it in conjunction with her PhD that was awarded from a U.S. \nuniversity. (Tr at 54, 61-62; Gov 2; AE E.)  \n \nOn November 10, 2004, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. She applied for \ncitizenship as soon as she had the opportunity. She was very proud to be given the \nopportunity to be granted the rights and privileges of a U.S. citizen.  She does not \nconsider herself to be a dual citizen of the U.S. and Cuba.  She owns no property and \nhas no benefits from Cuba. Her mother, half brother, and uncle have become U.S. \ncitizens. (Tr at 64-66, 81; Gov 2.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, paternal grandmother, half-sister, and one-month old half \nbrother are citizens of and reside in Cuba. Her father is a sales representative for a \nGerman construction equipment company. Her grand-mother is retired. Her half-sister is \na high school student. She telephones her father and/or grandmother on a monthly \nbasis. She also has several extended family members (aunts, uncles, cousins) who \nreside in Cuba. None of her family members are associated with the Cuban \ngovernment. (Tr at 68-69; 82; Gov 2.)   \n \nApplicant visited family members in Cuba in 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2004. All of \nthe trips were authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of \nthe Treasury. She traveled with her maternal grandmother to visit family members. The \nduration of each visit was approximately two weeks. She was a Cuban citizen when she \ntraveled to Cuba and used her Cuban passport. (Tr at 66, 77-78; Gov 2; Answer to \nSOR.)   \n \nAfter she completed her PhD studies in 2005, her mother offered to pay for \nApplicant to visit family members in Cuba as a graduation present.  In August 2005, \nApplicant renewed her Cuban passport in anticipation of this trip. The Cuban \ngovernment requires Cuban citizens, including Cuban citizens who have immigrated to \nother countries, to use a Cuban passport when traveling to Cuba. She never pursued \nthe trip after she accepted the job with a defense contractor. She never used the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrenewed Cuban passport. She has not traveled to Cuba since becoming a U.S. citizen. \nShe does not intend to travel back to Cuba but will if relations between the U.S. and \nCuba become normalized and Cuba becomes a non-restricted country. (Answer to \nSOR.)   \n \nApplicant was not aware of the concerns raised by possessing a foreign passport \nwhile holding a security clearance. Once she discovered the concern, she invalidated \nthe passport in front of her Facility Security Officer. She presented the destroyed \npassport during the hearing.  She is aware that invalidating the Cuban passport might \nresult in her never seeing her family members residing in Cuba again. She has never \ntold her Cuban relatives about the nature of her work or her place of employment. (Tr at \n67-69, 76; Answer to SOR.)     \n \nApplicant\u2019s new husband is a citizen of France. They met while studying for their \ndoctorates at a U.S. university.  He has lived in the U.S. since 2001. He currently works \nas an optical engineer for a U.S. company. He currently has an H1B work visa and is in \nthe process of applying for permanent residence (i.e. green card.) (Tr at 82; Answer to \nSOR.)  \n \nSeveral superiors and co-workers from Applicant\u2019s company testified on her \nbehalf.  She has impressed her superiors with her knowledge and strong work ethic. \nThe Vice President of Science and Technology of the company has worked in the \ndefense and aerospace industry for 30 years. He is also a Brigadier General in the \nUnited States Air Force Reserves. Prior to being recently promoted to headquarters, he \nwas the former Director of Sensor Technology at the location where Applicant is \nemployed. He was in charge of the programs Applicant worked on. Applicant worked \nwith him for two and half years. They traveled together on business trips and had many \nconversations together. He states Applicant is very honest and adheres to the strict \nrules pertaining to international traffic and arms regulation as well following the \nprocedures to protect the sensitive technology of the company. (Tr at 46-52.) \n \nThe technical director and missionary at Applicant\u2019s company testified. He has \nworked in the defense industry since 1968. Applicant works in the research area. He is \nfamiliar with her work and has no cause to question her honesty. He notes she is very  \nprofessional. Her papers, proposals and interaction with others are outstanding. He has \na lot of confidence in Applicant. (Tr at 39-45.)  \n \nAn electro optics engineer who works in another branch of research department \nmet Applicant in undergraduate physics class in 1999. They have been friends for nine \nyears. She came to work for the company before Applicant. When an opening came up \nin the company she recommended Applicant for the position because she was aware of \nher educational background and intelligence.  While working at the company, they have \nworked together on various projects but do not work in the same office. She states that \nApplicant is \u201cimpeccably honest and very committed.\u201d She socializes with Applicant and \nher family. She estimated she socializes with Applicant about four times a year. It used \nto be more often but their lives are much busier. Applicant has spoken to her about her \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfamily members in Cuba a minimal amount. She is aware that Applicant\u2019s father is \nremarried and that her stepsister is a teenager. She does not know their names. She \nhas never heard Applicant express any concern for their well-being in Cuba. (Tr at 30-\n38.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s contribution to the company was recently featured in the company \nmagazine. (AE F.) Her curriculum vitae reveals that she has received several honors \nand awards, has authored numerous articles, and has had her research referenced in \nnumerous journals and proceedings. (AE E.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family was treated harshly by the Cuban government. After her \ngrandfather applied for political asylum, her mother was fired from her job as a math \nteacher.  Her family is strongly against Castro\u2019s regime. Her mother and grandfather \nsacrificed a lot so that she and her half-brother could have a future in the U.S. She \nwould never dishonor them. She loves the U.S. and feels blessed to have the \nopportunity to come to the U.S.  If granted a security clearance, she will never violate \nthe trust the U.S. government has placed in her. (Tr at 56-59, 69-70.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant \nrenewed her Cuban passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. The passport was renewed \non August 30, 2005 and did not expire until August 29, 2011. She renewed her Cuban \npassport in order to visit family members in Cuba.  Renewing a foreign passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen is considered an exercise of foreign citizenship.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies. Applicant was unaware that \npossessing a foreign passport would be an issue related to her security clearance. She \nrenewed her Cuban passport because the government of Cuba requires all of its \ncitizens, including those who have immigrated to other countries, to use Cuban \npassports while traveling to Cuba. Applicant destroyed her Cuban passport in front of \nher Facility Security Officer and presented the destroyed passport during the hearing. \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) applies. It is noted that Applicant never traveled to Cuba after renewing \nher Cuban passport. She understands that by destroying her Cuban passport she may \nnever see her family members living in Cuba again.    \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns. Guideline C is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion) applies because Applicant\u2019s father, paternal grandmother, half-sister and half-\nbrother are citizens of and reside in Cuba. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup or country by providing that information) applies for the same reason.  Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with her family members in Cuba create a potential conflict of interest \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbetween her obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and her desire to \nhelp her family members residing in Cuba.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  While Applicant has a relationship with her relatives who \nreside in Cuba, she is closest to the family members who reside in the U.S. She grew \nup in her maternal grandparents\u2019 home. Her father moved out of the house after her \nparents divorced when she was nine-years-old. She immigrated to the U.S. in 1995. \nShe completed her high school education in the U.S. She graduated from U.S. \nuniversities. She works for a U.S. company. Her significant personal and professional \nassociates are located in the U.S. She owns no property in Cuba. \n \n Although Applicant traveled to Cuba to visit family members prior to becoming a \nU.S. citizen, she has not traveled to Cuba since becoming a U.S. citizen in November \n2004. Upon destroying her passport, she accepts the possibility that she may never see \nher relatives who reside in Cuba again. Her closest family members, her mother, \nbrother, uncle, step-father and maternal grandparents reside in the U.S. Applicant has \nresided in the U.S. for 13 years. She became a U.S. citizen four years ago. She is proud \nof her U.S. citizenship and the opportunities that she has been given. She does not take \nfor the granted the rights she has as a U.S. citizen.       \n \nApplicant\u2019s close family ties, professional ties, and her future are located in the \nU.S. After weighing all of the evidence, considering Applicant\u2019s testimony, and \nobserving her demeanor at hearing, I am convinced that she would resolve any conflict \nin favor of the U.S.  \n \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under \nForeign Influence.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \n\n \n9 \n \n \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-\neducated, and intelligent woman who has a promising career ahead of her. She has \nbeen awarded her undergraduate, Masters and one PhD degree from U.S. universities. \nShe has developed strong bonds in the U.S. The intensity of those bonds was apparent \nduring the hearing based on the number of individuals who attended the hearing to \nshow their support. While she has ties of affection to her paternal grandmother, father, \nand half-sister, and infant half-brother, who remain in Cuba, her closest family members \nreside in the U.S. Her presence and demeanor at hearing revealed that she takes her \nsecurity responsibilities seriously.  After evaluating all of the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has carried her burden of mitigating the \nconcerns raised under foreign influence and foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On May 19, 2006, he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nMay 22, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 29, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 12, \n2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing on March 4, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on April 8, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 8 into evidence, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and K that were admitted into the record without \nobjection. The record remained open until April 15, 2009, to give Applicant an \nopportunity to submit more legible copies of several exhibits.  Applicant timely submitted       \nthose copies.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 15, 2009.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nLebanon. (Tr. 8-9) The request and the attached documents are included in the record \nas Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 with attachments I through XIV. Applicant did not object to \nconsideration of those exhibits. (Tr. 10) Hence, the facts administratively noticed are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1. a \nthrough \u00b6 1.c, and SOR \u00b6 2.a and \u00b6 2. b. He denied all other allegations and provided \nadditional explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After \na complete and through review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39-years old and married. He was born in Lebanon and graduated \nfrom high school in 1988.  He and his family are of the Christian faith. They moved \naround Lebanon often because of the war between Christians and Muslims. After high \nschool, he worked as a security guard for the Lebanese Forces-Christian Resistance \nGroup (aka the Lebanese Front). He was a member of and worked for the Lebanese \nFront from 1989 to 1992. (Tr. 33-34) \n \n \nThe Lebanese Front was formed in 1975 to defend Christian citizens against \nterrorist invaders of Lebanon. Initially the organization played a dual role as a defensive \nmilitary army and a political operation. In 1989, \u201cit transformed its military resistance into \na political resistance.\u201d (GE 7) In 1994, the organization was forced to disband by the \ngovernment and many of its members were arrested. Today, it continues to operate as \na political force (but not military) in many areas of the Lebanese society. (Tr. 29-31; GE \n4; 7; 8) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nApplicant came to the United States for the first time in 1984 with his mother to \nvisit his sister and brother who were living here. They stayed for one month and \nreturned to Lebanon. Later, his mother returned to the United States with immigrant \nstatus. It was her wish that all of her children would immigrate to the United States. In \nearly 1992, he arrived in the United States on an immigrant visa and went to live with \nhis brother. He started learning English and attended college, while working at various \njobs, as a laborer, pipe fitter and account manager. In July 1999, he became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. In May 2001, Applicant married his wife, who was born in \nLebanon. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2006. They have three children, \nall born in the United States. Applicant owns property in the United States, and none in \nLebanon or any other country.  \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Lebanon. His mother became a \nnaturalized U. S. citizen in 1999. She resides in the United States. His father died in \nLebanon, but was a U.S. permanent resident alien at the time of his death in 1992. His \nfather worked as a driver for an Ivory Coast ambassador before retiring. His mother is a \nhomemaker. Neither parent worked for the Lebanese Army or the Front. (GE 4) \n \n \nApplicant is one of six children, all born in Lebanon. One of his brothers is \ndeceased and one is a naturalized U.S. citizen, residing in the United States. Two of his \nbrothers are citizen residents of Lebanon. One of those brothers is a barber, but works \nas a driver for an attorney. At one point, he was captured by Muslim fighters and \ntortured.  The other brother is a school bus driver and insurance inspector. He, too, was \na security guard with the Lebanese Forces in the early 1990\u2019s. He and his wife have \napplied for visas to come to the United States. Applicant speaks to his brothers once a \nmonth. Applicant\u2019s sister became a U.S. naturalized citizen in 1981. She resides in the \nUnited States. (GE 4)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were born in Lebanon and reside \nthere. His mother-in-law is a homemaker and his father-in-law is a retired blacksmith. \nApplicant speaks to them about once a month. They came to the United States about \ntwo years ago for a visit. (Tr. 64; GE 4)  \n \n \n Applicant is loyal only to the United States and has no allegiance to Lebanon. \nHe is happy to \u201ccall himself an American citizen.\u201d (GE 4 at 5) He has fully assimilated \ninto the American culture and votes in U.S. elections. (Id.) He abhors terrorism and \nviolence, and does not support any organization that engages in such activities. (Id.) \n \n \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Lebanon several times since coming to the United States: in \n1995, 1999, 2000, and 2004. All of those visits were for pleasure and to see family \nmembers residing there. He lost his Lebanese passport years ago.1 \n \n                                            \n1 The SOR does not allege security concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, relating to \nthe use of a foreign passport after being issued a U.S. passport.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nOn October 27, 2003, Applicant completed a SF 86 for employment with a \nfederal contractor. During the process of filling out the application, he spoke with a \nsecurity officer of the company regarding how to answer the questions. During that \nconversation, Applicant told the security officer about his work for the Lebanese Front. \nShe asked him if the organization was part of the Lebanese government\u2019s army. After \nhe told her that it was not part of the army, she informed him that he did not need to \ndisclose the information because that was not the type of information that the U.S. \ngovernment was seeking in the application. (Tr. 36; 62) Hence, he did not disclose his \nemployment or association with the Lebanese Front under three sections of the \napplication: Question 11. Your Military History; Question 13. Your Foreign Activities - \nEmployment; and Question 14. Your Foreign Activities \u2013 Contact with Foreign \nGovernment. However, he did disclose a 1998 alcohol-related driving charge and ten \ndebts that were more than 180 days delinquent.    \n \n \nThe following day, Applicant went through a Counterintelligence (CI) screening \nprocess that was arranged for him through his employer. Prior to beginning the process, \nhis employer\u2019s security officer reminded him that his answers to the SF 86 and CI \nScreening Questionnaire should be consistent. (Tr. 57-58) During his conversation with \na CI interviewer, he did not mention the Lebanese Front because he did not think of it \nas part of the Lebanese government\u2019s army, based on his conversation the previous \nday. (Tr. 62) Attached to the CI Screening Questionnaire \u2013 Middle East, is a list of \nterrorist organizations. The Government requires applicants to disclose whether they \nhave been associated with said organizations or whether any of their family or friends \nhas been so associated. The Lebanese Front is not included in that list, and Applicant \ndid not write the organization in a column for \u201cOther\u201d because the Lebanese Front is not \na terrorist organization. (GE 3; Answer) He was not hired at this time because the \nemployer needed translators who spoke Farsi. (GE 4)   \n \n \nOn May 19, 2006, Applicant completed a second security application, an e-QIP, \nas part of an application with a different defense contractor. He did not disclose his \nemployment or association with the Lebanese Front under Section 17. Your Foreign \nActivities, Subsections (a) through (c), based on his previous conversations with the \nsecurity officer. He disclosed under Subsection (d) that he held a Lebanese passport \nfrom 1998 to 1999. During that same month, Applicant was hired and began working as \na bi-lingual translator his current employer, another federal contractor.   \n \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant met with a Government investigator. During that \ninterview he discussed his applications and went into substantial detail about his \nbackground and early years in Lebanon.  He disclosed his work for the Lebanese Front, \nas well as his brother\u2019s work. He talked about his other brother\u2019s capture and torture by \nMuslim terrorists. (GE 4; Tr. 70) According to a summary of that interview, he was very \ncandid. (GE 4) \n \n \nSince starting his position in May 2006, Applicant has been working a schedule \nin which he is in Iraq for six months and then returns home for two weeks. (Tr. 54) He \nspeaks Arabic, English and French. While there, he abides by all rules and regulations \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npertinent to his employment. (GE 4) He held an Interim Secret clearance until it was \nrevoked pending this proceeding. (Tr. 7) There is no evidence that he has been \ndisciplined for violating security rules or procedures. \n \n \nIn response to the falsification allegations, Applicant denied that he intentionally \nfalsified information to the Government when completing either of the applications or the \nCI Screening Questionnaire. In reviewing the CI Screening Questionnaire while \ntestifying, he acknowledged that he should have disclosed his work for the Lebanese \nFront in response to Question 15.7, because the form inquired into paramilitary \norganizations, which are not government armies, as he previously interpreted.  \nHowever, on the day he completed the form, he did not clearly understand the \ndistinction between a military (government) and a paramilitary (non-government) army. \n(Tr. 62) In response to a cross-examination question about whether he was concerned \nabout telling the truth on these forms, he said: \n \nI really had no intention whatsoever to even, you know not say something \nwhich is [not] true, because, honestly, I know that this is a background \ncheck and it\u2019s very simple. They going to come and ask, you know, my \nfriends, my relatives have he ever participated in what\u2019s not. Then from \nthem the answer is going to be yes. So why should I be lying about \nsomething as clear as the day and, you know, get myself in trouble down \nthe road. It doesn\u2019t make sense. [Sic] (Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant submitted nine letters of recommendation from his colleagues, who \nhave known him over the past three years. All of them comment favorably on his \nprofessionalism, integrity and outstanding performance. His shift supervisor and the \nsenior interrogator from June 2006 to October 2006, wrote, [Applicant] \u201cdisplayed a \ngreat amount of patriotism to the United States and a great deal of loyalty to the service \nmen and women conducting missions through Iraq. . . [his] potential to support the U.S. \nGovernment in any capacity in our current fight against terrorism is limitless.\u201d (AE C)  \nHis team leader for the period of January 2007 to June 2007 commented that \n[Applicant] is \u201cwithout a doubt the best interpreter/translator I have served with in over \n20 years of service to the Department of Defense.\u201d (AE E) Another team leader (an \narmy captain), who worked with Applicant from June 2008 to October 2008, commented \nthat \u201cHaving worked with [Applicant] on many sensitive intelligence operations, solicited \nthe input of fellow team members and observed him both on and off duty, I absolutely \nhave no reservations recommending him for [a security clearance]. I would gladly work \nwith him in any corner of the globe.\u201d (AE G) Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation, dated \nJanuary 2007, noted that Applicant exceeded all expectations during the previous \nreporting period. (AE I) \n \n \nThroughout the hearing, Applicant credibly asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship.  \nHis loyalty is to the United States. (Tr. 55) He noted that he passed a \ncounterintelligence polygraph test in 2008. (Tr. 71) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nLebanon \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which people have the constitutional \nright to change their government. It has a unicameral legislature, and a president \nelected by the legislature.  Its major elected officials have been allocated among the \nvarious religious and ethnic groups for many years, according to the Constitution and a \nlong-ago negotiated agreement among all the parties. Lebanon is located at the eastern \nend of the Mediterranean Sea in the Middle East area. It operated under a French \nmandate between World War I and II.  It was peaceful until a civil war erupted in 1975 \nbetween various religious factions. Due to this civil war the full exercise of political rights \nwere precluded from 1975 until 1991. Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong \nlaissez-faire commercial tradition. Historically, the Lebanese have been traders \nthroughout the Mediterranean. The economy is service-oriented. The U.S. enjoys a \nstrong exporter position with Lebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported good. \nMore than 160 offices representing U.S. businesses operate in Lebanon. Since the \nlifting of passport restrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened \nbranch or regional offices in Lebanon.  \n \nThe foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of \nits population and its reliance on commerce and trade. Its foreign policy is heavily \ninfluenced by neighboring Syria, which has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal \npolicies as well. For over 10 years, Syrian troops occupied part of Lebanon, and \ncontrolled its internal politics and policies.  About three years ago, Syria was forced to \nwithdraw its troops because of Lebanese opposition expressed in a popular uprising \nagainst the Syrian presence.  Syria maintains some influence in Lebanon.  The U.S. \nState Department has declared Syria to be a supporter of terrorism. Lebanon, like most \nArab states, does not recognize Israel, with which it has been technically at war since \nIsrael\u2019s establishment.  \n \nLebanon has had some human rights problems including the arbitrary arrest and \ndetainment of individuals and instances of arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life, \ntorture and other abuses. \n \nThe terrorist group Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based radical Shi\u2019a group and is \ndesignated by the U.S. as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d It is allied to and \nsupported by the Iranian Government. The Lebanese government recognizes Hezbollah \nas a \u201clegitimate resistance group and political party\u201d and until recently it was \nrepresented by elected officials in the Lebanese parliament. Hezbollah also provides \nsupport to several Palestinian terrorist organizations and is known to be involved in \nnumerous anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks. Americans have been the targets of \nnumerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon.  \n \n \nThe United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and \nto help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity. \nThe U.S. provides more than $400 million in aid to Lebanon and pledged $1 billion in \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nadditional aid. The aid reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to Lebanon\u2019s \ndevelopment as a unified, independent and sovereign country. \n \n \nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that \nimpose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. Presently there is a travel \nwarning for U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon due to the threat against westerners. \n \nPOLICIES \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nANALYSIS \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the Government\u2019s concern about foreign \ninfluence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and 2  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n  \nApplicant has telephonic contact with his two brothers and in-laws, who are \nresident citizens of Lebanon, a pro-Western country with a parliamentary democracy. It \nhas had a close relationship with the United States for many years. Nonetheless, it also \n                                            \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\ncontinues to have human rights issues and has been victimized by terrorist attacks. This \nfact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure or coercion, and a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are retired and his brothers are drivers for civilian employers. \nIn these positions, it is improbable that any of them would have any interest in acquiring \nprotected information. Only their physical presence in Lebanon creates a potential that \ntheir interests could be threatened to the point that Applicant would confront a choice \nbetween his family\u2019s interests and those of the United States. Based on Lebanon\u2019s long-\nterm friendship with the United States and the fact that Applicant works in Iraq, not \nLebanon, I find it unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and those of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) has some \napplication.  \n \nApplicant produced substantial evidence establishing the application of AG \u00b6 \n8(b).  Because of his strong connections and feelings for the United States, he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. He has lived in \nthe United States as a naturalized citizen since 1999. Prior to that time he attended \ncollege here for a period of time and held various jobs. His family, including his wife, \nmother, and two siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens, residing in the United States. He \nhas three children who were born in the United States. He owns a home in the United \nStates and has bank accounts. He votes in U.S. elections. He has worked in the United \nStates since arriving in 1992 and currently has a very good job as a translator. There is \nno evidence that he has connections or contact with any people in Lebanon other than \nhis brothers and in-laws.   \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because Applicant communicates with his two brothers \nand in-laws on a consistent basis, such that his communication cannot be construed to \nbe casual or infrequent as required under this condition. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to personal conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15:       \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant and \npotentially disqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities\u201d may raise a security concern. Applicant incorrectly answered questions \non the October 2003 SF 86, the October 2003 CI Screening Questionnaire and the May \n2006 SF 86. He denied that he intentionally falsified his answers or attempted to \ndeceive the Government.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the Government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in \nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \n \n During his testimony, Applicant acknowledged his mistakes in completing the \napplications. He explained that he sought assistance in interpreting and answering the \nquestions and believed he answered them correctly. After listening to him and observing \nhis demeanor, I find him credible.   \n \nApplicant disclosed the information about his work for the Lebanese Front to his \nemployer early in the investigative process, and later in an interview. He disclosed \nadverse information about his finances and an alcohol-related driving charge. Those \ndisclosures, along with his explanation that he received advice from a security officer \nwhile completing his first SF 86, lead me to conclude that the omission on the \n\n \n \n \n \n11\ninformation pertaining to the Lebanese Front was misguided, but not intentional. The \nGovernment could have not formulated the SOR allegations, but for Applicant\u2019s \ncomplete disclosure of his work with the Lebanese Front during a 2007 interview. \nHence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification. Accordingly, Guideline E \nis found in his favor and a discussion of mitigating conditions is not warranted.3 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): They are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who came to the United States to escape persecution \nof Christians in Lebanon and establish a better life.  He has lived in the United States for \n17 years, and has been a naturalized citizen for almost ten years. He attended classes \nat a U.S. university. He has worked in the United States since 1992 and established a \nsuccessful career. His spouse is a naturalized citizen, residing with him in the U.S.  His \ntwo children were born in the United States. Other immediate family members are \nresident citizens of the United States. He has a strong sense of patriotism toward the \nUnited States. His ties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to two \nbrothers and two in-laws living in Lebanon. There is no evidence he has ever taken any \n                                            \n3In the event a disqualification were to be found by the reviewing board, there is sufficient \nevidence in the record to establish AG \u00b6 17 (b) \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or \nconcealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, \nthe individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12\naction that could cause potential harm to the United States. His co-workers praise him \nas loyal and honest, and consider his work to be integral to the U.S. efforts in Iraq.  I \nplace great weight on those recommendations because they are submitted by persons \nwho have worked daily and in dangerous conditions with Applicant. They are in a \nposition to assess his character and conduct. \n \n Three circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  \nFirst, there is a significant risk of terrorism and various human rights abuses in \nLebanon. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile to the United \nStates and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even friendly \ngovernments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s brother to obtain such information. \nSecond, he had numerous connections to Lebanon before leaving it in 1992. Following \nhis birth, he spent his formative years there, along with his family. Third, his brothers \nand in-laws are resident citizens of Lebanon, with whom he has some contact.  \n \nApplicant has held an Interim Secret security clearance while working in Iraq up \nto recently without any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. \nWhile that fact is not normally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the \nAppeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence and personal conduct.4 Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n                                            \n4I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n13\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his foreign influence and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Section \n28.a \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \n\u201cNo\u201d in response to Section 28.b \u201cAre you currently 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \n(Item 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts: \na $997 credit card account charged off in April 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at \n3, 5); a $1,721 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection in September 2003 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 8); a $1,264 cable television account placed for \ncollection in November 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 6, 9); an $8,265 amount \nowed from an automobile repossession that was charged off in January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d: Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 6); a $676 delinquent cell phone account that was placed  for \ncollection in January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 8 at 9); and a $123,000 debt owed to the \nInternal Revenue Service for tax years 1984 \u2013 1990. (Item 8 at 4; Item 5.)   \n \nApplicant stated that he and his wife filed federal tax returns for tax years 1984 \u2013 \n1990, but did not pay the taxes owed. He also did not pay his state income taxes for \nthose years. His state tax debt was resolved through garnishment of his wages. In \n2005, Applicant and his wife hired a tax attorney. Applicant claims the attorney did not \ndo much towards resolving the tax problem. They eventually fired the attorney and \nattempted to negotiate a payment plan with the IRS on their own. At some point, they \nhired another financial company to represent them due to the complicated process. The \nIRS levied his wages in April 2007 but the levy was released in June 2007. He stated \nthat all of his other delinquent bills resulted from the IRS levy of his wages. He was \nunable to catch up on his bills. On October 18, 2007, one his sons got into trouble which \nresulted in a strain on his family finances. He intends to resolve all of his delinquent \naccounts. (Item 5; Answer to SOR.) No information was provided regarding Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial status.  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denies that he owes the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He claims to have resolved it six years ago. He provided no documentation \n\n \n3 \n \n \nverifying payment. He denies owing the cable television bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He \nadmits owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1d, and 1.e. He intends to resolve these \naccounts. He has been negotiating with the IRS pertaining to $123,000 tax debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e. The current status of negotiations is unknown. He states that he is a \nretired American soldier and would never compromise classified information. (Answer to \nSOR) \n \nApplicant claims that he did not indicate that he had delinquent debts on his e-\nQIP application due to oversight. He claims he listed the delinquent accounts in a prior \nsecurity clearance application completed in 2004, but overlooked them on his current e-\nQIP application. (Answer to SOR) He provided no information about his work \nperformance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s unresolved accounts date \nback to 1984. He owes the IRS approximately $123,000 for seven years of unpaid \nfederal income taxes. He provided no proof that the delinquent accounts alleged in the \nSOR are resolved.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s has a history of financial irresponsibility. Although he began to attempt to \nresolve his delinquent federal income taxes in 2005, he neglected to do so for over 15 \nyears. The other delinquent accounts remain unresolved. His failure to timely pay his \nfederal income taxes over a period of seven years, and his unresolved delinquent \naccounts cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues remain. He has not provided proof that any of the debts are resolved.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies because Applicant \nmentioned his son encountered some trouble in December 2007 which created a \nfinancial burden for the family. However, Applicant had unresolved delinquent accounts \nfor years prior to this event. He also states that he was unable to pay his delinquent \naccounts because his wages were levied by the IRS from April to June 2007. This is not \na circumstance beyond his control. It was within Applicant\u2019s control to pay his taxes in a \ntimely manner. In addition, the debts became delinquent several years prior to his \nwages being levied. FC MC \u00b620(b) is given very little weight.   \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  It is unlikely that his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant indicates that he intends \nto resolve these accounts but has provided no verification that any of the delinquent \naccounts were resolved. He has been working to resolve his IRS tax debt for the past \nseveral years. However, these debts were incurred between 1984 - 1990. Applicant did \nnot explain why he failed to resolve or pay his delinquent federal income tax debts prior \nto this time.     \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations to his creditors remains a \nsecurity concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days old in response to section 28(a) and his \ndelinquent debts that were currently 90 days old in response to section 28(b) on his e-\nQIP application, dated January 18, 2007. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 \n17(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \n\n \n6 \n \n \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) applies to this allegation. Applicant\u2019s explanation that he forgot to list his \ndelinquent accounts due to oversight conflicts with his testimony that he began to \nresolve his delinquent federal tax debts several years prior to submitting the e-QIP \napplication in 2007. All of the other delinquent accounts were incurred years prior to \nApplicant completing his e-QIP application. I do not find Applicant\u2019s explanations for \nomitting his delinquent debts on his e-QIP application credible. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply under Guideline E.  \n \nGuideline E is found against Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information \nabout his work performance. At the close of the record, Applicant provided little \nevidence that he has taken steps to resolve his delinquent accounts. There was \ninsufficient evidence to conclude any of the accounts were resolved. Conflicting \nstatements in the case file indicate Applicant was aware that he had delinquent \naccounts at the time he completed his e-QIP application. Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINSTAPPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 14,\n2005. On June 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nNovember 13, 2008\n\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SF-86)) at 1, 5.\n1\nId. at 2-4\n2\nItem 7 (Interrogatories and answers, dated March 28, 2008) at 5.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2008. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on July 24, 2008, and requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on September 16, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nSeptember 24, 2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He timely submitted a response\nand additional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on November 5, 2008. The\ngovernment submitted eight exhibits, which have been marked as Items 1-8 and\nadmitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and\nadmitted as Item 2. His response and attachments to the FORM are admitted into\nevidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 30, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant, who is 53 years old, works as an aircraft mechanic for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He has worked for his employer for more than 11 years. He has\nheld a clearance for the last 10 years, without any violations.  \n1\nApplicant and his wife have been married for 34 years. He has three daughters,\nages 32, 31 and 26. He served in the United States Army from 1975 until 1978. His wife\nis disabled from working, which has resulted in a reduction in family income. He\ncomplies with the laws and rules of society.  \n2\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income is $3,986. His net monthly income is $2,237\nand his wife\u2019s disability income is $755 for a total monthly income of $2,992. His\nestimated monthly expenses total $3,094. This amount includes estimates for food,\nutilities and car expenses which vary on a monthly basis. I conclude that he is able to\nmeet his monthly expenses every month.3\nThe SOR identifies six debts totaling $14,096. Applicant settled and paid the\n$256 debt listed in allegation 1.a. for $145.92 in July 2008. The unpaid cell phone bill\nidentified in allegation 1.b ($627) and 1.e ($546) of the SOR are the same account.\nApplicant paid $313.86 on the $627 bill and has a payment plan for the remainder of\n\nItem 2, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Response to form, October 2008.\n4\nItem 7, supra note 3, at 6.\n5\nItem 5 (Credit report, dated September 13, 2005) at 3; Item 6 (Credit report, dated March 10, 2007) at 4; Item\n6\n8 (Credit report, dated May 21, 2008).\nItem 5, supra note 6.\n7\n3\nthis bill. Likewise, after determining he owed the $476 debt identified in SOR allegation\n1.f, Applicant established a payment plan and recently paid $200 on this debt. The two\nlargest debts, $8579, and $3612 remain unpaid.4\nThe 2005 credit report reflects that Applicant regularly paid his monthly payment\non the voluntary car repossession debt identified in allegation 1.c. He experienced\nmechanical problems with the car when it was three years old. The repairs were\nexpensive; the company refused to pay for the repairs; and he could not afford them. He\nvoluntarily returned the car and as a result the debt was incurred. He has indicated that\nwhen his smaller debts are paid, he can begin paying this debt.  \n5\nThe $3,612 debt (SOR allegation 1.d) relates to a credit card, which became past\ndue in November 2000 and remains unpaid. Applicant has been unable to locate or\ncontact this creditor to discuss paying the debt. The most recent credit report does not\nreflect this debt and the 2007 credit report does not contain any contact information\nregarding this account, although the 2005 credit report does show contact information.6\nThe record contains three credit reports. The 2005 credit report (Item 5) shows\n37 credit entries, of which three are past due or unpaid (allegations 1.a, 1.b and 1.c in\nthe SOR) and totaled less than $10,000. This report also indicates that Applicant had\nbeen 30 to 60 days behind in his monthly payments on seven debts in the past, but that\nfour of these debts, which range for $630 to a $23,000 car loan were paid by September\n2005. The payments on the three other debts were current. The report shows that\nApplicant paid 27 debts, ranging from $190 to a $8,900 car loan and totaling\napproximately $45,000, as agreed or satisfactorily. By 2005, Applicant had paid 24 of\nthese 27 debts in full. The three remaining debts totaled about $1,000.  \n7\nThe 2007 credit report (Item 6) lists all the debts alleged in the SOR. Outside of\nthe SOR debts, this credit report reflects that Applicant timely paid, as agreed, his\nmonthly mortgage, two car loans which totaled $25,000, a $6,000 recreational debt, and\nthree small debts, which totaled $2,850. The credit report shows that he paid 57 debts\nin full. These debts ranged from $190 to $9,000 and included two car loans, nine bank\nnotes and 24 small loans. He also paid in full an $8,500 installment loan and a $23,000\ncar loan. The 2008 credit report (Item 8) lists three of the SOR debts (allegations 1.a,\n1.b and 1.c) which total less than $10,000. It also reflects that Applicant timely pays his\n\nItem 6, supra note 6; Item 8, supra note 6.\n8\n4\nmortgage, two car loans ($17,000 and $8,000) and a small loan.  This credit report\ncontains 39 entries which are closed or paid accounts with a zero balance.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Given that\nApplicant=s debts are generally more recent, this mitigation condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose when his wife became disabled from working, causing a loss in\nhousehold income. They experienced difficulty making all their monthly payments in a\ntimely fashion, but they were able to return all of their then existing debts to current\nstatus without filing for bankruptcy or refinancing. I find this mitigating condition is\npartially applicable in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). While Applicant has not sought financial\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (e) and 20 (f) are not raised in this case.\n9\n6\ncounseling, the credit reports reflect that his finances are under control. He pays his\ncurrent debts as required and agreed. Over the years, he timely paid the majority of his\ndebt. Although he has not paid an old credit card debt and the remaining balance owed\non the car he voluntarily returned to the car dealer, an overall review of his credit reports\nindicates that he lives within his financial means. He does not use credit cards to excess\nor fail to pay the majority of his loans, and he regularly pays his monthly living\nexpenses. He has resolved or is resolving his smaller debts. This mitigating condition\napplies.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Despite his\nlimited resources, Applicant has resolved one small debt and is paying two smaller\ndebts. He has attempted to contact the credit card company without success. Although\nhe has not made any effort to resolve the voluntary car repossession debt, he has made\na good faith effort to resolve his four other debts. I conclude this mitigating condition\napplies.9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant \u2018s\nthree-year-old car developed significant mechanical problems in 2006. The car dealer\nand manufacturer refused to fix the problem and Applicant could not afford the repairs.\nHe decided to return the car to the dealer and has since learned that he still owes a\nsignificant amount of money on the car loan. Due to his limited finances, he has not\n\n7\ndeveloped a repayment plan for this debt, but has indicated that once he resolves\nsmaller debts, he will work on repayment of this debt. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when his wife became disabled from\nworking, causing a loss in household income. Her disability resulted in overdue bills for\na period of time. Nonetheless, Applicant and his wife apportioned their reduced income\nto make up the missed payments and returned most of the debts to current payment\nstatus. Applicant has made an effort to resolve the remaining debts listed in the SOR.\nThe two cell phone debts listed are the same. He has paid 50% of this debt. He settled\nanother small debt and paid approximately 45% on the remaining small debt. The\ncreditor for the credit card debt never reduced it to a judgment and the Statute of\nLimitations has expired, making it uncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus, this debt\ncannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Even so, Applicant made an effort\nto locate the creditor without success. He accumulated debt due to circumstances\nlargely beyond his control when his wife could no longer work. Despite the loss of her\nincome, Applicant did not allow the majority of his bills to become unpaid debts. Rather,\nhe paid his monthly bills and continues to do so. Although he has little extra money\neach month, he has repaid or is repaying his small debts. He has a stable home life.\nBecause he has a very good track record for paying his bills, his two unresolved debts\ndo not raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) Of course, the issue is not simply\nwhether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. While some debts remain unpaid, they are\ninsufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 12 June 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF and B.  Applicant answered the SOR on 21 July 2008, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 23 October 2008. The record in this\ncase closed 5 October 2008, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.\n \nNovember 26, 2008\n\nHowever, Item 5 (the earliest credit report in the record, and the one with the most complete account\n2\nnumbers) establishes that the debts at SOR 1c. and 1.I are the same account with different alleged balances.\nAccordingly, I find allegation 1.c. for Applicant to avoid duplication of findings.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted SOR financial allegations 1.a., 1.d., 1.f., 1.h., 1.j., and all\nforeign influence allegations of paragraph 2. She denied the remaining allegations of\nparagraph 1. She is a 48-year-old administrative assistant employed by a U.S. defense\ncontractor located in South Korea since June 2006. She has not previously held a\nclearance.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, nine delinquent debts\ntotaling nearly $113,000 (Item 9).  Applicant admits four debts totaling nearly $67,000,\n2\nand admits that $20,000 of her indebtedness is due to gambling losses. Although she\ndenies five debts totaling nearly $46,000, her credit reports, her subject interview (Item\n8), and her clearance application (Item 4) establish the separate accounts owed to the\nsame creditors. Although Applicant attributes her indebtedness to her unemployment,\ninadequate support from her spouse, and low-paying jobs, the record reflects that she\nhas been continuously employed since May 2003 (except for a brief period of\nunemployment February-May 2006) and has been divorced from her spouse since\nJanuary 1987. She has not contacted any of her creditors. Except for an unnamed\ncreditor who has attached her wages for $1,700 as of July 2008, has not paid on any of\nher debts.\nApplicant was born in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in December 1959.\nHer father, now deceased, was an ambassador for the South Korean government. The\nrecord does not indicate when she immigrated to the U.S., but she became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in August 1990.\nApplicant resides in South Korea with her mother and sister, both of whom are\nresident citizens of South Korea. Her brother is also a resident citizen of South Korea.\nHer son, a U.S. citizen, also lives in South Korea. Applicant inherited a one-third interest\nin the apartment where she lives and another property from her father. She also owned\nanother apartment that she claims, without corroboration, was sold to satisfy taxes on\nher father\u2019s estate.\nThe South Korean government has an aggressive, effective intelligence-\ngathering operation that targets economic and proprietary information in the U.S.\nHowever, its human rights practices are generally respectful of democratic institutions. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n4\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (f) financial problems that are linked to\n. . . gambling problems . . . \n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n3\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which is ongoing.  Her stated reasons for her indebtedness\n4\ndemonstrate that she is unwilling or unable to live within her means, and has further\ncomplicated her finances by gambling.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not due to\n5\ncircumstances beyond her control and she has not acted responsibly in addressing her\n\n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.\u00a9 the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n9\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n10\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n11\n4\ndebts.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought\n6\nthe problem under control.  None of her debts has been paid much less paid in a timely,\n7\ngood-faith effort.  Further, given her unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling,\n8\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put her financial problems\nbehind her. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or\n9\nother foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a\nheightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.10\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B\nbecause of her close and continuing contacts with her mother, sister, brother and son,\nas well as her property interests in South Korea. In addition, although her father is\ndeceased, the fact that he was previously an ambassador for the South Korean\ngovernment suggests that her family may have more visibility to the government than if\nnone of her family members had previously served in the government at such a high\nlevel. Although South Korea is not known to specifically target its citizens to obtain U.S.\ninformation, it aggressively pursues such information.  Applicant\u2019s residence in South\n11\nKorea with her mother and sister, her property interests there, as well as her son\u2019s\nresidence in South Korea, puts her in a much more vulnerable position than if she\nresided outside South Korea. In her current circumstances she presents a potential\ntarget of opportunity that presents an unacceptable risk of being influenced to provide\ninformation. I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn May 3, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86). \nOn August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nC and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 28, 2008. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on September 25, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on September 29, 2008. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on November 6, 2008, and I received the case \nassignment on November 19, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 2, \n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 17, 2008. The \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through E and G, without objection.  \nDepartment Counsel objected to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, and I upheld the objection.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2009. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Jordan. (Tr. 219 to 221) The request and the attached \ndocuments were admitted into evidence and were included in the record as Exhibit 5. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a and 2.b, and 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f of the SOR, with \nexplanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.c of the SOR. He also \nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old, married for 33 years, and has three adult children who \nwere born in the United States.  He works for a defense contractor.  He retired from the \nU.S. Army civilian employee force in 2004.  He started working for the Army in 1975.  \nApplicant came to the United States with his parents and siblings in 1967 at the age of \n19.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 1974, having been born in \nJordan.  He has lived in the same house since 1975. (Tr. 104, 115-123, 143, 154, 196; \nExhibits 1, B, D, G) \n \n \nApplicant obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering in 1973, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in professional management in 1975.  He has always been employed \nby the U.S. Government until his retirement.  During that time period he held a security \nclearance until his retirement. (Tr. 119-122) \n \n \nSince he arrived in the United States in 1967 using his Jordanian passport, \nApplicant has maintained and used the Jordanian passport to travel to his birth place in \nJordan.  He kept the Jordanian passport after he obtained a U.S. passport when he \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen.  He maintains dual citizenship with Jordan.  His \nanswer in the 2001 security clearance application (SCA) at Question 14 states he does \nnot possess a passport from another country other than the United States, when in fact \nApplicant had the Jordanian passport.  He renewed his Jordanian passport in 2007, and \nit is valid until 2012.  He disclosed the Jordanian passport on his 2007 SCA.  None of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis supervisors between 1975 and 2004 knew he had a Jordanian passport in addition \nto his U.S. passport. (Tr. 133-136, 203-208) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Jordan and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n1982.  She maintains dual citizenship with Jordan  Applicant and his wife married in \n1976 after meeting in 1975 in Jordan on a trip he took to Jordan to see his family.  He \ntraveled to Jordan in 1976 to get married.  His wife has 13 siblings who live in Jordan.  \nBoth of her parents are deceased.  Applicant\u2019s wife visits with her siblings when she \ntravels to Jordan.  His wife has a Jordanian passport and a U.S. passport. She uses the \nJordanian passport to enter Jordan, and shows the U.S. passport at the same time to \nthe border officials in Jordan.  Applicant follows the same practice on his trips to Jordan. \n(Tr. 127, 141-156; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant has six sisters. Two sisters live in the United States.  Three sisters live \nin Jordan.  One of those sisters is married to a retired Jordanian Army colonel or \ngeneral.  Applicant is not certain about his retired brother-in-law\u2019s military rank.  The \ndaughter of another sister living in Jordan is the secretary for a Jordanian Army general.  \nShe is eligible to retire from that job. The sixth and youngest sister lives in Dubai with \nher husband who is a civil engineer.  Applicant speaks with his sisters often.  He spoke \nwith his oldest sister in Jordan the weekend before the hearing.  Applicant also had a \nbrother-in-law who was an advisor to the late King Hussein of Jordan.  This relative died \nin the 1920s.  Applicant has 2500-3000 extended family relatives in Jordan. (Tr. 163-\n187; Exhibits 1-4, B and G) \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers living in the United States.  They are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens, and maintain dual Jordanian-U.S. citizenship.  Applicant disclosed these \nbrothers and his two sisters living in the United States on his 2007 SCA, but did not \ndisclose his other siblings, claiming that the question only inquired about those relatives \nwho had U.S. citizenship and lived in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s mother, who died in \n2007, also had dual Jordanian and U.S. citizenship.  His late father also had dual \ncitizenship. (Tr. 131, 158-160, 168, 169, 198; Exhibits 1-4, B and G) \n \n \nApplicant owns his home estimated to be worth about $150,000.  He has about \n$60,000 in savings in the United States, and about $80,000 in his Thrift Savings Plan.  \nHe inherited land from his father in Jordan, valued at about $20,000.  He inherited from \nhis mother a commercial building, in joint tenancy with his brothers, in Jordan, and his \nshare is worth about $40,000 he estimates. Applicant keeps his Jordanian passport \nbecause he needs it to protect his inheritance, and to be able to buy and sell property in \nJordan, or so he understands Jordanian law to be.  About a month before his hearing, \nhe asked his ill sister in Jordan to try to sell his interest in the commercial building for \nhim.  Neither of his two brothers is interested in buying his share of the building. (Tr. \n156, 157, 189-202; Exhibits 1-4, B and G) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Jordan in 1975, 1976 to get married, in 1993, 1995, 1998, \nand 1999 when his father died.  These trips were made for the purpose of Applicant \nvisiting his family members. (Tr. 123, 137, 138, 144; Exhibits 1-4, B and G) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \nSix of Applicant\u2019s supervisors and co-workers testified for him at the hearing.  \nTen other persons submitted character statements.  The persons who testified worked \nwith Applicant for four to 20 years, and opined Applicant\u2019s work ethic is very high, and \nthat he is honest and trustworthy.  They recommend Applicant receive a security \nclearance. Applicant also submitted several certificates of appreciation and performance \nrewards. (Tr. 50-112; Exhibits C and D) \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts pertaining to Jordan.  The \ncountry of Jordan\u2019s government is a constitutional monarchy in the Middle East.  The \ngovernment has a Council of Ministers appointed by the King of Jordan.  The bicameral \nlegislature is partially elected, with an appointed Senate and elected Assembly.  Jordan \nis pro-Western in its foreign policies, and has had close relations with the United States \nfor 60 years.  It has been an independent country since May 1946.  Jordan fights \nterrorism, but has some human rights issues which include torture, arbitrary arrest, \nprolonged detention, denial of due process, and restrictions of freedoms of press, \nspeech, assembly, and movement.  The threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. \nTerrorist groups conduct intelligence gathering operations in Jordan, to undermine U.S. \ninterests.  Jordanian law also allows any male Jordanian relative to prevent a woman or \nchild from leaving Jordan, even if they are U.S. citizens. Jordan also regards dual \nJordanian-U.S. citizens as Jordanian citizens. (Exhibit 5, parts I to VI) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises:  \n \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and, \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by \nan American citizen; \n \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, \nso as to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and, \n \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other \nthan the United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce \nUnited States citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nOf these four security concerns, the facts of Applicant\u2019s case show \u00b6 10 (a) (1) \n(possession of a foreign passport) and (a) (5) (using foreign citizenship to protect \nfinancial or business interests in another country, i.e., Jordan) apply.  Applicant has held \na Jordanian passport, unbeknownst to his supervisors over the past 30 years, since he \ncame to the United States.  He did not disclose the existence of that passport in 2001 \nwhen his security clearance was renewed, having answered Question 14 on his SCA \nthat year with a negative answer.  Applicant does not want to surrender his Jordanian \npassport because he believes it protects his right to hold real estate in Jordan, including \nthe $60,000 worth of land and commercial building he owns there.  He admits he uses \nhis Jordanian passport as the primary document to travel to Jordan, showing the border \nofficials his U.S. passport as an adjunct document only during travel to Jordan. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline: \n \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in \na foreign country; \n \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when \nthe individual was a minor; \n \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United \nStates Government. \n  \n \nOf these mitigating conditions, only \u00b6 11 (a) (dual citizenship based solely on his \nparent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country) has potential applicability. However, \nbecause he continues to possess and use his Jordanian passport, it is not applicable.  \nThis condition has only limited applicability.  None of the other mitigating conditions \napply. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion; \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or \ncountry by providing that information; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that the \nindividual's access to protected information may involve unacceptable risk to national \nsecurity; \n \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; \n \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation; \n \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national; \n \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, or \nemployee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting \nto increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and, \n \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the \nindividual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country. \n \n \nApplicant has contacts with his siblings living in Jordan.  He admits he has a \nlarge family network in Jordan, consisting of 2,500 to 3,000 relatives.  His wife, a dual \ncitizen of Jordan and the U.S., also has a large family in Jordan.   Applicant is trying to \nget his sister in Jordan to sell his share of the real estate there which he owns. \nTherefore, \u00b6 7 (a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if \nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion) applies.  Applicant could be subject to pressure or coercion, \nmanipulation or inducement to his attempts to sell his property and liquidate his $60,000 \ninterest in the real estate.  He also has relatives whose spouses had high level positions \nin the Jordanian government and military forces, or whose family members work for \nthose governmental units.  \n \n \nApplicant lives with his wife, a dual citizen of Jordan and the United States. \nTherefore, he is sharing living quarters with a person, which creates a heighted risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion because of his wife\u2019s familial \nconnections in Jordan. \u00b6 7 (d) applies.  \n \n \nFinally, and most importantly, Applicant has substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interests in Jordan, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \nApplicant has $60,000 worth of ownership interest in real estate and rental property in \nJordan.  His U.S. savings account has the same amount, so this real estate value is \nconsiderable when compared to his U.S. financial holdings.  In an area in which \nterrorists are active who do not like the United States or its policies, Applicant, as a dual \ncitizen, could have his property subject to a great risk of influence or exploitation.  In his \nefforts to protect or sell the property, he might be induced to make decisions contrary to \nbest interests of the United States. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:  \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.; \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest; \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation; \n \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are \napproved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or \norganizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property  \ninterests are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \nOf these mitigating conditions, only \u00b6 8 (b) might have some limited applicability \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s long-standing connections to the United States, his 29-year work \nhistory for the U.S. Army, his ownership of a home and savings accounts in the United \nStates, and his long history of quality work at his job until his retirement in 2004 as \nattested to by his co-workers.  But, those facts are counterbalanced by Applicant\u2019s \npossession and use of a Jordanian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1974, his \nfailure to disclose the possession of that passport all the years he worked for the U.S. \ngovernment to his supervisors, and especially in 2001 on his SCA, along with his \nadamant refusal to surrender that passport until he decides he does not need it \n\n \n10 \n \n \nanymore to protect his financial interests in Jordan.  He is acting in his own personal \ninterests by making that decision.   \n \n \nIt should also be noted that Applicant did not disclose his foreign-residing siblings \non the 2007 SCA.  On the 2001 SCA he does not disclose his Jordanian passport, and \non the latest SCA he does not disclose relatives living in Jordan.  There is a pattern of \nnon-disclosure exhibited by Applicant which causes a heightened security concern.  \nLastly, none of the remaining mitigating security conditions are applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Possessing a foreign passport \nwithout disclosing its existence for 30 years by a Government employee involved in the \nwork Applicant performed, for which he was paid a salary and now receives a pension, \nwhile possessing a security clearance, is very serious conduct of long duration.  \nApplicant knew what he was doing, yet did it to protect whatever interests he might have \nin Jordan for his own financial and personal interests.  During all this time Applicant was \na highly-educated scientist and Government employee.  He refuses to surrender the \npassport, showing there is no behavioral change or attempts to mitigate his conduct.  \nThere is a great likelihood for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress as Applicant \nseeks to sell his interests in the real estate he owns in Jordan, with all its troubles in the \npresent economic situation, if in fact he is trying to sell it.  Asking a sick sister a month \nbefore the hearing is not a diligent or sincere effort to sell real estate.  His security \nconcern will continue until Applicant decides he no longer needs the passport, but \nbased on his long-term retention of the Jordanian passport, it is highly unlikely he will \never surrender this passport.  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nI considered his work history and the recommendations of his co-workers and \nsupervisors.  His good work performance over the years is insufficient to overcome \nApplicant\u2019s insistence on retaining his foreign passport even if granted a security \nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn February 6, 2007, Applicant submitted his electronic version of the Security \nClearance Application (SF 86) (e-QIP). On August 21, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 2, 2009. Applicant \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nDecember 18, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nOn October 8, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \nApplicant on October 9, 2009. He was given the opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the file on \nOctober 15, 2009.  \n \nApplicant filed a Response to the FORM on November 6, 2009 within the 30 day \ntime allowed that would have expired on November 14, 2009. He submitted documents \nincluding two employee evaluations, many customer comment forms, and four character \nletters. The Department Counsel objected to these documents. I overruled the objection \nand admitted the documents under the general category labeled \u201cResponse.\u201d  \n \nI received the case assignment on November 16, 2009. Based upon a review of \nthe complete case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all allegations in Paragraph 1 of the SOR, except Paragraph \n1.b which he partially admitted and partially denied. I considered it denied for the \npurposes of this decision. \n \nApplicant is 48 years old, married and divorced twice. He has one child. He \nworks for a defense contractor and has since January 2007. (Items 5, 6, Response) \n \nApplicant worked for a non-appropriated fund at an air base from 1998 to March \n2002.  He was terminated from that position after making statements in the workplace \nregarded by his supervisors as threatening comments.  He failed to attend some \nmandatory training, and when questioned about this lack of attendance, he became \n\u201cseriously agitated and said (he) was going to go on a killing spree.\u201d  He was escorted \noff the air base, and his employment later terminated in March 2002. (Items 5, 7) \n \nIn September 2005, Applicant worked for a charitable institution which operates \nstores selling used clothing and other merchandise to customers.  He was a store \nmanager.  His employer terminated him then for the use of profane, abusive or \nthreatening language he directed toward fellow employees, customers, guests or \nsupervisors.  Applicant was warned about his type of behavior in a letter from his \nsupervisor dated August 31, 2005. (Items 5, 7, 9, 10) \n \nApplicant was terminated by another employer, a facility service provider, in April \n2006 for testing positive for marijuana in his initial urine test conducted by his employer.  \nApplicant worked for that company four days before being terminated.  He did not list \nthis employer in his SF-86 in response to Question 11 (Employment Activities). \nApplicant also failed to list his termination by the same employer in response to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nQuestion 22 (Employment Record). Applicant did list his terminations by the two other \nemployers who fired him in 2002 and 2005. (Items 5, 7, 8) \n \nApplicant admitted in two statements he smoked marijuana from 1977 when he \nwas in high school until April 2006.  He considered it self-medication and a relaxant. \nApplicant also listed family deaths, the shooting of a friend, and a variety of personal \nmedical problems as the explanation for his behavior.  He claims he will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future. (Items 6, 7) \n \nApplicant admitted in his October 2008 statement to a government investigator \nhe was terminated by a collegiate baseball umpire association for whom he worked. His \ntermination occurred in June 2006 after he failed to return phone calls from your \nemployer seeking an umpire for a game. Applicant admitted he did not return the \ntelephone calls because he had enough work to do. Then he stated he was rehired by \nthe umpire association in October 2008.  However, Applicant submitted in November \n2009 as part of his Response a statement from the collegiate umpire association \nassociate booking agent, dated November 4, 2009, stating Applicant took a leave of \nabsence for a year and then another year from the umpire association. This booking \nagent states Applicant was never terminated by the association. In his November 6, \n2009, Response Applicant admits he was suspended from the association for failure to \nreturn the phone calls from his employer.  He also claims he was too busy to work in \n2007 and 2008, but he claims he was reinstated in 2009. I find Applicant\u2019s October 2008 \nstatement to be more credible, and that he was terminated by the umpire association. \n(Items 5, 7, Response) \n \nApplicant submitted many pages of email customer surveys and messages \npraising him for his work on a computer help desk for his current employer.  His two \nemployee evaluations dated January 2008 and January 2009, showing he meets \nexpectations as an overall assessment. His character statements praise his umpiring \nskills and that he is detail oriented in his work. (Response)   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group \n \n \nApplicant intentionally, deliberately, and repeatedly falsified information about his \nprior employment and termination by that employer on his 2007 personnel security \nquestionnaires. The reasons for his terminations by three employers are credible \nadverse information showing a pattern of inappropriate workplace behavior and rule \nviolations. This conduct creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nbecause it affects Applicant\u2019s ability to retain and obtain other employment in the future. \nI find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, an such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nApplicant did not correct his deliberate falsifications concerning his termination by \none employer and the marijuana use until confronted by the government investigator. \nThe omitted information casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment because it is material and substantive in security clearance process. Applicant \nhas not acknowledged any wrongdoing nor obtained any counseling or rehabilitation for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nhis past drug use and falsification. The information about his termination is \nsubstantiated. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult when he \ncompleted the SF-86.  Mendacity is not a virtue.  Applicant deliberately failed to make \nthe full disclosure required by the SF-86. He voluntarily omitted the termination.  There \nis no rehabilitation.  Applicant was motivated by his desire to retain his job.  Anytime any \ninformation of this nature is withheld by an applicant there is potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation or duress. It is likely that he will continue this type of falsification to \nenhance his credentials. In addition, the pattern of inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace which led to his terminations cannot be condoned. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns under the guideline for \nPersonal Conduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant 3 are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant married W in 1992 and has two children from his marriage and one step child (R.T., at 58). He served on active duty in the Navy from September 1983 through December 2005 (see exs. 1 and 2), and was honorably discharged in December 2006 with the rank of chief petty officer (R.T., at 57). Between December 2005 and December 2006, Applicant was unemployed (although attached to his Navy command) while waiting for his final navy detachment orders. In September 1990 (before his marriage to W), Applicant was caught masturbating in a movie booth by local police and was issued a citation for committing a lewd act in a public place (R.T., at 59). The reporting officer wrote in his report that Applicant could be easily observed by any person walking down the aisle, for the booth used by Applicant had no door, curtains or other barrier concealing the entryway (see ex. 5). Applicant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was fined $330.00, sentenced to three years of summary probation, and ordered to attend an AIDS counseling class (see exs. 4 and 6; R.T., at 59-60).

The\ncase was assigned to another judge on June 12, 2008, and reassigned to me on\nSeptember 4, 2008.  It was scheduled for hearing on October 6, 2008.  A hearing was\nheld on October 6, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application\nfor a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six exhibits;\nApplicant relied on three witnesses (including himself) and four exhibits.  The transcript\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on October 15, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nProcedural Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nto correct the date in subparagraph 2.d to read September 1990. For good cause\nshown, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was granted.  Applicant admitted the corrected\ndate in his own answer and did not contest the date correction. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) carried on a four-year long\nextra-marital sexual relationship with an unknown individual to which neither his wife,\nfamily, or friends are aware of, (b) refused to provide the name or the contact\ninformation of the individual he was having the affair with, and \u00a9) freely admitted that\nthis extra\u2013marital sexual relationship could be used against him if blackmailed.\nUnder Guideline D, Applicant is alleged to have (I) concealed his sexual affair\nfrom his wife, family and friends, (ii) freely admitted that this extra\u2013marital sexual\nrelationship could be used against him if blackmailed, (iii) consumed too much alcohol\non several occasions and had sexual relationships with unknown individuals, and (iv)\nwas caught masturbating in a movie booth by local police in September 1999 (corrected\nto 1990), and issued a citation for committing a lewd act in a public place. \n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with\nexplanations.  He claimed he has been monogamous with his wife for the past six\nmonths, and his relationship with the other individual was always of a casual nature.  He\nclaimed he never discussed work with this individual, and they parted ways amicably.\nHe claimed his wife, family, and friends do not know about his affair, and there is no\nneed to inform them of something that does not exist any more. \nIn his answer, Applicant claimed he recently made e-mail contact with the\nindividual and obtained permission to disclose his name.  He claimed that since he has\nworked through his own issues, there is no longer any reason to suspect or fear\nblackmail from this individual any more.  He claimed he no longer engages in excessive\nalcohol consumption or questionable activities any more.  And he claimed the 1990\nincident was an isolated occurrence before he met his future wife, and he has not\nreceived any other citations since he met and married his wife.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old-executive assistant for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\n\n3\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant married W in 1992 and has two children from his marriage and one\nstep child (R.T., at 58).  He served on active duty in the Navy from September 1983\nthrough December 2005 (see exs. 1 and 2), and was honorably discharged in\nDecember 2006 with the rank of chief petty officer (R.T., at 57).  Between December\n2005 and December 2006, Applicant was unemployed (although attached to his Navy\ncommand) while waiting for his final navy detachment orders.  \nIn September 1990 (before his marriage to W), Applicant was caught\nmasturbating in a movie booth by local police and was issued a citation for committing a\nlewd act in a public place (R.T., at 59).  The reporting officer wrote in his report that\nApplicant could be easily observed by any person walking down the aisle, for the booth\nused by Applicant had no door, curtains or other barrier concealing the entryway (see\nex. 5).  Applicant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was fined $330.00, sentenced to\nthree years of summary probation, and ordered to attend an AIDS counseling class (see\nexs. 4 and 6; R.T., at 59-60).  Applicant assures that he made W (who he was\ncohabiting with at the time) aware of the incident (R.T., at 61).  Applicant\u2019s assurances\nare credible on this disclosure issue and are accepted.\nBeginning in 2004, while still on active duty, Applicant initiated a four-year extra-\nmarital sexual relationship with a casual male acquaintance he identified as A (see ex.\n2; R.T., at 53).  Before initiating this affair with A, Applicant had never cheated on his\nwife.   In a June 2007 interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant cautioned that in\nthe event that any of his encounters were recorded, his sexual relationship with this\nindividual (A) could possibly be used against him (ex. 2).   However, he had no reason\nto believe that any of them were recorded (ex. 2).   In this interview, he told the OPM\ninvestigator that he broke off his relationship with A in May 2007 out of guilt for\n\u201ccheating on his wife\u201d (ex. 2).  He also told the investigator that neither W, his family, nor\nhis friends, had any knowledge of his relationship with A.  Noting that the relationship\nwith A had ended, he did not want to provide any contact information and identity of this\nindividual he was seeing out of concern it could hurt his marriage relationship (see ex.\n2; R.T., at 65-66).\nSince initiating his extra-marital affair with A in 2004, Applicant had an  encounter\nwith one other individual (R.T., at 62).  He provided no further details of this encounter\nor how far it went.  Although he admitted to past battles with alcohol, and several\nincidents of questionable behavior, he never provided any specifics.  The record is not\nsufficiently developed on the allegations covered by sub-paragraph 2.c to warrant any\nadverse inferences on these alcohol-related allegations.\nAsked at the hearing, whether he ever disclosed his relationship with A to W or\nhis family, Applicant indicated he had not, and had no intention of doing so now that the\nrelationship has been ended (R.T., at 65).  Applicant assures he loves his wife and has\na very good monogamous relationship with her.  He doesn\u2019t want to risk impairment of\n\n4\nthis positive marital relationship with W by disclosing his prior affairs with A, who he  has\nnot seen since his last encounter in December 2007 (R.T., at 54, 70-72). \nIn an e-mail interchange with A in September 2007, Applicant asked A a series of\nquestions about their affairs.  Responding to a question in the e-mail inquiry about how\nlong he knew Applicant, A said April 2004 to March 2007 (see ex. D).  \n When questioned further on the date of his break-up with his male partner, he\nconfirmed it was December 2007, and not March 2007, as stated by A (with Applicant\u2019s\nsuggesting) in A\u2019s e-mail response (see ex. D), or May 2007, as previously claimed  by\nApplicant in his June 2007 interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) (R.T., at 70).  When pressed at hearing to reconcile the conflicting\ntermination dates he and A provided earlier, he acknowledged concern over\nappearances of a more recent cut-off (R.T., at 80).  Applicant has never disclosed his e-\nmail to A or his e-mail account to W (R.T., at 71).\nAfter talking with his ex-partner, Applicant is now convinced that this individual\nwould never try to blackmail him (R.T., at 54-55).  Considering both the inconsistencies\nin Applicant\u2019s and A\u2019s accounts of their last encounters, and Applicant\u2019s understandable\nunwillingness to inform W of his affairs , it is not possible to discount all doubts about\nthe Applicant\u2019s potential vulnerability to blackmail at this time.\nApplicant\u2019s military service records include an excellent fitness evaluation for\n2004 (ex. C).  His evaluation assigns excellent scores for his expertise, teamwork, and\ninitiative. \nApplicant is well regarded by his employer.  His direct supervisor describes\nApplicant as a fine performer (R.T., at 6-10).  His program manager rates him as top tier\nperformer (R.T., at 17-19).  Applicant\u2019s 2008 performance appraisal assigns a solid\nrating in some categories and an excellent rating in others (ex. A). His rater\ncharacterizes him as honest and reliable, with a good attitude, and one who works well\nwith others (see ex. A). His rater also praises Applicant for his exceptional\ncommunication skills and outstanding team work (ex. A).  Applicant is credited with\ncompleting an acquisition course in August 2008 (see ex. B).  \n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\n\n5\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  See Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nSexual Behavior\nThe Concern. Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense,\nindicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or\nwhich may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  No adverse\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  See Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG),  \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\n\n6\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious defense contractor employee who pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor public indecency charge in 1990 and beginning in 2004 was involved in a\nfour-year series of extra-marital affairs with another individual without telling his wife and\nfamily.  Applicant admitted to risks of blackmail over his affairs in an OPM interview and\nrepeated his intention to withhold the information about these affairs from his wife.\nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s 1990 conviction, his four-year sexual extra-\nmarital relationship with A, and allegations pertaining to his consuming alcohol and\nhaving sexual relationships with other unnamed individuals. \nApplicant\u2019s actions raise security concerns under both the personal conduct and\nsexual behavior guidelines.  DC \u00b6 16(e) of Guideline E, \u201cPersonal conduct or\nconcealment of information that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . .,\u201d is applicable to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation.  While much of Applicant\u2019s conduct is covered by Guideline D and can be\nresolved under that Guideline, there are several allegations under each guideline that\nare not incorporated in the other.  For example, subparagraph 1.a that addresses\nApplicant\u2019s four-year extra-marital affair is not incorporated in the Guideline D\nallegations.  Vice versa, subparagraphs 2.c (addressing alcohol-related sexual\nrelationships) and 2.d (covering Applicant\u2019s 1990 citation) are alleged under sexual\nbehavior but not under personal conduct. \nJudgment and blackmail concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s four-year sexual affairs\nspanning 2004 and 2007 with A that he has declined to explain to his wife.  These\nactions reflect both serious judgment lapses and actions that expose him to risks of\npotential blackmail.  Applicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by Guideline E, and are\nentitled to independent cognizance under this Guideline according to the Appeal Board.\nSee ISCR Case No. 06-20964, at 6 (April 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is additional\nprobative adverse information covered by Guideline E that is not covered by Guideline D,\nand vice versa, and which reflects a recurring pattern of questionable judgment,\nirresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior, independent grounds do exist for\nconsidering questionable judgment and trustworthiness and exploitation and coercion\nrisk allegations under Guideline E and Guideline D, respectively.  Authority for\nconsidering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is contained in the guidance\nprovided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006 amendments. \n\n7\n So, under Guideline E, core judgment and exploitation concerns covered by D.C.\n\u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information,\u201d are applicable in this case\nTurning to the specific allegations covered by Guideline D (several of which\noverlap with those under Guideline E), the pertinent ones associated with Applicant\u2019s\n2004-2007 extra-marital affairs with A are covered by several of the disqualifying\nconditions in Guideline D.  Applicable to the particular facts surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nextra-marital affairs are  DC \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not\nthe individual has been prosecuted,\u201d DC \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an\nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and DC \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual\nbehavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d  \nAdditional allegations covering alcohol-related sexual relationships separate and\napart from his extra-marital affairs with A were never developed in the record and lack\nany probative  evidence.  As such, these allegations covered by subparagraph 2.c are\nconcluded to be unsubstantiated.  \nTo be sure, Applicant is of record in advising W of his 1990 citation and public\ndecency conviction before their marriage.  While this reduces his vulnerability risk to\ncoercion and pressure, it does not resolve concerns about his judgment and\ntrustworthiness.  His 1990 conduct reflects not only poor judgment but a reckless\ndisposition towards imprudent sexual misbehavior that manifested itself years later in his\nseries of extra-marital affairs with A.  Such conduct cannot be compartmentalized on a\npiece-meal basis and isolated from one another.  Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s\nbehavior over a 15-year period, his actions reflect considerable recurrence risks\nassociated with his judgment lapses and sexual behavior that make him vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.  This collective pattern of recurrent behavior are\nindependently covered by the disqualifying conditions previously set forth under\nGuideline D.  \nBoth judgment lapses and blackmail risks remain key Guideline D concerns.  For\nApplicant has never disclosed his sexual encounters with A over the past four years out\nof concern for his wife and their marriage.  His concerns are quite understandable.  But\nhis declinations to inform his wife of his encounters with A also increase his vulnerability\nto coercion, exploitation and duress.  Neither the private, discreet nature of Applicant\u2019s\nsexual encounters with A, Applicant\u2019s assured cessation of the encounters, nor A\u2019s\nreported disinclination to make any trouble for Applicant absolve Applicant of potential\nrisks of compromise or coercion associated with his encounters with A.   \nThe recurrent judgment lapses that inhere in Applicant\u2019s 1990 public indecency\nconviction and more recent extra-marital affairs, and Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his\n\n8\nextra-marital encounters to W, preclude safe predictive judgments at this time that he will\nnot engage in any similar activity in the foreseeable future.  Neither the timing of his\nactions, the accompanying circumstances, the recurrence risks, nor the still potential for\nblackmail warrant the application of any of the mitigating conditions in Guideline D or\nGuideline E.  So recurrent and recent are his encounters that the likelihood of their\noccurring again cannot be safely discounted.  As long as risks of recurrence and\nblackmail exist, Applicant\u2019s conduct cannot be mitigated, either under the guidelines or\nunder the whole person concept.  \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established a good relationship\nof trust with his employer.  Both his direct supervisor and his program manager\ncharacterize him as a good performer and strong team player.  These are qualities that\nserve him well in fulfilling his fiducial responsibilities in protecting accessed classified\ninformation. Applicant credibly makes the case, too, to his making renewed efforts to\nstrengthen his marriage, but at a price.  For in doing so, he is determined to withhold\ninformation about his sexual encounters (casual as they may be) that could impair or\nweaken his marital relationship.  While understandable, his reluctance to inform his wife\nalso places him at continued risk to pressure, coercion, or duress (core security\nconcerns). \nIt is true that Applicant\u2019s telling his wife about his affairs may well pose something\nof a Hobson\u2019s choice for him.  Informing her of the details of his encounters, though, is a\nnecessary prerequisite to absolving himself of risks of blackmail and other forms of\npressure and coercion.  This is a situation where strong work and family credits cannot\novercome the security risks associated with his undisclosed sexual relationships with A.\nTaking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s recurrent\nsexual encounters in the 1990 time frame and more recently spanning 2004 and 2007,  it\nis still too soon to absolve Applicant of security risks associated with his recurrent 2004-\n2007 sexual encounters with A. Based on his recurrent actions reflecting questionable\njudgment and trustworthiness concerns, and his continued unwillingness to disclose his\naffairs to his wife, Applicant does not mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the underlying conduct covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of Guideline E  and subparagraphs 2.a, 2.b and 2.d of\nGuideline D.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 2.c. of\nGuideline D.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors enumerated in Enclosure 2(a) of the Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n9\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\n \nSub-para. 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE D: (SEXUAL BEHAVIOR):                   AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a::\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 2.b::\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 2.c::\nFor Applicant\nSub-para. 2.d::\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 18, 2009. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on April 3, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 1, 2009, and I received \nthe case assignment on June 5, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 26, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 14, 2009. The Government offered \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through I, without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 23, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the \nrecord open until July 31, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On July 31, 2009, he \nsubmitted Exhibits J to S, without objection. The record closed on July 31, 2009. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 3, 2009, Applicant admitted 19 factual \nallegations in the SOR, with explanations. He denied the four factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He is widowed, his wife dying of heart problems in \n2005. He has two adult sons from that marriage. Applicant has custody of a 14-year-old \nfoster child. He has a boarder in his home that has two minor children. The boarder \nhelps take care of the foster child because of Applicant\u2019s extensive business travels.  \nShe does not pay rent or any other expenses, and does not work outside the home. \nApplicant rents a home. He works for a defense contractor beginning in March 2006. \n(Tr. 30-32, 41-46; Exhibits 1, A) \n \n \nApplicant has had a security clearance at the Secret level since 1972. Applicant \nalso served in the National Guard from 1972 to 1978. He has not had any security \nviolations or compromises of classified information during those 37 years. He has been \na courier and a facility security officer at times for various employers. Applicant worked \nfor a defense contractor until 1995, when he volunteered to terminate his employment \nwith a buy-out when his employer merged with another defense contractor. He did \nindependent consulting work from 1995 to 1998 while also working for a defense \ncontractor. In 1998, Applicant again was employed by a third defense contractor. That \nemployment ended in October 2004 when he was laid off when a contract was not \nrenewed.  Applicant was unemployed from 2004 to March 2006. (Tr. 18, 22, 32-36, 48, \n49, 80; Exhibits 1, B, C) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife lived separately from 1999 to 2002 after she moved back \nto a neighboring state to be able to care for her sick mother. Applicant had a residence \nin their original state, while renting another one in the state in which they lived together \nuntil 1999. Applicant believes his family financial problems started during that time \nperiod. His wife managed the family finances during their marriage which started in \n1972. His wife used their money to supplement her mother\u2019s income to pay for medical \nnecessities, which Medicare did not pay. Applicant\u2019s household debts were not being \npaid regularly because of his wife\u2019s diversion of funds to care for her mother and her \nspending habits with their credit cards. Applicant\u2019s wife also suffered from depression \nover her mother\u2019s medical condition and her own health problems. Applicant became \naware of the situation in 2002, and attempted to repay some creditors. Applicant gave \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis wife $60,000 from his employment separation package in 1995 to pay the debts. His \nwife spent $15,000 buying a time-share arrangement. He does not know how she spent \nthe other $45,000. (Tr. 36-41, 47, 48, 50, 80, 99; Exhibits 1, 4, A) \n \n \nAfter his job loss in October 2004, Applicant withdrew funds from his Internal \nRevenue Code, Section 401(k), retirement account. He lived on those funds for 16 \nmonths of his 18-month period of unemployment. During that time period and into late \n2006, Applicant attempted to negotiate debt repayment plans with various creditors.  \nAccording to him, none of them would accept monthly payments without sizeable down \npayments. After being employed in March 2006, Applicant decided to concentrate his \navailable funds on his monthly expenses and paying the education costs at a state \ncollege for his second son. His expenses were $350 monthly for tuition costs not \ncovered by the Pell grants his son received, which paid for two-thirds of his tuition, and \nanother $300 monthly for the son\u2019s car and cell phone. Applicant attributes his lack of \naction towards debt resolution from 2006 to the present to his business travel schedule, \nand a sense of depression after the death of his wife in 2005. (Tr. 48, 49, 54, 59-62, 66, \n78, 79, 87; Exhibits 1, 4, 5, A) \n \n \nApplicant earns a $76,000 annual salary. His take home pay after taxes is $3,800 \nmonthly. He has no credit cards. His rent is $1,200. He pays $400 monthly on a car loan \nfor a car, which was stolen from him at his apartment. The amount owed is $12,000. His \nutilities are $250 monthly, cable television is $105 monthly, his monthly food costs are \n$400, his auto insurance is $67, and his gasoline cost is $120 monthly. His net \nremainder is $958, less the $400 monthly for the stolen car.  He has an older car he \nuses to go to work that is fully paid. From the $558 remainder, Applicant is also subject \nto a $1,250 monthly garnishment order. Because that order took more money than \nApplicant had available each month, he negotiated a monthly payment plan to replace it \nby paying $150 monthly starting in July 2009. The creditor took $327 from Applicant\u2019s \nbank account pursuant to a non-wage garnishment. The garnishment order pertains to \nSOR \u00b6 1.u for $3,328.85. Applicant, when he could not negotiate installment payment \nplans with some of his creditors, decided to let the cases go to court because he \nthought the court would \u201carbitrate\u201d the amounts and give him a reasonable repayment \nplan. Instead, the same collector obtained two garnishment orders against his income to \ncollect their two debts. Those debts were the SOR \u00b6 1.u debt and the SOR \u00b6 1.m debt \nfor $5,612. (Tr. 71-76, 81-96; Exhibits 2, 3, D, E, O)  \n \n \nApplicant has 23 delinquent debts with a total value of $43,383. These debts \nbecame delinquent in 2005 and thereafter. They arose earlier than that year, because \nhis wife incurred most of the debt from 2000 to 2005 when she failed to pay the family \ndebts while spending that money on her mother\u2019s care. After the July 14th hearing, \nApplicant developed a repayment plan for all of his debts. The repayments started in \nJuly or August 2009, and the longest repayment schedule is 53 months, ending in \nJanuary 2014. Most of the debts will be repaid in 2010 and 2011. Applicant is actively \npaying nine delinquent debts listed in the SOR, with a total value of $18,830.  Almost all \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are credit card debts. (Tr. 52-58, 63-69, 111; Exhibits 2-\n5, J - S) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nThe debts Applicant is actively paying now according to his plan are: \n \n1. A credit card debt for $5,201 on a $100 monthly installment plan, \nstarting in July 2009 (Para. 1.d). (Exhibits 3, O-5, S) \n2. A repossessed automobile in the amount of $3,339, starting in July \n2009 for $100 monthly (Para. 1.f) (Exhibits 2, 3, O-5, S) \n3. A lease deposit which he co-signed for one of his foster children, now \nan adult, in the amount of $418.  The debt was supposedly resolved in \n2002 with no obligation by Applicant. He denied his liability on this debt \n(Para. 1.j). (Exhibits 2, 3, J, S) \n4. A credit card debt in the amount of $5,612, the subject of a \ngarnishment order on a judgment rendered in April 2008.  Applicant \npays $150 monthly starting in July 2009 (Para. 1.m). (Exhibits 2, 3, E, \nO, S) \n5. A bank overdraft being collected by a creditor in the amount of $114.  \nThe account was closed in 2005. Applicant settled the debt for $34.34 \nand paid that amount on July 25, 2009, by a money order (Para. 1.o). \n(Exhibits 2, Q, S) \n6. Applicant paid a cellular telephone bill on July 30, 2009, for a \nsettlement amount of $25.39.  The original debt was $50 (Para. 1.q) \n(Exhibits 2, 3, Q, S) \n7. Applicant paid $59 for a \u201cbounced\u201d check in the amount of $58 paid to \na pizza establishment.  Applicant denied he owed the debt, but paid it \nanyway on July 30, 2009, with a money order (Para. 1.s). (Exhibits R, \nS) \n8. Applicant owes a mail order catalog company $642.  He denied this \ndebt.  Applicant pays $27 monthly on this account.  He has made three \npayments (Para. 1.t). (Exhibits 2, P, S) \n9. Applicant owes the same creditor as listed in SOR Para. 1.m (see \nparagraph 4 in this list) for another debt of $3,396.  A garnishment \norder was issued on this account. The judgment was rendered in \nFebruary 2009. Applicant pays $150 monthly on this account, starting \nin July 2009 (Para. 1.u). (Exhibits 2, 3, D, O-3, S)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s repayment plan for the remaining 14 debts has his monthly payments  \nfor several months being $1,320 during 2010 and 2011. As the delinquent debts are \nrepaid, he will have additional funds to dedicate to repaying the remaining debts in 2011 \nand 2012.  Those debts are set forth in SOR Para. 1.a to 1.c, 1.e, 1.g to 1.i, 1.k. to 1.l, \n1.n, 1.p, 1.r, 1.v and 1.w. (Exhibit S) \n \n \nApplicant submitted four character letters from two co-workers and two \nsupervisors from his current employer. They all state Applicant is a very hard-working \nemployee with an excellent character and possessing the highest integrity. The letters \nalso state Applicant acted as a mentor to the writer or to other persons in the \norganization.  Applicant made forthright and credible presentation of his financial history \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand family situation. He did not make excuses for his actions, but testified that the \nproblems were his fault and his to fix by repaying the debts. (Tr. 18, 60, 66, 87; Exhibits \nF to I)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes nine disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of these nine conditions, three are potentially applicable. \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Applicant admitted he could not negotiate reasonable repayment plans \nwith the 23 creditors between 2006 and 2009, and he then gave up the effort. \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may \nraise security concerns. Applicant accumulated $43,383 of delinquent debt in 23 \nseparate debts since 2002 and was unable to pay these obligations regularly since \nthen. Applicant\u2019s debts date from 2005 at least. They remain unresolved, except for \nthree he settled for lesser amounts than originally owed.  \n \nFinally, under AG \u00b6 19 (e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means, which may \nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d applies because of the magnitude of \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt attributable to excessive spending. He has been unable to \nrepay the debt since 2005 because of insufficient income. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  \n \nThe same guideline also includes six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Of these mitigating conditions, three \nconditions are potentially applicable.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbetween 2000 and 2001, but first came to his attention in 2002. He accumulated \ndelinquent debt due to his wife=s spending on her mother and credit card purchases she \nmade when she lived separate from Applicant between 1999 and 2002 before she died \nin 2005, and his unemployment from 2004 to 2006. Almost all of the debt arose \nbecause of his wife\u2019s imprudent spending and neglect of their financial obligations.  She \ntook out many credit cards, and charged purchases on them, while not making regular \npayments. Depression, resulting from her mother\u2019s death, and her subsequent heart \nillness, deterred Applicant\u2019s wife from faithfully executing her household financial \nmanagement duties. These circumstances are no longer extant. I find the behavior \noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not \nraise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The \nevidence raises this potentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, most of \nthe financial problems arose from his wife=s medical problems and her spending habits, \nher desire to take care of her mother before she died in 2000, and Applicant\u2019s 18- \nmonth period of unemployment from 2004 to 2006. Applicant relied, to his detriment, on \nhis wife to continue her usual practice of paying their debts in a regular and timely \nfashion. He gave her $60,000 in 2001 to make payments on the debts.  Instead, she \nspent it on a time share property and various purchases. In 2002, he discovered she \nwas not paying the family debts, and assumed the responsibility to try to make \npayments.  He was meeting those obligations until his unemployment in 2004. He acted \nresponsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating \ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has a \nrepayment plan which he devised by July 31, 2009.  He is paying on the debts. His \ncommitment expressed at the hearing, coupled with his credibility and character \nstatements, show he has the intent to effectuate his repayment plan. Applicant\u2019s net \nincome without the garnishment orders can tolerate that outlay monthly if he closely \nmonitors his expenses. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a mature adult when \nthe delinquent debts became due. But for the 30-year duration of his marriage he \ntrusted his wife to pay the monthly debts. They lived separately in two different states as \nhe earned the income necessary for the family to live.  He had two sons to educate in \ncolleges.  He trusted his wife, and she betrayed that trust.  Perhaps she did not do so \nintentionally, because she suffered from her own physical ailments while her aged \nmother was also ill.  Applicant\u2019s wife devoted their income to caring for her mother, and \nmaking herself feel better by incurring debt as she made various purchases. Applicant \ndoes not seem to have been the spender in the family.  \n \nWhen Applicant discovered the problem, he attempted to rectify it by paying the \ndebts from 2002 onward. The loss of his job in October 2004 compounded and \ncomplicated his repayment plans at that time. He drained his retirement account to \nsustain himself and his family, and finally found employment in March 2006.  By then, \nhis wife had died, and he felt obligated to pay for his second son\u2019s college education as \nhe had for his first son.  Applicant also had a foster child and three other persons for \nwhom he cared.  He attempted again to negotiate repayment plans with his creditors, \nbut they wanted large down payments before agreeing to monthly installment payments, \nbecause the debts had aged so much. At that point in the discussions, Applicant gave \nup his efforts and did not renew them until recently. He acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances of his traveling for business, his wife\u2019s death, and the burdens of \nsupporting his foster child, natural children, and his boarder with her two children. The \nevidence supports a finding that he will not renege on his payment plan, as he is aware \nthat future financial issues could have an adverse effect on his employment. \n \nApplicant is not a security risk based on his 37 years of having a security \nclearance.  During that time there have been no breaches of security or violations of \nprotocols by Applicant. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept in his favor.  \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.w:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 3, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology\nSystems) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a disposition on the written record.  On October 21,\n2009, after the close of the evidentiary record, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nThe Judge found that despite the fact that Applicant\u2019s company prohibited the accessing and\ndownloading of pornographic materials on company computers, pornographic material was found\non Applicant\u2019s work computer in May 2006.  Applicant was a facility security officer at the time.\nApplicant also failed to file a state income tax return for tax year 1998.  He subsequently filed the\nreturn, paid his penalties and resolved the debt.  Applicant also used marijuana about 20 times from\nSeptember 1996 until December 2000.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s accessing, viewing\nand downloading of pornography on his company computer was not mitigated and was made worse\nby the fact that, at the time, he was the facility security officer and was responsible for the company\u2019s\ncompliance with security procedures, its security posture, and proper use of computer systems.  The\nJudge concluded that Applicant\u2019s tax delinquency and marijuana use were no longer of security\nsignificance.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain inaccuracies, namely the finding\nthat the hardest thing about his viewing of pornography was having to tell his wife about it, the\nfinding that he failed to mail his 1998 state tax return, and the finding that his last admitted use of\nmarijuana was in 2000 as opposed to 2003.  Applicant also argues that the record and a whole person\nanalysis mandate a conclusion that his case has been mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s claims do not establish\nharmful error on the part of the Judge.\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nwhich the Board cannot consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or\nconsidered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).\nInasmuch as the Judge ultimately found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the tax return and\nmarijuana use allegations, and resolved them favorably in his whole person analysis, any errors in\nthe Judge\u2019s findings of fact regarding these two allegations are harmless.  Regarding the alleged error\nin the Judge\u2019s finding of fact relating to the accessing pornography allegation, the Judge\u2019s finding\nis supported by the evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments concerning mitigation do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of Guideline M mitigating conditions and\n\ncogently explained why there was insufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  He also discussed the inapplicability of Guideline E mitigating conditions as they related\nto the pornography allegation.  His conclusions are reasonably supported by the record evidence. \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) as part of his employment with a defense contractor on May 5, 2007 (Item 4).  \nOn June 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines M (Use of \nInformation Technology Systems) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) (Item 1). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 10, 2009 (Item 2).  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 24, 2009. He admitted all the \nallegations with explanation, and elected to have the matter decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \nwritten case on July 20, 2009. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material \nOctober 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n(FORM) on August 5, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns by September 16, \n2009. Applicant timely submitted additional information. The case was assigned to me \non September 21, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file and the pleadings, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under Guidelines M and E. The \nallegation under Guideline M involves the use of a company computer to access, view, \nand download pornographic material in violation of company policy. The Guideline E \nviolations include use of the company computer to access pornographic material in \nviolation of company policy, the use of marijuana between September 1996 and \nDecember 2000, and a state tax lien placed against him in June 1998. I thoroughly and \ncarefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings. I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and a security consultant for a defense contractor. He \nhas worked in various capacities as a security consultant in the defense industry for \nover five years. He was granted access to classified information in 2005, but his access \nwas revoked in May 2006. It appears from the file that he may have been granted \ninterim access to classified information after 2006. He is married with at least one child. \nHe served four years on active duty in the Navy and received an Honorable Discharge \n(Item 4, e-QIP).   \n \n \nApplicant was a facility security officer for a defense contractor in May 2006, \nwhen pornographic material was found on his computer. His company's policy prohibits \naccessing and downloading pornographic material using a company computer. \nApplicant was immediately terminated from his position as the facility security officer \n(Items 5 and 6). Applicant admits the conduct but feels he has been sufficiently \npunished. He feels he is not a threat to national security and has been punished \nenough. Applicant may have been granted interim access to classified information by \nanother defense contractor within a month of being terminated by his previous \nemployer. He has continued to work in security since June 2006, been promoted, \nreceived raises, and advanced to a senior security specialist. In this capacity, he has \nadvised and assisted other government agencies with security issues. Applicant stated \nhis worst problem concerning the pornographic material was telling his wife. However, \nshe has been supportive. (Response to FORM, received DOHA September 8, 2009).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to file a state income return for tax year 1998. \nApplicant completed his federal and state tax returns as normal. He thought he had \nmailed both forms. He received a federal tax refund and thought he had received his \nstate tax refund. When he was advised by the state that he had not filed the return, he \nlooked for his return to verify it had been filed. Instead, he found his state tax return still \nin the envelope in the file ready for mailing. Applicant mailed his state tax return, paid \nthe penalties, and the debt is resolved (Response to FORM, received DOHA September \n8, 2009). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana about 20 times from September 1996 until \nDecember 2000. Applicant was in his early 20s at the time. He has not used marijuana \nsince January 2003, and regrets the use of marijuana while he was a young man. He \nalso was concerned because his father used drugs during the Vietnam era and recently \ndied of throat cancer (Response to SOR, dated June 24, 2009; Response to Form, \nreceived DOHA, September 8, 2009). \n \n \nApplicant informed his wife of his conduct concerning pornography and the \nreasons he was terminated. He uses himself as an example when he teaches classes \nas a security consultant of the security consequences of drug abuse and misuse of \ninformation technology. He is involved in community activities of his homeowners' \nassociation and neighborhood watch. He is also more active in his church. The facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) for one of the companies he advises noted that Applicant is a \nprofessional dedicated to his work. He does not question Applicant's loyalty and does \nnot consider Applicant a danger with managing classified information. Applicant has \nensured that the facility security officer's company stays in compliance with security \nrequirements. He discussed Applicant's prior conduct with him and he is convinced that \nApplicant's inappropriate conduct will not happen again (Response to FORM, received \nDOHA September 8, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n4 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to \ninformation technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to properly \nprotect sensitive systems, networks and information (AG \u00b6 39). Applicant's conduct in \naccessing, viewing, and downloading pornographic material on a company computer in \nviolation of company policy raises Information Technology Disqualifying Condition (IT \nDC) \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem).   \n \n \nI considered Information Technology Mitigating Conditions (IT MC) AG \u00b6 41 (a) \n(so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); IT MC AG \u00b6 41 (b) (the \nmisuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational efficiency and \neffectiveness, such as letting another person use one's password or computer when no \nother timely alternative was readily available); and IT MC AG \u00b6 41(c) (the conduct was \nunintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct \nthe situation and by notification of supervisor). I find that none of the mitigating \nconditions \napply. \nApplicant \ndeliberately \naccessed, \nviewed, \nand \ndownloaded \npornography on his company computer in 2006. He was then the facility security officer \nresponsible for the company's compliance with security procedures and its security \nposture. It was done for his own gratification and not to advance any company \nprograms or issue. This breach of the technology system in violation of company policy \nis even more serious since Applicant was the company facility security officer. It was his \nduty to ensure the security worthiness of his company and the proper use of their \ncomputer systems. I find against Applicant as to Guideline M. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern because \nit asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence the person \ncan be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  \n \n \nApplicant's downloading of pornographic material in violation of company policy, \nhis use of marijuana, and his failure to file a state income tax return raises Personal \nConduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in \nseveral adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under \nany single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safe guard protected information); PC DC AG \u00b6 16(d) \n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and \nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined \nwith all available information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to \nconsideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations); and PC DC AG \u00b6 16(e) \n(personal conduct or concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities \nwhich, if known, may affect the person's personal professional, or community standing). \nThis type of conduct, whether known or not, involves questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nThese events raise concerns about Applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information.   \n \n \nI have also considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) AG \u00b6 \n17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment); and PC MC AG \u00b6 19(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress). Much time has passed \nsince Applicant used marijuana. He has not used the drug since January 2003, over six \nyears ago. His last use happened a long time ago and there has been an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence. His past marijuana use is unlikely to recur and does not now cast \ndoubt on his trustworthiness or reliability. His failure to file a state tax return was a one-\ntime inadvertent occurrence. I find that Applicant mitigated the security concerns about \nhis failure to file a state tax return and marijuana use.  \n \n \nHowever, Applicant misuse of information technology systems in violation of \ncompany policy has not been mitigated. He used his company computer in violation of \n\n \n6 \n \ncompany policy prohibiting download of pornographic material. This is a serious breach \nof company policy as well as personal conduct that is questionable and shows an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. This conduct occurred in 2006, only \nthree years ago. Applicant was then his company's facility security officer. He knew and \nunderstood the ramifications of his conduct for his security clearance. Knowing this, he \nstill accessed, viewed, and downloaded pornographic material. This offense happened \nrecently and is serious. It can recur at any time and at the stroke of a computer key. I \nfind against Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonssense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.   \n \n \nApplicant has not established that he is trustworthy, reliable, and exercises good \njudgment. To the contrary, his accessing, viewing, and downloading pornographic \nmaterial on a company computer when he was the facility security officer is a strong \nindicator that he will be untrustworthy, unreliable, and use poor judgment in the \nmanagement of classified material. He has established that his past use of marijuana \nand his inadvertent failure to file a state tax return in 1998 is not of security significance. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his misuse of technology information systems and \npersonal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He told the police after he was \narrested that he had started stealing the parts about 18 months before he was arrested. \nApplicant estimated the value of the property he stole at about $7,000.4  \n \n \nApplicant expressed remorse and embarrassment about his crimes. There is no \nevidence of any other arrests or other involvement in criminal activities. Applicant\u2019s \nfriends and family are aware of his criminal record.5 \n \n \nThe SOR, with the amendments, allege the Financial Considerations concerns \nas Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy, nine delinquent debts, with balances totaling about $23,824, \nand a home mortgage that was $1,000 past due. Applicant admitted owing the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j. He denied owing the debts in the other \nallegations.  \n \n \nApplicant established that he has paid or settled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, \n2.c, 2.e, 2.f, and 2.h. Several of the debts were paid in 2008. The total amount of those \ndebts, as alleged in the SOR, is $2,390. On March 2, 2010, he brought his home \nmortgage current with three payments of $1,049 each. That debt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.j. He established that the $10,370 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g was discharged in his \n2003 bankruptcy.6 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $420 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k. This debt \nwas listed on an Experian credit report obtained on May 20, 2009. It is not listed on the \nEquifax credit report obtained on December 16, 2009.7  \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 28, 31-36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Tr. at 35-36; GE 3. \n \n6 Tr. at 40-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A(1)-A(13). \n \n7 Tr. at 45; GE 6, 7. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has two remaining delinquent debts to be resolved. SOR \u00b6 2.d alleges \na delinquent student loan of $8,390 owed to the vocational school he attended. He \nsubmitted documentation that he has requested a graduated repayment plan for student \nloans administered by Sallie Mae, requesting two years of reduced payments. He stated \nhe has been unable to contact the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 2.d, but he is continuing \nhis efforts. It is unclear if the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 2.d represents the same loans \nadministered by Sallie Mae or a different loan.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $2,254 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.i. Applicant\u2019s wife \nhad an accident in their car, resulting in a total loss. The amount still owed on the car \nloan after the insurance paid the fair market value of the car was $2,254. Applicant \nmade payment arrangements to pay this debt with 24 monthly payments of $100. He \nmade a payment of $100 on March 23, 2010.9 \n \n \nApplicant attributed the financial problems that led to his bankruptcy to his first \nwife and his divorce. His current wife returned to school to be a nurse. Applicant and his \nwife knew they could not pay all their debts while she was in school. They decided they \nwould be better off in the long run if they sacrificed paying their debts while she was in \nschool, and then pay them after she started working as a nurse. Applicant\u2019s wife is now \nworking and attending school part-time. Applicant has not received financial counseling. \nHe and his wife can pay their current bills with their income, but they do not have much \nexcess. He anticipates paying his remaining delinquent debts with his overtime pay.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 24, 36-38; GE 1, 2; AE A(14), A(15). \n \n9 Tr. at 43-44; AE A(14), A(16).  \n \n10 Tr. at 30, 37-39, 45-53; GE 3. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant committed serious crimes when he stole about $7,000 worth of parts \nand equipment from his employer. Both of the above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished.  \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior happened about six years ago. It was not an \nisolated event because it occurred on numerous occasions over an extended period. \nThere is no evidence of any other arrests or similar behavior. Applicant appeared \nsincerely remorseful and embarrassed about his crimes at his hearing. He successfully \ncompleted the terms of his community supervision. He attended vocational school in \n2005 to 2007. He has a stable work record since the crime. AG \u00b6 32(a) is not applicable \nbecause the crimes continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment, but there is evidence of rehabilitation, warranting the application of AG \u00b6 \n32(d).  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n\n \n7 \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s crimes support a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct created a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable for the same rationale discussed under the Criminal \nConduct analysis. Applicant submitted evidence of rehabilitation and remorse. However, \nthe criminal acts occurred over an extended period. I cannot make an affirmative finding \nthat the behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) is partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nactions are common knowledge, which has lessened his vulnerability to coercion, \nexploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that Personal Conduct concerns are still present despite the \npresence of some mitigation.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n8 \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy was filed about nine years ago, and his debts were \ndischarged seven years ago. Those events, standing alone, are not recent enough to \nconstitute a security concern. AG \u00b6 20(a) is applicable to his bankruptcy. He accrued \nadditional delinquent debts after the bankruptcy and still owes two debts amounting to \nmore than $10,000. His financial issues are current and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable to his recent financial problems.  \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant attributed the financial problems that led to his bankruptcy to his first \nwife and his divorce. These events qualify as conditions that were outside his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant started stealing from his company before, or shortly after, his debts were \ndischarged in bankruptcy. That is completely irresponsible conduct. His more recent \ndebts resulted from a conscious decision to stop paying his debts while his wife was in \nschool. That does not constitute an event that was outside his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \npartially applicable to his bankruptcy. It is not applicable to his recent financial problems.  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He paid or settled about $2,390 \nworth of debts, but he still has more than $10,000 in debts to address. His efforts at \npaying his delinquent debts are not yet sufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort to pay \nor resolve his debts. He has not established clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not applicable.  \n \nApplicant established that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was discharged in his \nbankruptcy. He denied owing the $420 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k. That debt \nwas listed on a May 2009 credit report, but not on a more recent credit report. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is applicable to those two debts. \n \n \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances remain a concern despite the presence of \nsome mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n\n \n10 \n \nApplicant appeared remorseful and embarrassed about his crimes. There is no \nevidence of other criminal activities. However, this was not a spur of the moment action. \nHis crimes took place repeatedly over three or more months. The thefts occurred \naround the same time as his bankruptcy. He again has financial problems that are \nunresolved.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Criminal Conduct security concerns, but he has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct and Financial Considerations concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.e-2.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.j-2.k: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.
