Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA, Item 4) on\nSeptember 5, 2008. He provided an interview to an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) on October 10, 2008. The interview appears in his\nAnswers to Interrogatories, dated March 10, 2009 (Item 5). On May 19, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing security concerns under foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence\n(Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\nNovember 25, 2009\n\n2\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on June 11, 2009. He requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on July 16, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on July\n28, 2009. His response was due on August 28, 2009. No response was received. The\ncase file was assigned to me on October 6, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges six allegations under foreign preference (Guideline C), and five\nallegations under foreign influence (Guideline B). Applicant essentially admitted all\nallegations with minor explanation. Applicant married his 26-year-old wife in April 2008.\nShe entered the U.S. in that month on a fiance visa and has applied for a resident visa.\nApplicant seeks his first security clearance. \nForeign Preference\nApplicant was born in the U.S. in January 1982 to Yemeni parents. This 27-year-\nold has worked as a software engineer II for a defense contractor since June 2008. \nApplicant exercises dual citizenship with Yemen and the U.S. (SOR 1.a, Item 4).\nOn March 10, 2009, Applicant possessed a Yemeni passport that was issued in March\n2008, and scheduled to expire in 2014. He admitted that he renewed his Yemeni\npassport as requirement to maintain Yemeni citizenship (SOR 1.b, Item 6). Applicant\nwas issued a Yemeni passport in March 2008 even though he is a U.S. citizen by\nreason of birth, and he had a valid U.S. passport issued on October 2, 2002 (SOR 1.c,\nItem 5). He uses his Yemeni passport instead of his U.S. passport to enter and exit\nYemen (SOR 1.d, Item 3, 6). He used his Yemeni passport to enter and exit Egypt in\nMarch 2008 (SOR 1.e, item 3, 6). Applicant does not want to relinquish his Yemeni\ncitizenship, and maintains his Yemeni passport to travel to the country and to prevent\nretaliation by the Government of Yemen against his family (SOR 1.f, Item 3, 5).\nRegarding the risk of retaliation, Applicant stated, \u201cFurthermore, Due to the political\nclimate, I might not be allowed to enter Yemen and there might be government\nretaliation against me, my wife and our families\u201d (Item 5).\nForeign Influence\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is 26 years old and a citizen of Yemen residing in the U.S.\n(SOR 2.a, Item 3). She is a homemaker and part-time student at a local college. She\nreceived medical technician training from a college in Yemen (Item 5 at 2). She was\nexpecting a child in September 2009 (Id.). \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s mother, 57 years old, is a citizen of Yemen residing in the U.S. and\nYemen (SOR 2.b). She is a homemaker, having retired as a flight attendant manager for\nYemenia Airlines (Item 5 at 2).\nApplicant\u2019s father, 60 years old, is a citizen of Yemen residing mostly in Yemen\nand partially in the U.S. (SOR 2.c). He is a commercial airline pilot for Yemenia Airlines\n(Item 5 at 2). \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a resident citizen of Yemen (SOR 2.d). She is a 22-year-old\ncollege student at the University of Lebanon (Item 5 at 2). \nApplicant\u2019s father-in\u2013law is a citizen of Yemen residing in the country (SOR 2.f).\nHe is a physician at a hospital. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born and continues to live\nin Yemen as a homemaker (Item 5 at 2). \nUnder SOR 2.g, Applicant has made six trips to Yemen since 1999 (Id.). The last\ntrip was from October 2007 to April 2008, not February 2008 as alleged (Item 3).\nApplicant has weekly contact with his family and visits them every two years\n(Item 5 at 3). Applicant\u2019s wife has weekly contact with their families (Id.). \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted no evidence concerning his job performance. \nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in the administrative notice\ndocuments provided by the government. The administrative notice documents are:\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Background Note; Yemen,\ndated December 2007, (10 pages);\nU.S. Department of State, Yemen Country Specific Information, dated April 22, 2009 (6\npages);\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Travel Warning-Yemen, dated\nJune 26, 2009 (2 pages);\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Yemen\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2008, dated February 25, 2009 (30\npages);\nU.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Counter Terrorism, Country\nReports on Terrorism, Chapter 2 - Country Reports; Middle East and North Africa\nOverview (\u201cYemen\u201d at pages 23-25), dated April 30, 2009 (25 pages);\n\n4\nCongressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress, Yemen: Current\nConditions and U.S. Relations, dated September 12, 2007 (12 pages).\nAfter reviewing the administrative source documents, I take administrative notice\nof the following facts concerning the country of Yemen:\nThe Republic of Yemen was formed in 1990. The country is an important partner\nof the U.S. in the war on terrorism. However, terrorist organizations and related\norganizations are believed to have active operations in the eastern part of the country\nand the Arab Peninsula, and are engaged in extremist activities against U.S. citizens\nand interests. Yemen has a poor human rights record with governmental agencies\nengaging in human rights violations including arbitrary arrests, detentions without\ncharges, and torture. The failure of Yemen to not always recognize the U.S. citizenship\nof dual citizens of Yemen and the U.S. hampers efforts by the U.S. consulate to provide\naid to those individuals. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nand are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nIn reaching a decision under the Directive, the administrative judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision. The administrative judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision that incorporates a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration in every\ndecision. AG \u00b6 2(b) recommends that any reasonable doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information should be resolved in favor of national\nsecurity. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I\nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference\nAG \u00b6 9 sets forth the security concern related to foreign preference:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.\nAG \u00b6 10 lists two conditions that may be disqualifying. They are:\nAG \u00b6 10(a) (exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship\nof a family member). This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or\nother such benefits from a foreign country;\n(b) (action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen). \nApplicant is a dual citizen by virtue of his birth in the U.S. and his parents\u2019 birth in\nYemen. After becoming a U.S. citizen through birth in 1982, and receiving his U.S.\npassport on October 3, 2002, he applied for and was granted a Yemeni passport in\nMarch 2008. The Yemeni passport is scheduled to expire in March 2014. By using his\nYemeni passport on at least four occasions to enter an exit Yemen, he took advantage\nof a privilege of Yemeni citizenship he was not entitled to as a U.S citizen. Both AG\nconditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 11 has two conditions that are potentially applicable:\nAG \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship); \nAG \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated). \nApplicant has essentially stated that he does not want to renounce his citizenship\nbecause he is concerned about some kind of retaliation being taken by the Government\nof Yemen against his family. AG \u00b6 11(b) does not apply. Applicant appears to have no\nintention of relinquishing his Yemeni passport as it allows him to enter and exit Yemen\nto see his family without a problem. AG \u00b6 11(e) is inapplicable. The foreign preference\nguideline is resolved against Applicant. \n\n6\nForeign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern of the foreign influence guideline:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 has two conditions that create security concerns that are applicable:\nAG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion);  \nAG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that status creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).\nApplicant has close and continuing family ties as demonstrated by his immediate\nfamily members who are citizens and at least part-time residents of Yemen. Applicant\u2019s\nparents are citizens of Yemen residing part of the year in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s sister and\nparents-in-law are also citizens and residents of Yemen. The strength of Applicants\nfamily ties is demonstrated by his six trips to the country since 1999. In sum, Applicant\u2019s\nfamily members are citizens and residents of Yemen, a country with diplomatic relations\nwith the U.S., but also a country with a poor human rights record, and a location where\ninternationally recognized terrorist organizations are believed to target U.S. citizens and\ninterests. There is sufficient evidence under AG \u00b6 7(a) to establish a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation. Applicant\u2019s wife (a Yemeni citizen) adds to the heightened risk of\ninfluence because she has been sharing living quarters with him since April 2008. AG \u00b6\n7(d) also applies. \nThe burden then switches to Applicant to adduce sufficient evidence under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), that he is unlikely to be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween his relatives in Yemen and U.S. interests. AG \u00b6 8(a) indicates:\n(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\n\n7\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.); \nAG \u00b6 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long-lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\nAG \u00b6 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation)\nWith regard to AG \u00b6 8(a), Applicant\u2019s mother is retired from the airline business.\nHowever, there is no way to tell whether the airlines is a government enterprise or is a\nprivate entity. The record does not reveal whether she receives a pension from the\nYemeni airline or any other information to explain how she supports herself presently.\nThe same question arises concerning the current employment of Applicant\u2019s father as a\npilot of the same airline. There is no indication whether the airline is a government\nbusiness or private business. Though Applicant provided information that his father-in-\nlaw is a physician, there is no information whether he is in private practice or works for\nthe government. Applicant also provided information that his mother-in-law is a\nhomemaker. The record is silent on whether she has always been a homemaker or is\nretired from a profession. The lack of detail about Appellant\u2019s immediate family\nmembers, their occupations/activities/lifestyle, and his genuine concern about retaliation\nagainst members of his family by the Government of Yemen, renders AG 8(a)\ninapplicable. \nApplicant\u2019s close contacts with his immediate family members is not minimal, and\nhe has provided scant evidence showing his relationships in the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b) does\nnot apply.\nThe presumption that applies to AG \u00b6 8(c) is that contact with immediate family\nmembers is neither casual nor infrequent. Considering his weekly contact and physical\ncontact every two years with his immediate family (resident citizens of Yemen) is neither\ncasual nor infrequent, Applicant has not established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(c). Judging\nthe entire record in its totality, the foreign influence guideline is resolved against\nApplicant. \nWhole Person Concept \nMy finding against Applicant under foreign preference and foreign influence\nguidelines must still be evaluated in the context of nine variables known as the whole\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors at \u00b6 2.(a) of the AG: \n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant was 26 years old when he declared his dual citizenship status in his\nSeptember 2008 security form (Item 4), and indicated he wanted to maintain that status\nin March 2009 (Item 5). He took unequivocal action to sustain his dual status when he\napplied for and received a Yemeni passport in March 2008, 26 years after he was born\nin the U.S., and more than five years after he received his U.S. passport. He admitted\nhe renewed his foreign passport to preserve his Yemeni citizenship. Applicant intends to\ncontinue using his Yemeni passport when entering and exiting the country because he\nbelieves the Government of Yemen may retaliate against his family if he renounces his\ncitizenship or destroys his passport. Applicant\u2019s decision not to surrender his foreign\npassport and his frequent and close contact with his immediate family members,\nresident citizens of Yemen, has not been mitigated. Accordingly, the foreign preference\nand foreign influence guidelines are found against him.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f. \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On July 9, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on July 15, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non August 24, 2009. I received the case assignment on August 25, 2009.  DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on September 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nOctober 13, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which\n\n2\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted\nApplicant Exhibit A, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nOctober 21, 2009. The record closed on October 21, 2009. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 52, and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant used marijuana 20 times during the period 1977 and approximately\nSeptember 2008. According to the Applicant, his use of marijuana was very infrequent.\nThe last time the Applicant used drugs was September 2008, with some work friends at\nhis house. (Transcript at 21-25.)

(See Government Exhibits 2 and 3.)\nApplicant stated that he would not use marijuana in the future because he needs\na security clearance for his job. He was asked whether, if he did not need a clearance,\nhe would continue to use marijuana in the future. He replied, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t need a Security\nClearance, I might consider it.\u201d (Transcript at 33.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected employee. He has been working in the defense industry, though in positions\nnot needing a security clearance, since 1984. He has been promoted steadily during\nthat time. His \u201cIntegrated Performance Assessment\u201d ratings from his employer for the\nyears 2006, 2007, and 2008, are \u201ceffective\u201d or \u201chighly effective.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially\nconsidered the following:  \n(a) any drug abuse; and\n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \nThe Applicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis, from 1977 until\napproximately September 2008. While he stated an intent not to use drugs in the future\nbecause he needed a security clearance, his statement was not clear and convincing. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 and especially\nconsidered the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period\nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. \nThe evidence is clear that the Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana were the actions of a\nmature person. As of the date of the hearing, the Applicant was 52 and had been using\nmarijuana, albeit infrequently, for 30 years. If his job did not require him to have a\n\n5\nsecurity clearance, it is likely that he would continue such use into the future. He is\ncommended for being honest with the Defense Department about his drug use, when\nothers recommended he lie. However, insufficient time has passed to show that he truly\nintends to stop marijuana use. The Applicant did not provide a signed statement that he\nwould not use marijuana in the future with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional who has engaged in occasional marijuana use for many years.\nIn viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity significance of his prior conduct. As set forth above, I find that there have not\nbeen permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). In addition, I find that there is\nstill potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there\nis likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug\ninvolvement as expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old, and has been a claims analyst for a defense contractor for over three years. She is married with an adult son and an adult step-son, both living independently of Applicant and her husband (Tr. 17-18; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated June 9, 2007). Applicant worked for 26 years for a manufacturer. The plant closed in April 2005, and Applicant lost her job. In 2004, her last full year of employment, her pay was $51,555. After being laid-off, Applicant was unemployed for three months before she found temporary employment with another manufacturer for seven months. Her pay for 2005 (including from the first employer, her severance package, and from the second employer) was $62,606. After the temporary employment ended, Applicant and her husband moved to another part of the state for better employment opportunities. Applicant was unemployed for one month before she started working for the defense contractor in March 2006. Her monthly salary is now about $1,050. Her husband has been unable to find steady work as an electrician. On a good month, he only contributes about $500 to the family income. Their combined monthly income is approximately $1,550.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on June \n9, 2007, as part of her employment with a defense contractor. On May 5, 2009, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial considerations under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended \n(Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August \n7, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2009. She admitted 15 and \ndenied 5 allegations under Guideline F. She requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 28, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on September 4, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing on October 8, 2009, for a hearing on October 21, 2009. Applicant signed for \n1 \n \nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n2 \n \nthe Notice of Hearing on October 13, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \ngovernment offered five exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant submitted three exhibits, marked \nApplicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through C, which were received without objection. \nApplicant and one witness testified on her behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on November 5, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on October 13, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8.). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of October 21, 2009, prior to the Notice of \nHearing being mailed, so actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the \nhearing. However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only eight days prior to the \nhearing. If there was an issue on notice, Applicant waived the 15 days notice \nrequirement (Tr. 4-6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted five and denied 15 of the 20 allegations under Guideline F in \nthe SOR. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old, and has been a claims analyst for a defense contractor \nfor over three years. She is married with an adult son and an adult step-son, both living \nindependently of Applicant and her husband (Tr. 17-18; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for \nPublic Trust Position, dated June 9, 2007).  \n \n \nApplicant worked for 26 years for a manufacturer. The plant closed in April 2005, \nand Applicant lost her job. In 2004, her last full year of employment, her pay was \n$51,555. After being laid-off, Applicant was unemployed for three months before she \nfound temporary employment with another manufacturer for seven months. Her pay for \n2005 (including from the first employer, her severance package, and from the second \nemployer) was $62,606. After the temporary employment ended, Applicant and her \nhusband moved to another part of the state for better employment opportunities. \nApplicant was unemployed for one month before she started working for the defense \ncontractor in March 2006. Her monthly salary is now about $1,050. Her husband has \nbeen unable to find steady work as an electrician. On a good month, he only contributes \nabout $500 to the family income. Their combined monthly income is approximately \n$1,550. Their monthly expenses are the same as their income, $1,550. Applicant and \nher husband admit that they financially live month-to-month. Applicant also takes a large \nnumber of medications, which account for some of her normal current expenses (Tr. 17-\n21, 36-37; App. Ex. A, Social Security earnings record, dated July 8, 2008; App. Ex. B, \nMedical Expenses, date October 19, 2009).  \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant has been a productive worker for the defense contractor. The normal \ngoal for her unit is 100% to 110% of target. Applicant has averaged a productivity \npercentage of 197% of the goal since she has worked for the defense contractor (App. \nEx. C, Productivity report, dated November 2009). \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, dated April 15, 2009; Gov. Ex. 4, dated December 23, \n2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated September 11, 2007) listed 20 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $17,824 for Applicant. The debts include the following 15 \ncollection accounts: $69 on a medical account (SOR 1.a); $9,246 on a car repossession \n(SOR 1.b); $111 on a utility account (SOR 1.c); $328 on a telephone account (SOR \n1.d); $1,178 for apartment rent (SOR 1.e); $147 on a medical account (SOR 1.f); $45 \nfor a returned check (SOR 1.g); $880 for a credit card account (SOR 1.h); $1,138 for a \ncredit card account ( SOR 1.k); $636 for another telephone account (SOR 1.l); $1,503 \nfor another utility account (SOR 1.m); $815 for a credit card account (SOR 1.q); $140 \nfor a television service account (SOR 1.r); and $80 (SOR 1.s) and $57 (SOR 1.t) for two \ncomputer service accounts for the same creditor. Also listed are five charged-off \naccounts including: $105 for a mail catalog company (SOR 1.i); $271 for a clothing store \n(SOR 1.j); $126 on a telephone account (SOR 1.n); and $294 (SOR 1.o), and $655 \n(SOR 1.p) for unknown accounts for the same creditor. \n   \n \nAll of the debts, except one, became delinquent after Applicant was laid off from \nher original job with the manufacturer in April 2005. The one debt that arose before the \nlay off was for apartment rent listed at SOR 1.e. While Applicant admitted the debt in \nresponse to the SOR, she disputed the debt at the hearing. She was charged for a \nmonth's rent when she vacated the apartment. She claims she vacated the apartment at \nthe end of the lease and should not have been charged with another month's rent. In \nher previous discussions with the landlord, there was no agreement so she has not \nbeen in contact with them in recent years (Tr. 32-35).  \n \n \nThe largest debt for $9,246 at SOR 1.b is for the remainder after a car \nrepossession. Before Applicant was laid off, she and her husband purchased two cars \nin 2004. After she was laid off, they could not continue to make two car payments. She \nfinished paying for one, and the other car was repossessed, causing the debt at SOR \n1.b (Tr. 32-34).  \n \n \nShe admitted 15 of the debts but denied five. She denied the medical debt of \n$147 at SOR 1.f because she did not have information on the account. She has not \ncontacted any creditor or the credit reporting agencies to get information on the \naccount. She denied the $880 credit card debt at SOR 1.h. She admitted she had a \ncredit card with the creditor and had no reason to question the validity of the account. \nShe initially denied the $105 account to a catalog store at SOR 1.i. After learning that \nshe made a purchase from the company, Applicant noted the item she purchased was \nplaced in storage when she moved. The item was sold when she could not pay the \nstorage fee. Applicant denied purchasing an item for $271 from the store or catalog of \nthe creditor list at SOR 1.j. Applicant denied that she had a credit card with the creditor \nlisted for the debt of $1,503 at SOR 1.m. Applicant has not contacted any of the \ncreditors listed for debts in the SOR because she is unable to pay any of the debts. She \n\n4 \n \nhas no funds left after paying her living expenses to make any payments to the creditors \n(Tr. 24-31).   \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all \navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \n\"assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d Trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA \nby the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management (See, The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004). Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded \nthe right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \naccess determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust or a sensitive position, \nthe administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. The entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision (AG \u00b6 2(c)). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a public trust concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, as established by credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant has approximately 20 delinquent debts from medical bills, credit cards, utility \nand telephone service and car repossession that became delinquent after Applicant lost \nher long term job. Because the debts became delinquent as early as 2005, she has a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. Since she now lives from paycheck-to-\npaycheck, she has an inability to satisfy her past debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). Both of these mitigating conditions apply to Applicant's \nfinancial problems. The debts, except one, became delinquent because the plant where \nApplicant worked for many years closed, and she lost her good paying job. After the lay-\noff, she was unable to meet her financial obligations. She did seek work, and was only \nunemployed for a few months. She and her husband even moved to find employment. \nShe is now working for a defense contractor, but her salary is less than a third of her \npast salary. She is current with her present debts, and lives within the means of her \npresent income. However, she has no funds to make payments on her past obligations. \nApplicant's financial problems were caused by conditions beyond her control. She acted \nresponsibly by aggressively seeking employment, although at a lower pay, and not \n\n6 \n \nincurring any additional financial obligations. The conditions causing the loss of her \nemployment are unlikely to recur, and she acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nHer past-due debts do not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment under these circumstances,  \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control) and it does not apply. There is no indication Applicant \nreceived financial counseling.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) and it does not apply. For FC \nMC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, \nand \u201cevidence\u201d of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is \nneeded. Applicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \n\"meaningful track record\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual \ndebt payments or reduction of debt through payment of debts. The entirety of an \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation and her actions can reasonably be considered in \nevaluating the extent to which that Applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination. All that is required is that Applicant demonstrates she has established a \nplan to resolve her financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that \nplan. Applicant has no plan to resolve her past due financial obligations because she \ndoes not have the ability to repay the debts. She lost her lucrative employment through \nno fault of her own, and out of necessity took a job paying a third of her former salary. \nThis new position provided only sufficient funds to meet her present financial \nobligations, and no funds to pay past-due debts. She and her husband live paycheck-to-\npaycheck and do not have the ability to pay past obligations.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve he issue) and it applies in part. Applicant disputes the one debt for an \napartment rent that preceded her loss of employment. While she contests the charge, \nshe has taken no action since initially being rebuffed by the landlord to resolve the issue \nbecause of her feeling that the landlord was not reasonable in resolving the dispute. \nShe has no documentation to show she made any attempts initially to resolve the \ndispute with the landlord.  \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly towards her debts caused by conditions beyond \nher control. Applicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns \nfor financial considerations because she took aggressive and reasonable action to find \nemployment after being laid-off, and controlled her future spending. Her finances do not \nindicate a public trust concern.   \n \n \n\n7 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant lost a well-\npaying job after many years because of conditions beyond her control when the plant \nshe worked at for over 26 years closed. I considered she aggressively sought \nemployment and was only unemployed for a total of four months after losing her job. \nShe and her husband did not sit still, but moved to find better employment opportunities. \nShe is now underemployed based on her new salary. Applicant's financial problems \nstem from her unemployment followed by underemployment. She is a good worker in \nher new position with a productivity rating almost twice what is required.  \n \n \nApplicant is paying her present obligations and living within the means of her new \nlower salary level. However, she has not been able to establish a meaningful track \nrecord of debt payment of past debts. Her inability to establish such a meaningful track \nrecord is because of a loss of employment because of conditions beyond her control \nand her continued underemployment. Because of her actions in aggressively finding \nemployment and living within her new salary, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \narising from her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.t: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire on August 28, 2008. On \nJuly 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 15, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 21, 2009. The case was assigned to me on September 28, 2009. On \nOctober 1, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for October 21, \n2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 - 4, which were admitted without objection. The government requested \nthat administrative notice be taken of eight documents with one document being a \nmemorandum which summarizes key points in the administrative notice documents. \nNovember 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe documents were marked as Administrative Notice Document (Admin Not) I - VIII \nwithout objection. The memorandum is Admin Not VIII. Applicant testified and submitted  \nfour exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D without objection.  \nDOHA received the transcript of hearing on October 29, 2009. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nThe following information is from the administrative notice documents: \n \nNigeria is a federal republic located in western Africa. Since gaining \nindependence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria has faced intermittent political turmoil and \neconomic crisis. Nigerian political life has been scarred by conflict along both ethnic and \ngeographic lines and dominated by military coups and long military-imposed transition \nprograms rather than civilian rule. The military has ruled Nigeria for approximately 28 of \nits 47 years since independence. Nigeria transitioned to civilian governance in May \n1999. (Admin Not I; II)  \n \nSince the restoration of basic democracy in Nigeria in 1999, the bilateral \nrelationship with the United States has continued to improve, and cooperation of many \nimportant foreign policy goals, such as regional peacekeeping, has been excellent.  The \nNigerian government lent strong diplomatic support to U.S. Government anti-terrorism \nefforts in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Nigerian \ngovernment has both condemned terrorist attacks and supported military action against \nthe Taliban and Al Qaida. The Nigerian government plays a leading role in forging an \nanti-terrorism consensus among states in Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated one million \nNigerians and Nigerian-Americans live, study, and work in the U.S., while over 25,000 \nAmericans live and work in Nigeria. (Admin Not I at 12) Nigeria is one of the United \nStates\u2019 key strategic partners in Africa. The country is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, \nand is the United States\u2019 fifth largest oil provider. (Admin Not II,  Summary)  \n \nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country with over 250 ethnic groups and its \npeople suffer from pervasive poverty. Ethnic and religious clashes in parts of the \ncountry are common. Nigeria has pursued a policy of developing domestic military \nproduction capabilities. (Admin Not I; II) \n \nThe U.S. State Department issued a travel warning recommending that United \nStates citizens avoid travel to the Niger Delta states of Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers \nbecause of continued risks of kidnapping, robbery, and other armed attacks in these \nareas. The Nigerian government considers militant camps and surrounding areas in the \nDelta region states of Delta, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, and Rivers to be conflict areas. \nTravel by foreigners to these areas without prior consultation and coordination with local \nsecurity authorities is not recommended, as the Nigerian Government may see this \nactivity as inappropriate and potentially illegal. (Admin Not V)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe Nigerian Government\u2019s human rights record is poor, and the government \ncontinues to commit serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and \nimpunity of abuses by security forces, torture, arbitrary arrest, and judicial corruption. \nNigerian police and other law enforcement officials do not always inform the U.S. \nEmbassy of Consulate immediately of the arrest or detention of a U.S. citizen. (Admin \nNot III; IV)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 15, 2009, Applicant admits to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old systems administrator and information technology (IT) \nsecurity manager employed with a Department of Defense contractor. He has worked \nfor the same employer since June 2007. He became a security manager in October \n2007. This is his first time applying for a Department of Defense security clearance. In \nJune 2003, he applied for a clearance with the State Department. The clearance was \ndenied because of financial and other issues. He has a bachelor of science degree in \nphysical science/aerospace engineering. He is twice divorced and has four sons, ages \n30, 26, 18 and 14. (Tr at 6-7, 56-58, 64-66; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Nigeria. He attended elementary and high \nschool in Nigeria. He also took some college courses at a Nigerian University.  In 1982, \nhe moved to the U.S. as a university student. He became a U.S. citizen on September \n9, 1993 and received a U.S. passport on November 17, 1993. His Nigerian passport \nexpired on February 27, 2005. Applicant provided a sworn affidavit that he never \nintends to renew his Nigerian passport in the future and he intends to renounce his \nNigerian citizenship. (Tr at 16-19, 28, 55-56; AE D) \n \n He married his first wife in September 1987. She was a U.S. citizen. One son \nwas born of the marriage in April 1990. They divorced in January 1993. He married his \nsecond wife in March 1995. She was a Nigerian citizen who he met in the U.S. One son \nwas born of the marriage in May 1995. They divorced in March 2005. (Gov 1, Section \n13; Gov 4)   \n \nHis two oldest sons were born out of wedlock in Nigeria in 1979 and in February \n1983. His oldest son was born in Nigeria but is a naturalized United States citizen. His \nsecond oldest son is a Nigerian citizen. (Tr at 47, 66; Gov 1, section 15; see also Gov 4) \nHe moved to the United States when he was 16 to attend high school. He encountered \nlegal problems and developed some mental health issues. Applicant was unable to care \nfor him because of his work schedule and sent him to live with his brother in Nigeria. His \nsecond oldest son still resides in Nigeria. He earned a two year degree in computer \nscience but is currently unemployed.  (Tr at 47-49, 66-67) Applicant\u2019s other three sons \nare United States citizens. He has custody of his youngest son, age 14.  He attends \nboarding school in New England. His oldest son lives with him and works at a \nrestaurant. He has had no contact with his 18-year-old son. (Tr at 59, 63-66; Gov 4)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 78-years-old. She is a permanent United States resident \nand lives with Applicant when she is in the United States. She has been a permanent \nU.S. resident for 13 years. Every two or three years she travels to Nigeria and lives \nthere for several months visiting family members. She cannot read or write in any \nlanguage and does not speak English so she gets bored in the United States. She has \nbeen in Nigeria since August 2009 and is likely to return to the United States in \nDecember 2009. Applicant supports his mother when she is living with him in the United \nStates and sends her money when she travels to Nigeria. (Tr at 29-30, 33, 41-43)  \n \nApplicant has three sisters and one brother who are citizens of and reside in \nNigeria. He contacts them on average of once a month. His brother is a self-employed \nmechanic. He also buys and sells cars in Nigeria. Applicant speaks with him over the \ntelephone at least once a month. One sister is a homemaker. Her husband is a property \nmanager. He contacts this sister once a week. Another sister is a homemaker. Her \nhusband works in the transportation field.  He contacts her about once a month. One \nsister worked for the Federal Inland Revenue Service as an auditor. The Federal Inland \nRevenue Service is the equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. \nShe was laid off a few years ago without receiving her retirement. Her husband was \nemployed as an auditor with the Nigerian Airport Authority. He was fired after he refused \nto take a bribe. (Tr at 30; Gov 2 at 3, 9; Gov 4) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified he is in contact with his siblings more \nwhen his mother lives with him because they call her more often. (Tr at 50-52) None of \nhis siblings currently work for the Nigerian government or receive pensions from the \nNigerian government. (Tr at 53) Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant has a \nbrother and sister who are Nigerian citizens, residing in the United Kingdom. His brother \nis a security guard. His sister is a nurse. (Gov 2 at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle is the king of the Irolu-Remo Ogun state in Nigeria. Applicant \nsays his uncle is the king of the village where he was born, a village of about 3000 \npeople. His position is ceremonial as opposed to governmental. Applicant states he is \nwealthy. He owns 20 -30 rental properties. Applicant\u2019s last contact with his uncle was in \n2000. He does not communicate with his uncle because he believes that his uncle and \nhis other uncles  treat his mother poorly. While growing up, she was not allowed to get \nan education and had to wait on her brothers. They do not take care of her. (Tr at 38, \n44, 62-64) \n \nDuring his divorce proceedings from his second wife in 2003, Applicant stated \nthat he was a crown prince born into a royal family in Nigeria, apparently to gain some \nsort of leverage in a hotly contested divorce. He testified during the hearing that he does \nnot have a royal title. Representing himself as a crown prince during the divorce \nproceedings was a mistake and did not get him anywhere in the divorce proceedings. \nHe still has child support issues with his second wife. (Tr at 45-46; Gov 3; Gov 4)  \n \nApplicant states that the United States is his country and he intends to work, \nretire, and live the rest of his life here. (Tr at 32) The last time he traveled to Nigeria was \n\n \n5 \n \n \nin 2001. He does not intend to travel to Nigeria in the future now that his mother lives \nwith him. (Tr at 54-56) \n \nApplicant\u2019s division chief notes Applicant was hired in June 2007, as a senior \nsystem administrator. Applicant\u2019s stellar performance resulted in an appointment as the \nIT security manager. Applicant demonstrates a sound work ethic and zeal for his duties \nand responsibilities. He has lead his team to keep computer-related vulnerabilities to a \nminimum while allowing desktop computer services to be provisioned with the highest \npossible productivity for customers. His commitment to accountability, responsibility, \nethics, and integrity would make him an excellent addition to any organization. (AE A) \n \nThe technical operations manager has worked with Applicant for over two years. \nAs a senior systems administrator, Applicant has complete access to almost 4000 \ncomputer systems. During his tenure, Applicant has done nothing to call that trust into \nquestion. As the IT security manager, Applicant is aware of and responds to every \nvulnerability that affects the company computer systems. (AE B) \n \nAn information security architect for the company wrote a letter indicating that \nApplicant has worked in the cubicle next to him for the past two years. He states that \nApplicant always maintains a professional demeanor and is helpful to associates. He is \nconscientious when coordinating various information security activities for the \ncontractor.  He and Applicant have different jobs and responsibilities and have only \noccasional professional interaction. However, Applicant has been knowledgeable and \ncooperative in those professional experiences. Applicant demonstrates honesty and \nintegrity. (AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing \nthat information) \n \nApplicant\u2019s 26-year-old son, three sisters, and one brother are citizens and \nresidents of Nigeria. An additional concern is raised because Applicant\u2019s mother travels \nto Nigeria and stays there for extended periods of time. She is currently in Nigeria. \nApplicant telephones his family members at least once a month. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create a heightened risk for foreign influence and could potentially result in \nthe compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001) \n \nIn this case, FI DC \u00b6 7(a) and FI DC \u00b6 7(b) apply because Applicant has contacts \nwith and connections to his family members in Nigeria. Most of his siblings live in \nNigeria.  He has regular contact with his family members which creates a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.  However, \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his extended family members who are citizens of and reside in \nNigeria, including his uncle who is the current ruling king of Irolu-Remo Ogun region, \nare not nearly as strong. His uncle, though wealthy, holds a ceremonial position in the \nsmall village where Applicant grew up. Applicant has had no contact with this uncle \nsince 2000. On another note, the fact that Applicant\u2019s sister retired from the Nigerian \nInland Revenue Service is unlikely to create a potential for heightened risk for  \nApplicant. She was not in a high-level position to raise a higher concern. She does not \nreceive retirement benefits from the government.  \n \nThree of the six mitigating conditions under the Foreign Influence guideline (FI \nMC) may apply to the facts and circumstances of this case: \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of \nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.)  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual \nand infrequent that there is little likelihood it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation) \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) and FI MC \u00b6 8(c) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships \nwith his nuclear-family members in Nigeria are of sufficient magnitude or strength to \nnegate these two mitigating conditions.  There is at least a remote or slight possibility \nthat dangerous elements within Nigeria could attempt to use his family members to \ncoerce or pressure Applicant. \n  \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States support the conclusion that he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict in favor of the United States interest. Applicant moved to the United States \nin 1982. He earned his college degree at a U.S. university. He became a U.S. citizen in \nSeptember 1993. He has lived and worked in the United States for 27 years. He does \nnot possess a valid foreign passport. He intends to live and work in the United States for \nthe rest of his life. He has not traveled to Nigeria since 2001 \u2013 over eight years ago. \nThree of his children are U.S. citizens and reside in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s \nmother lives with him most of the time. His strongest ties are to the United States.   \n    \nApplicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States \noutweigh any potential for conflict because of Applicant\u2019s relationship to his immediate \nrelative who are citizens of and reside in Nigeria.  The Guideline B concern is mitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to Nigeria, a country that is an ally of the United States but has \nsignificant internal problems.  \n \nI considered that Applicant is highly regarded at his current place of employment. \nHe was promoted within four months of accepting the position. He has lived in the \nUnited States for over 27 of his 49 years. He became a U.S. citizen in 1993. He has not \nvisited Nigeria in over eight years.  Three of his four sons live and reside in the U.S.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s family members living in Nigeria raise a potential security threat due to \nthe very nature of familial relationships, Applicant\u2019s significant ties to the United States \nmitigate the security threat. His deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States strongly support the conclusion that Applicant would resolve any attempt \nto exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the United States.   \n \nGuideline B is a security concern that affects Applicants through no fault of their \nown. The current nature of the Nigerian government makes it a substantial burden to \nmitigate the concerns raised under foreign influence.  In Applicant\u2019s case, his significant \npersonal relationships and contacts within the United States outweigh the concerns \nraised by having relatives who are citizens of and reside in Nigeria. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Foreign Influence security concerns are mitigated. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRoderic G. Steakley, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 7, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 26, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge James F. Duffy\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant deliberately falsified an answer on his security clearance application was erroneous, and\nwhether the Judge also erred by concluding that Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns\nbrought on by his answer to the security clearance application.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant is 50 years old and has a\nbachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree.  He has worked in the defense industry for about 20 years and, for\nmost of that employment,  has held a security clearance without committing any security violations.\nApplicant worked for Company A from June 2003 to June 2005.  After resigning from that job, he\nbegan working for Company B in September 2005.  While working for Company B, he became the\nsubject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation, which involved his handling of\nwork-related materials while employed by Company A.  In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant\nrelated the following: (a) that the FBI visited him at his home in February 2006; (b) the FBI was\ninvestigating claims made by Company A that he had taken certain confidential, proprietary and\ntrade secret information upon resignation from Company A; (c) the same day, Applicant advised his\nmanager at Company B about what had happened with the FBI; (d) Applicant remembered being\nplaced on administrative leave at that time, and believes that he received a letter from Company B\nshortly thereafter indicating that Company B and he should \u201cgo our separate ways\u201d; (e) Applicant\nreceived this letter while the FBI investigation was ongoing; (f) he was eventually exonerated of any\nwrongdoing relating to the FBI investigation.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that Company B immediately placed him on\nadministrative leave for a couple of days after he notified the company of the FBI investigation.\nImmediately following the administrative leave, he was presented with an employment termination\nletter.  The termination letter, dated February 3, 2006 stated, \u201cWe appreciate your contributions and\nservice during the time you have spent with [Company B].  Confirming your discussion with [your\nsupervisor], your employment with the firm is being terminated due to lack of appropriate work\nmatching your skills and abilities.  We regret that we are unable to avoid this result.\u201d  An OPM ROI\nindicates that Applicant\u2019s employment with Company B was terminated because there was no\nbillable work and was not the result of any problems or issues related to Applicant.  Applicant\ntestified that before receiving the termination letter, his supervisor advised him the reason for his\ntermination was the same as that stated in the termination letter.  Applicant specifically stated that\nhe was never informed that he was being terminated because of the ongoing FBI investigation.  \n\n3\nApplicant signed a security clearance application on March 6, 2008.  Applicant listed his\nemployment with Company B in Section 11 (Your Employment Activities), and submitted the\nfollowing additional comments: \u201cI joined [Company B] in summer of 2005 to work on the GMD\n[ground missile defense] program.  I left this position by Apr 2006 for personal reasons.  My\ndeparture was by mutual agreement with the company.\u201d  In Section 22 (Your Employment Record),\nhe was asked whether any of the following had happened to him in the past 7 years: (1) fired from\na job; (2) quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired; (3) left a job by mutual agreement following\nallegations of misconduct; (4) left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory\nperformance; and (5) left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.  Applicant\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to that question and submitted the following additional comments: \u201cI left (resigned)\n[Company A] in 2005 to start work with [Company B].  I left [Company B] in 2006 (by mutual\nagreement) for personal reasons.  None of the above apply.\u201d  At the hearing, Applicant testified that\nhe responded \u201cno\u201d to Section 22 because none of the five situations in that question applied to him.\nSpecifically, he interpreted the word \u201cfired\u201d to have a negative connotation.  He did not believe he\nwas fired.  He also testified that, in retrospect, he should have indicated he was fired because he was\nterminated from his job.  He also stated that he did not leave his job with Company B for personal\nreasons or as a result of mutual agreement.  Applicant indicated his additional comments in Section\n11 were not stated well, and his additional comments in Section 22 about leaving Company B by\nmutual agreement for a personal reason was a misstatement.  \nOverall, Applicant is not a credible witness.  During his testimony, he was asked if he\nthought the termination of his employment with Company B was because the FBI was investigating\nhim.  It was pointed out to him that he was placed on administrative leave for a couple of days\nimmediately following his report of the investigation and was terminated immediately following the\nadministrative leave.  Nonetheless, he testified that he did not believe these events were connected.\nApplicant\u2019s claim is contradicted by statements he made in responding to interrogatories and in his\nAnswer to the SOR.    In responding to the interrogatories, he stated: \u201cI still believe (now 2010) that\nit was fundamentally unfair to terminate my employment while I volunteered all information and\nno one had any information at the time regarding the FBI investigation.\u201d  In his Answer, Applicant\nstated, \u201cIt is my understanding that [Company B] and I were simply going our separate ways based\non allegations which I believed to be at the time and which were ultimately proved to be baseless.\u201d\nSuch statements show that he believed there was a connection between the FBI investigation and\nhis termination.  The FBI eventually informed Applicant that there was no indication that he\nengaged in any impropriety.\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: For a finding of falsification to be sustainable,\nan applicant must have had a culpable state of mind at the time the information was submitted.  A\nfalsification must be made deliberately\u2013knowingly and willfully.  An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence that an applicant had a culpable state of mind at the time of the submission.  Based on the\ncircumstances surrounding his termination, Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the question in Section 22\nand its subparts was not unreasonable.  Applicant did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\nby checking the \u201cno\u201d block in Section 22.  However, in responding to section 22, Applicant did\nmore than check the \u201cno\u201d block.  He provided additional comments that were false and misleading.\n\n4\nHe did not leave his employment with Company B by mutual agreement or for personal reasons.\nWhen he made those additional comments, he knew that Company B terminated his employment\nand that he had no input in that decision.  He provided deliberate false statements in both Section\n22 and Section 11.  Sufficient circumstantial evidence exists to establish that Applicant believed\nCompany B terminated his employment, in whole or part, because the FBI was investigating whether\nhe took proprietary and trade secret information from a former employer.  Applicant\u2019s statements\nthat he did not believe there was a connection between his reporting of the FBI investigation and his\ntermination are not credible.  Throughout the security clearance adjudicative process, Applicant\ndenied that he falsified his security clearance application.  He has not accepted responsibility for his\nmisconduct.  None of the mitigating conditions apply to the security concerns arising under\nGuideline E.  Applicant has worked in the defense industry for about 20 years and held a security\nclearance for most of that time.  Nevertheless, his deliberate false statements are serious, recent, and\nnot mitigated.\n   Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were inappropriately based on speculation\nas opposed to appropriate circumstantial evidence and were not supported by the record.  He asserts\nthat the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant attempted to deliberately mislead\nwhen he provided answers related to his past employments on the security clearance application.\nApplicant states that the Judge erroneously believed, based on highly speculative, circumstantial\nevidence, that Applicant\u2019s termination from Company B was related to the FBI purportedly\ninvestigating him, and that this conclusion permeates the entire decision.  Regarding mitigation,\nApplicant argues that the great weight of the evidence established that he has not engaged in actions\nwhich ultimately should be determined to compromise his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.\nHe asserts that his life-long conduct weighs most heavily in favor of granting the security clearance,\nas the incident in question is the only time and matter concerning which he has ever been\nquestioned, and this does not involve an actual security breach or misconduct with regard to\nclassified information.  Applicant has failed to establish error on the part of the Judge.  After a\nreview of the entire record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant engaged in\ndeliberate falsification is sustainable. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less that the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nGiven the fact that Applicant denied willful falsification of his responses on his security\nclearance application, the Judge, by necessity, relied on circumstantial evidence to make findings\nof fact regarding Applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time he provided answers and explanations about\nhis prior employment.  There was sufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s finding and conclusion\nthat Applicant was not truthful.  Among the facts explicitly discussed and considered by the Judge,\n\n5\nwere: (a) the proximity in time between the point at which Applicant informed Company B of the\nFBI investigation and the placing of Applicant on administrative leave (a step the necessity of which\nis unclear if Applicant were being terminated for mere lack of work appropriate to Applicant\u2019s skills\nand abilities) and the ultimate termination of Applicant; (b) Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing that\nhis answers in Sections 11 and 22 of the application were \u201cmisstated,\u201d and that he should have\nindicated that he was fired; (c) Applicant\u2019s statement in response to interrogatories that when\ndescribing the FBI investigation and insisting that it had no basis to Company B, he felt he should\nbe believed, but Company B thought otherwise; (d) Applicant\u2019s statement in response to\ninterrogatories that Company B and he agreed to go their own ways, but he would not resign and\nwas therefore terminated; (e) Applicant\u2019s statement in response to interrogatories that he believed\nthat it was fundamentally unfair for Company B to terminate his employment when he had\nvolunteered all information concerning a pending FBI investigation; and (f) Applicant\u2019s statement\nin response to interrogatories that Company B should have let him continue to work normally\npending the outcome of the FBI investigation.  These facts provide a reasonable basis for the Judge\nto conclude that Applicant believed Company B terminated his employment because the FBI was\ninvestigating whether he mishandled proprietary information.  The facts also provide a reasonable\nbasis for the Judge to conclude that Applicant\u2019s later statement that he did not believe there was a\nconnection between his reporting of the FBI investigation, and his statement that he left Company\nB by mutual agreement for personal reasons were not credible.  These conclusions support the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the information Applicant provided on his security clearance\napplication was false and was the product of a deliberate intent to conceal.  Applicant\u2019s assertion\nthat the Judge engaged in improper speculation in reaching his findings and conclusions is without\nmerit.\nThe Judge based his findings and conclusions, in part, upon an unfavorable assessment of\nApplicant\u2019s credibility.  Given the inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s description of events that have\ndeveloped over time, the Judge\u2019s credibility determination is sustainable.\nApplicant also argues that the overall record demanded the favorable application of\nnumerous mitigating conditions.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  In this case, the Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He adequately discussed why\nthe disqualifying conduct established under Guideline E was not mitigated.  Notwithstanding\nApplicant\u2019s long and successful career and his unblemished track record regarding the handling of\nclassified information, the Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to accept\nresponsibility for his falsification misconduct perpetuates doubts about his trustworthiness and\nreliability and his current willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\n\n6\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Roderic G. Steakley, Esq. \n \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nDUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on March 6, 2008. On July 7, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \n \nOctober 26, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. On August 23, 2010, Applicant answered the \nSOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2011. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 24, 2011, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on September 14, 2011. At the hearing, the Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7. GE 1, 2, and 3 were admitted into evidence without objection. GE 5 \nwas admitted into evidence over Applicant\u2019s objection. I deferred ruling on Applicant\u2019s \nobjections to GE 4, 6, and 7 until issuance of this Decision. Applicant testified and \noffered exhibit (AE) A. Department Counsel objected to AE A and I deferred ruling on \nthat objection until issuance of this Decision. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non September 21, 2011.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nAs noted above, rulings on certain evidentiary objections were deferred until \nissuance of this Decision. Those rulings are as follows: \n \nGE 4. This is an email string that Applicant initiated. The names of the senders \nand recipients of the subsequent emails as well as other information have been \nredacted. In general, the subsequent emails address Applicant\u2019s work performance at \nCompany B. Applicant\u2019s Counsel objected to this exhibit essentially claiming it was \nhearsay and not relevant. He also indicated that its admission would be inappropriate \nbecause he did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the senders of the emails. \nThe objection to GE 4 is sustained. GE 4 is excluded from evidence based on lack of \nrelevance, hearsay, and \u00b6 E3.1.22 of the Directive.1 \n \n \nGE 6. This is an email string from employees of Company A discussing whether \nApplicant was resigning from his job. Applicant\u2019s Counsel objected to this document for \nthe same reasons he objected to GE 4. Department Counsel also indicated that it was \nbeing offered to show that Applicant was not candid during his resignation and for the \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 18-24. Applicant\u2019s email at the bottom of the email string is admissible as an admission, but \nit is not relevant to the issues in this case. The Appeal Board has held that \u00b6 E3.1.22 does not require \nexclusion of statements that are admissible under \u00b6 E3.1.20 or as exceptions to the hearsay rules under \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. See ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun 25, 2009) and ISCR \nCase No. 08-06997 (App. Bd. Mar 1, 2011). Emails between employees are not per se business records. \nSee Keneally, White Collar Crime: E-mails Sent During The Business Day May Not Be Admissible As \nBusiness Records, 28 Champion 42 (2004). \u201cThe business record exception to the proscription against \nhearsay set out in Rule 803(6) requires a showing that \u2018it was the regular practice of that business activity \nto make\u2019 the document proposed for admission into evidence, and that the document was \u2018kept in the \ncourse of a regularly conducted business activity.\u2019 Several courts have found that e-mails often do not \nmeet these tests.\u201d Id. at 42. See also Westfed Holdings, Inc. v. United States, 55 Fed. Cl. 544, 566, U.S. \nClaims LEXIS at *48 (Ct. of Fed. Claims 2003); New York v. Microsoft Corp, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, at *9 \n(D.D.C. April 12, 2002). In this case, it is unknown whether the emails in question were generated as a \nregular practice of the business. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwhole-person concept. The objection to GE 5 is sustained. GE 5 is excluded from \nevidence based on lack of relevance, hearsay, and \u00b6 E3.1.22 of the Directive.2 \n \n \nGE 7. This is an email string from employees of Company A discussing \nApplicant\u2019s resignation from that company. It also indicated that an investigation was \ninitiated into ZIP files found that apparently belonged to Applicant. Applicant\u2019s Counsel \nobjected to this exhibit for the same reasons he objected to GE 4. The objection to GE 7 \nis sustained. GE 7 is excluded from evidence based on hearsay and \u00b6 E3.1.22 of the \nDirective.3 \n \nAE A. This exhibit is two pages of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \nreport of investigation (ROI) into Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. It reflects that \nApplicant was involuntarily terminated from Company B due to no billable work \nmatching his skills and also indicates that no other documents pertaining to Applicant\u2019s \ntermination were located. Department Counsel objected to this exhibit based on \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 of the Directive. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20, an ROI may be received into evidence with \nan authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence. Nothing on the face of the ROI or in its contents suggest that it was not an \nofficial OPM investigative report or that it was prepared and maintained other than in the \nregular course of OPM business. In making his objection, Department Counsel basically \nconceded that this document was a ROI. Its authenticity is not an issue. Department \nCounsel\u2019s objection is overruled. AE A is admitted into evidence.4 \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take administrative \nnotice of which day of the week was September 12, 2005. The request was granted. \nSeptember 12, 2005, was a Monday.5 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s \nand a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from a major university and, except for \nthe dissertation, has completed the requirements for a doctorate degree. He has never \nbeen married and has no children. He has worked in the defense industry for about 20 \nyears and, for most of that employment, he has held a security clearance without \ncommitting any security violations. He testified that he was familiar with the security \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 26-32. See also note 1 above. \n3 Tr. 33-37.

See http//www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=2005. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclearance application process and was aware that prior employers are contacted during \nsecurity clearance investigations.6 \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts in responding to Section \n22 of his e-QIP. In his Answer, Applicant denied that allegation. \n \nApplicant worked for Company A from June 2003 to June 2005. In that job, he \nworked in a Special Access Program. After resigning from that job, he began working \nfor Company B in September 2005. While working for Company B, he became the \nsubject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation. In his Answer, he \nstated: \n \nIn February 2006 I had been employed by [Company B] for only a number \nof months. I received a visit at my home by representatives from the FBI \nwho were investigating claims made by a former employer [Company A] \nthat I had taken certain confidential, proprietary and trade secret \ninformation with me upon my resignation from that former employer. The \nsame work day after the visit from the FBI, I advised my manager at \n[Company B] that I had been visited by the FBI regarding allegations \nmade by a previous employer. I remember being placed on administrative \nleave at that time, and believe that I received a letter indicating that \n[Company B] and I should \u201cgo our separate ways\u201d shortly thereafter. I \nreceived this letter while the FBI investigation was ongoing. I was \neventually exonerated of any wrongdoing related to that investigation.7 \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that Company B immediately placed him on \nadministrative leave for a couple of days after he notified that company of the FBI \ninvestigation. He indicated his supervisor consulted with corporate counsel before he \nwas placed on administrative leave. Immediately following the administrative leave, he \nwas presented with an employment termination letter. He never returned to his job at \nCompany B after he notified that employer of the FBI investigation.8 \n \n \nThe termination letter from Company B is dated February 3, 2006. The first \nparagraph of the letter states: \n \nWe appreciate your contributions and service during the time you have \nspent with [Company B]. Confirming your discussion with [your \nsupervisor], your employment with the firm is being terminated due to lack \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 42; 44-47, 49, 51, 55-56, 60-63; GE 1, 2. \n7 Tr. 47-54, 73-86; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; GE 2, 5. \n8 Tr. 76-87, 100-102; GE 2, 3. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nof appropriate work matching your skills and abilities. We regret that we \nare unable to avoid this result.9 \n \nIn that letter, Applicant was informed that his last day of employment was February 17, \n2006. He was paid until the last day of his employment, but did not work during that two-\nweek period. He was required to surrender his building badge and allowed to obtain \npersonal items from his office. He did not recall if he was escorted to and from his office \nwhen he went to pick up his personal items. The OPM ROI indicates that Applicant\u2019s \nemployment with Company B was terminated because there was no billable work and \nwas not the result of any problems or issues related to Applicant.10  \n \nBefore receiving the termination letter, Applicant testified that his supervisor \nadvised him the reason for his termination was the same as that stated in the \ntermination letter, i.e., a lack of appropriate work matching his skills and ability. \nApplicant specifically stated that he was never informed that he was being terminated \nbecause of the ongoing FBI investigation. From April 2006 to March 2008, he was self-\nemployed doing part-time consulting work, but primarily lived off of his savings and \ninvestments.11 \n \nIn his e-QIP signed on March 6, 2008, Applicant listed his employment with \nCompany B in Section 11: Your Employment Activities and submitted the following \n\u201cAdditional Comments:\u201d \n \nI joined [Company B] in summer of 2005 to work on the GMD [ground \nmissile defense] program. I left this position by Apr 2006 for personal \nreasons. My departure was by mutual agreement with the company.12 \n \nIn Section 22: Your Employment Record of the e-QIP, he was asked the following \nquestion: \n \nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years? \n \n1. Fired from a job. \n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired. \n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct. \n4. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory \nperformance. \n5. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.13 \n                                                          \n9 Tr. 51-54; GE 3. \n10 Tr. 112-113; GE 3; AE A. \n11 Tr. 52-54, 67, 78, 90-91, 101-104; GE 1, 3. \n12 Tr. 57-60, 67, 85-87; GE 1. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to that question and submitted the following \u201cAdditional \nComments:\u201d \n \nI left (resigned) [Company A] in 2005 to start work with [Company B]. I left \n[Company B] in 2006 (by mutual agreement) for personal reasons. None \nof the above apply.14  \n \nIn signing the e-QIP, Applicant attested,  \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful statement on this form can be \npunished by fine or imprisonment or both (See section 1001 of title 18, \nUnited States Code).15 \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he responded \u201cNo\u201d to Section 22 because \nnone of the five situations in that question applied to him. Specifically, he interpreted the \nword \u201cfired\u201d to have a negative connotation. He indicated that he thought an employee \nhad to do something wrong or inappropriate to be fired. He did not believe he was fired. \nHe also testified that, in retrospect, he should have indicated that he was fired because \nhe was terminated from his job. He also stated that he did not leave his job with \nCompany B for personal reasons or as a result of a mutual agreement. He indicated his \n\u201cadditional comments\u201d in Section 11 were not stated well. He also indicated that his \n\u201cadditional comments\u201d in Section 22 about leaving Company B by mutual agreement for \npersonal reason was a misstatement.16 \n \nOverall, I found that Applicant was not a credible witness. During his testimony, \nhe was asked if he thought the termination of his employment with Company B was \nbecause the FBI was investigating him. In asking that question, it was first pointed out to \nhim that he was placed on administrative leave for a couple of days immediately \nfollowing his report of the investigation and was terminated immediately following the \nadministrative leave. Nonetheless, he testified that he did not believe these events were \nconnected. I did not find his testimony on that issue to be believable. Furthermore, \nApplicant\u2019s claim that he did not believe there was a connection between these events \nis also contradicted by statements he made in responding to interrogatories and in his \nAnswer to the SOR. In responding to the interrogatories, he stated: \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n13 Tr. 57-60, 85-90; GE 1. \n14 GE 1. \n15 Id. \n16 Tr. 52-53, 58-60, 85-90, 99-100; GE 3. In Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 3rd College Edition \n(1988), the word \u201cfire\u201d is defined as \u201cto dismiss from a position; discharge.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI still believe (now 2010) that it was fundamentally unfair to terminate my \nemployment while I volunteered all information and no one had any \ninformation at that time regarding the FBI investigation. \n \n*  *  * \n[Company B] should have let me continue to work normally pending the \noutcome of the FBI inspecting my computer system/media.17 \n \nIn his Answer, he stated, \u201cIt is my understanding that [Company B] and I were simply \ngoing our separate ways based on allegations which I believed to be at the time and \nwhich were ultimately proved to be baseless.\u201d Such statements show that he believed \nthere was a connection between the FBI investigation and his termination.18 \n \nApplicant testified that, in the summer of 2009, the FBI returned the property it \nseized from his house. At that time, the FBI also informed him there was no indication \nthat he engaged in any impropriety.19 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal from Company A in 2005 reflected that he \nreceived the grade of \u201cfar exceeds expectation\u201d in the category of \u201cAct with integrity in \nall we do.\u201d The comments provided in that section stated, \u201cHis integrity is a fundamental \ncharacteristic that is important in his life.\u201d In 2009, he received a performance evaluation \nfrom his current company that indicated he was performing at the \u201cexceptional\u201d or \n\u201cexceeds expectations\u201d levels.20  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \n                                                          \n17 GE 2 at I-13. \n18 Tr. 81-95, 101-104; GE 2, 3. Additionally, Applicant indicated in the interrogatories that \u201c. . . I \nwould not resign, therefore, I was terminated.\u201d When questioned about that comment at the hearing, he \nstated that Company B never asked him to resign. However, it does not make sense why he would make \nthat comment if he was never asked to resign. This is another inconsistency that raises questions about \nhis credibility. See Tr. 78-88, 100-101. \n19 Tr. 95-96; GE 2, 3. \n20 Tr. 63-66; GE 2. \n\n \n8 \n \n \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a \nclearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the \nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \na clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the concern is that conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15.) \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe Government has the burden of proving a controverted falsification allegation. \nEvidence that incorrect information was submitted on a security clearance application, \nstanding alone, does not prove a falsification. For a finding of falsification to be \nsustainable, an applicant must have had a culpable state of mind at the time the \ninformation was submitted. A falsification must be made deliberately -- knowingly and \nwillfully. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence that an applicant had a \nculpable state of mind at the time of the submission.21  \n \nIn February 2006, Company B informed Applicant that he was being terminated \ndue to lack of appropriate work matching his skills and abilities. There is no evidence in \nthe record that he was provided any other reason for that termination.  \n \n                                                          \n21 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. \nJune 9, 2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 12, 2007), ISCR Case No. 03-\n09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov 17, 2004). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant indicated that, when he was completing Section 22 of the e-QIP, he did \nnot believe any of the five situations set forth in that question applied to him. \nSpecifically, he believed he was not \u201cfired\u201d because his termination was not based on \nany wrongdoing or misconduct on his part. Essentially, Company B informed him that \nhe was being laid off. Based on the circumstances surrounding his termination, \nApplicant\u2019s interpretation of the question in Section 22 and its subparts was not \nunreasonable. Given the expressed reason provided by Company B for his termination, \nhe could have answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question in Section 22 without falsifying that \napplication. He did not need to speculate about the employer\u2019s motive for terminating \nhis employment. I find that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his e-QIP by checking \nthe \u201cNo\u201d block in Section 22. \n \n \nHowever, in responding to Section 22, Applicant did more than check the \u201cNo\u201d \nblock. He provided \u201cadditional comments\u201d that he \u201cleft [Company B] in 2006 (by mutual \nagreement) for personal reasons.\u201d Those additional comments were false and \nmisleading. He did not leave his employment with Company B by mutual agreement or \nfor personal reasons. When he made those \u201cadditional comments,\u201d he knew that \nCompany B terminated his employment and that he had no input in that decision. He \nprovided those false statements in both Section 22 and Section 11. I find that he \ndeliberately made those false statements. \n \n \nSufficient circumstantial evidence exists to establish that Applicant believed \nCompany B terminated his employment, in whole or in part, because the FBI was \ninvestigating whether he took proprietary and trade secret information from a former \nemployer. Immediately following his report to Company B of the FBI investigation, he \nwas placed on administrative leave for a couple of days and immediately thereafter was \nterminated. He never returned to work at Company B after informing it of the FBI \ninvestigation. I did not find credible Applicant\u2019s statements that he did not believe there \nwas a connection between his reporting of the FBI investigation and his termination. \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in March 2008, the FBI investigation against \nhim was still ongoing. At that time, he knew that his previous employment was \nterminated almost immediately after reporting that he was being investigated by the FBI \nfor allegedly taking proprietary information and trade secret from a former employer. To \navoid a similar recurrence, he provided false and misleading statements in the e-QIP \nabout the circumstances surrounding his departure from Company B. These false \nstatements were \u201cmaterial\u201d because they were intended to mislead and had the \npotential effect of influencing decision-makers to which they were addressed.22 I find \n                                                          \n \n22 Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a \nstatement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making \nbody to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004). \nMaking a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum sentence \nincludes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine).  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthat AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate false statements in the \u201cadditional \ncomments\u201d to Section 22 of his e-QIP. \n \nSix personal conduct mitigation conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant deliberately provided false information about the \ncircumstances surrounding his departure from Company B\u2019s employment. When \napplicants intentionally provide false information on their e-QIPs, they seriously \nundermine the entire security clearance investigation process. Throughout the security \nclearance adjudicative process, Applicant denied that he falsified his e-QIP. He has not \naccepted responsibility for his misconduct. I find that none of the mitigating conditions \napply to the security concerns arising under AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nwhole-person concept analysis. Applicant has worked in the defense industry for about \n20 years and held a security clearance for most of that time. Neverthess, his deliberate \nfalse statements on his e-QIP are serious, recent, and not mitigated. As such, I have \nconcerns about his current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts \nand circumstances, in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude he has not \nmitigated personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nOn June 25, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 24, 2010, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nApril 25, 2011\n\n2\nMaterial (FORM) on January 10, 2011, and did not respond with any information within\nthe 30 days permitted.  The case was assigned to me on March 24, 2010.  \nBesides its 12 exhibits (characterized as Items), the Government requested\nadministrative notice of six documents: Background Note: Egypt, U.S. Department of\nState (March 2010); Egypt Country Specific Information, U.S. Department of State\n(September 2010); Country Reports on Terrorism 2009: Chapter 2, Country reports:\nMiddle East and North Africa Overview, U.S. Department of State (August 2010);\nCountry Reports on Terrorism 2009: Foreign Terrorist Organizations, U.S. Department\nof State (August 2010); Human Rights Report: Egypt, U.S. Department of State (March\n2010); and Egypt: Background and U.S. Relations, CRS Report to Congress (May\n2009).  \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).\nAdministrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are\nwell known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good\ncause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named\nbackground reports addressing the geopolitical situation in Egypt. Administrative notice\nwas extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201\nof Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy\nand reliability of the information contained in the reports addressing Egypt\u2019s current\nstatus.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline C, Applicant allegedly (a) applied for and received an Egyptian\npassport in November 2004, even though he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in about\n1991; (b) receives a monthly pension from his Egyptian army service with a retirement\nrank of captain; (c) has a bank account in Egypt and has accumulated about $17,000\nUSD; (d) will inherit properties in Egypt; and (e) may return to Egypt to live once he\nretires. \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly (a) has a mother who is a citizen and\nresident of Egypt; (b) has two brothers and two sisters who are citizens and residents of\nEgypt; (c) has one sister who is employed by the Egyptian government; (d) has nieces\nand nephews who are citizens and residents of Egypt; (e) maintains regular contact\nwith his family members in Egypt; and (f) traveled to Egypt in at least 1991, 1993, 1995,\n1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2009.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations with\nexplanations. He explained that he is a highly-ethical individual, who has worked hard to\ncontinue to be the good citizen he has always been. He claimed he has never used his\nEgyptian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen for travel purposes and uses it only as\nevidence of his birth when visiting family members in Egypt. He claims that most jobs in\nEgypt are government-owned, and he only travels to Egypt to visit his family.  \n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior staff electronic engineer for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional\nfindings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant was born in Egypt. He attended schools in Egypt and earned a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in engineering in 1977. Upon graduating from college, he was\ncommissioned to serve in the Egyptian Army. He served between 1978 and 1984, and\nwas approved to attend military education classes in the United States. (Item 7)  \nWhile in the United States, Applicant met a U.S. citizen, who he married in July\n1983. (Item 5) He has no children from this marriage and divorced his wife in\nSeptember 1986. (Item 5)  \nApplicant accepted early retirement from the Egyptian Army in 1984 and moved\nto the United States the same year. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1991 (Item\n5) and  maintains dual citizenship with Egypt. Since immigrating to the United States,\nApplicant earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration from an accredited U.S.\ncollege in April 1995.  He has no U.S. military service.\nWhile Applicant expressed his exclusive allegiance to the United States, he has\ndeclined to consider renouncing or relinquishing his Egyptian citizenship. (Item 8) His\ncited reasons are several.  Loss of his Egyptian citizenship would place him at risk to\nforfeiture of his inheritance rights in Egypt. (Item 8) Applicant expects to inherit 1/5 of\none and a half of his mother\u2019s houses when she expires. (Item 7) Additionally,\nmaintaining his Egyptian citizenship has helped Applicant to better care for his family\nmembers, who reside in Egypt. (Item 8) Medical care, land purchases, and other official\nbusiness transactions are easier to pursue with Egyptian citizenship. (Item 8) Without\nEgyptian citizenship, he will not be able to conduct business in Egypt on behalf of his\nmother and siblings. (Item 8)  \nApplicant renewed his Egyptian passport in November 2004. (Item 4). It is valid\nuntil November 2011. He has never used his Egyptian passport for travel, and\nmaintains it only so he can provide proof of his birth in Egypt to Egyptian officials, if\nneeded. (Item 4) Although open to relinquishing his Egyptian passport, he claims he\ndoes not know how to do so.  So, his present intention is to retain his Egyptian passport\nuntil it expires. (Item 4)  \nBased on his Egyptian military retirement, Applicant receives a government\npension of about $150 a month in U.S. dollars. (Item 8) In accordance with his\ndisbursement instructions, the pension proceeds are deposited directly into a savings\naccount that he holds in an Egyptian bank. (Item 8) He has a current balance in this\naccount of about $17,000, a considerable increase over the $10,000 balance he\n\n1  Recent reports out of  Egypt following Mubarak\u2019s resignation suggest possible constitutional changes in\nEgyptian succession and voting procedures.  At this time, it is too early to tell what effects, if any, these\ndiscussed changes will have on selections and elections of new Egyptian leaders and the stabilization of\nEgypt\u2019s political, economic, and social institutions. At the present time, it is too soon to make reliable\npredictions as to how  Egypt\u2019s relations with its neighbors and W estern allies will  progress. \n4\nreported. (Item 8) This account includes his military pension deposits and some\nsavings. (Item 7) He has no other assets or accounts in Egypt. (Items 7 and 8) \nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has not voted in an Egyptian election, \nrun for public office in Egypt, or served in the Egyptian military. (Item 8) He has stated a\ndesire to retire to Egypt in the future (when he reaches retirement age) to enable him to\nbe closer to his family. (Item 8)\nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers, and two sisters all are citizens and residents of\nEgypt. Besides his immediate family, he also has nieces and nephews who are citizens\nand residents of Egypt. (Item 1) His mother\u2019s sole source of income is from her\ndeceased husband\u2019s retirement from the state-run newspaper. (Item 7) His two brothers\nwork at public high schools, one as a general manager, and the other as a vice\nprincipal. (Item 7)\nOne of Applicant\u2019s sisters is a tax auditor, possibly for the Egyptian government\u2019s\ntax department. (Item 7) His other sister and her husband work for the Egyptian\nagricultural ministry as a senior account manager and engineer, respectively. (Item 7)\nApplicant stays in touch with all of his family members by phone, email, or text\nmessaging about twice a month. (Item 8)\nRecords reveal that Applicant has traveled frequently to Egypt between 1991\nand 2009 to visit family members.  He acknowledged his regular pleasure visits to Egypt\nin 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2009 to visit his\nimmediate family members and other relatives.  (Item 8)  He assured that during his\nmany visits he never experienced any problems with customs officials or local\nauthorities. On these visits, he encountered no evidence of monitoring by a foreign\ngovernment and engaged in no activity or behavior that could place him in a position of\ncompromise. (Item 8)  \nEgypt\u2019s country status\nEgypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the second most-\npopulist country on the African continent. Background Note: Egypt, supra, at 2, U.S.\nDepartment of State (March 2010). It is a republic with a strong executive and a\ndeveloping economy that relies extensively on U..S. aid.  See id., at 4-6; Egypt Country\nSpecific Information, supra, at 1, U.S. Department of State (September 2010).  Hosni\nMubarak succeeded Anwar Sadat as Egypt\u2019s president following Sadat\u2019s assassination\nby Islamic extremists in October 1981. He was confirmed by popular referendum for\nfour additional six-year terms in September 2005.   See Background Note: Egypt,\n1\nsupra, at 4.  \nOver the past 40 years, Egypt has been a strong military and strategic partner of\nthe United States. See Background Note: Egypt, supra, at 8 In the past, it has played\n\n5\nan important role in Middle East security and peace initiatives in the Gulf crisis and in\njoint military exercises. The United States and Egypt have long enjoyed a strong and\nfriendly geopolitical relationship based on shared mutual interests in Middle East peace\nand stability, revitalizing the Egyptian economy, strengthening trade relations, and\npromoting regional security. See Background Note: Egypt; supra; Egypt: Background\nand U.S. Relations, supra, at 6. \nDespite strong U.S.-Egyptian strategic interests, Egypt has continued to suffer\nfrom terrorist attacks in recent years. See Background Note: Egypt, supra, at 5. These\nattacks generally coincide with major local holidays and strike near tourist sites. See\nEgypt Country Specific Information, supra, at 3. In April 2009, for instance, the Egyptian\ngovernment \u201cuncovered a 49-person Hezbollah cell clandestinely operating in Egypt.\u201d\nSee Egypt: Background and U.S. Relations, supra, at 20. Criminal networks that may\nbe associated with terrorist groups in the region, including Hezbollah, have used\ntunnels located in Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai region to smuggle humans, weapons, and\nother contraband into Israel and the Gaza Strip. See Country Reports on Terrorism\n2009: Chapter 2-Country Reports: Middle East and North Africa Overview, supra, at 3. \nEgypt\u2019s human rights record is considered poor by U.S. State Department\nstandards, and serious abuses continue in many areas.  See Human rights Report:\nEgypt, supra, at 1; Egypt: Background and U.S. Relations, supra (noting the inherent\ntensions and contradictions facing U.S.-Egyptian relations as a result of the Egyptian\ngovernment\u2019s repressive human rights practices).  \nEgypt considers all children born to Egyptian fathers to be Egyptian citizens,\neven if the Egyptian birth certificate or passport is not issued.  Dual nationals residing in\nEgypt for more than six months require proof of Egyptian citizenship, such as a family\nI.D. card.  Male dual nationals staying in Egypt for more than six months from the date\nof arrival and who have not completed military service must obtain an exemption\ncertificate through the Ministry of Defense before they can leave Egypt.  Individuals who\ntravel to Egypt on their Egyptian passports are normally treated as Egyptian citizens by\nthe local government. Available consular assistance for those traveling on Egyptian\npassports is extremely limited.  See Egypt Country Specific Information, supra, at 7.\nEndorsements\nApplicant provided no endorsements or performance evaluations on his behalf.\nNor did he provide any proof of community and civic contributions. Afforded an\nopportunity to supplement the record, he provided no additional information about his\nwork and personal life.  \n                        \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\n\n6\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines\nare to be considered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n \nForeign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate\npreference  for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful\nto the interests of the United States.  See AG \u00b6  9.\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\n\n7\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  See AG \u00b6 6.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a senior staff electronic engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. Born and raised in Egypt, Applicant immigrated to the\nUnited States in 1984 after completing his schooling and military service in Egypt.\nAfter becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1991 and receiving a U.S. passport, he\nretained his Egyptian citizenship and passport and became a dual citizen with Egypt.\nHis dual citizenship status enables him to retain all of the rights, privileges, and\nresponsibilities that inhere with Egyptian citizenship.  And when his Egyptian passport\nwas due to expire, he renewed it in 2004 and continues to carry it with him for\nevidentiary purposes when he travels to Egypt to visit his relatives. \n\n8\nSecurity concerns in this case relate to both foreign preference and foreign\ninfluence associated with Applicant\u2019s longstanding family and property ties to Egypt,\nhis retaining his Egyptian citizenship with no expressed intentions to consider\nrenouncing or relinquishing it, and his renewal of his Egyptian passport with the\nintention of retaining it for citizenship evidentiary purposes when he travels to Egypt to\nsee his family. \nForeign Preference \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference for the interests of the foreign\ncountry over the interests of the United States. The issues, as such, raise concerns\nover Applicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the United States. By virtue of\nhis retaining his Egyptian citizenship, accepting pension privileges, preserving\ninheritance entitlements, keeping an Egyptian bank account, and renewing his\nEgyptian passport after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant exercised\nactive citizenship with Egypt. His actions create considerable doubts about which\ncountry he prefers. \nAfforded opportunities to surrender his Egyptian passport and consider\nrenouncing his Egyptian citizenship to the Egyptian Embassy, or other authorized\npublic authority, Applicant declined to do so.  As a result, Applicant may not claim any\nof the mitigating conditions available for surrenders of foreign passports and\nrenouncements of foreign citizenship. Whether Applicant\u2019s collective actions reflect an\noverall preference for his birth country (Egypt), or retained dual citizenship options\nthat are not incompatible with his imposed fiduciary duties to the United States, are\nissues that require reconciling with the security requirements demanded of those who\nare afforded access to classified information. \nSince becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken several actions\nand exercised Egyptian privileges that reflect active indicia of dual citizenship.\nSpecifically, he retained his Egyptian passport and used his passport to provide\nEgyptian citizenship evidence during his regular travels to Egypt between 1991 and\n2009. Applicant also exercises privileges of Egyptian citizenship in other discrete\nways: He continues to receive a monthly pension from his Egyptian army service; he\nretains an Egyptian bank account that continues to increase in size; he preserved his\ninheritance rights; and his considered retirement to Egypt when he reaches retirement\nage. He declined to take any active steps to date to surrender his Egyptian passport\nand expressed no tangible willingness to renounce his Egyptian citizenship. \nIn assessing split-preference cases, the Appeal Board has looked to indicia of\nactive exercise of dual citizenship. Where the subject applicant has relied on his\nforeign citizenship and passport to own and service property in a foreign country that\nrestricts ownership and inheritance rights to residents and individuals with citizenship\nin that country, the Board has considered such actions to constitute important\nconsiderations of preference. See ISCR Case No. 16098 at 2 (App. Bd. May 29,\n2003). Because holding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between\nthe Government and the clearance holder, preference questions acquire added\nsecurity significance. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Split\n\n9\npreferences (as here) can place increased strains on the clearance holder where\nconflicts over safeguarding  classified materials and protecting the clearance holder\u2019s\nprivate foreign interests arise. \nHere, Applicant used his Egyptian birth and citizen status to retain and use his\nEgyptian passport when traveling to Egypt (even if limited to evidentiary purposes)\nand renew his Egyptian passport that enables him to enter and exit Egypt with\nminimum amounts of interference and inconvenience. His retention of his Egyptian\ncitizenship and passport enables him to qualify for acceptance of prospective\ninheritance benefits and continued receipt of his Egyptian military pension benefits.\nHis actions represent material indicia of a preference for Egypt that cannot be easily\nreconciled with the split preference he has shown for many years for his adopted\ncountry, the United States.  \nPreference questions require predictive judgments about how an applicant can\nbe trusted in the future to honor his fiduciary responsibilities to the Government. In\nApplicant\u2019s case, he was manifestly aware of the security significance of his choosing\nto retain his Egyptian citizenship and an Egyptian passport while continuing to hold a\nU.S. security clearance. For he has declined to take any actions to surrender and\nrenounce after being apprised of the Government\u2019s concerns in the SOR. While his\nchoices may be understandable, they also reflect a current and ongoing preference\nfor his roots in Egypt over his expressed allegiances for the United States.   \nBecause Applicant retains his Egyptian citizenship and Egyptian passport while\nholding U.S. citizenship and a U.S. passport, the Government may apply certain\nprovisions of disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) of AG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member.\u201c This DC includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such      \n              benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another \n              country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election. \nSpecifically, DC \u00b6 10(a)(1),  (3) and (5) both apply to the established facts and\ncircumstances herein.  By retaining his Egyptian citizenship and passport, Applicant is\nable to accept and preserve special travel, pension and inheritance rights in Egypt\nthat are not currently available to non-Egyptian residents and citizens.\n\n10\nWere Applicant to renounce his Egyptian citizenship and unconditionally\nsurrender his Egyptian passport, he risks a potential forfeiture of his pension and\ninheritance rights and increased surveillance and inconvenience when he travels to\nEgypt to visit his family members. His election to retain the Egyptian citizenship and\npassport represent entirely rational and understandable choices on Applicant\u2019s part.\nThey also reflect clear preferences for his home country of Egypt, where he could\nretire in the future.  No mitigating conditions are available to Applicant under the facts\npresented. \nWhole-person precepts do not enable Applicant to circumvent conclusions\nreached through an analysis of the individual disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nthe foreign preference guideline. Afforded an opportunity to provide endorsements,\npersonnel evaluations, and other data about himself, he declined to do so. \nOverall, Applicant is not able to persuade that his current preference is still with\nthe United States. Because he made considerable use of Egyptian privileges\nassociated with his retaining and exercising his Egyptian citizenship privileges and\npassport, he manifested a preference for Egypt under the criteria as established by\nthe Appeal Board. Applicant fails to absolve himself of foreign preference concerns\nassociated with the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his adopted\ncountry (United States), or the country where he was born and raised (Egypt).\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraph 1.a of Guideline C.\nForeign Influence \nApplicant and his family have deep roots in Egypt, a country with historically\ngood relations with the United States, but also one occupied by terrorist groups and\ncredited with a poor human rights record. With the fall of the Mubarak government, it\nis still too soon to make any sound predictive assessments about Egypt\u2019s political\nfuture and economic well-being. \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers residing in Egypt, who either are employed by the Egyptian government or\nreceive government retirement benefits, might be placed at risk to disclose material\ninformation about Applicant. Applicant still has his mother, two brothers, and two\nsisters who reside in Egypt and maintain regular contact with Applicant. His Egyptian\ncontacts provide potential opportunities to exploit his retirement savings and other\ncash assets in his bank account in Egypt as he further considers potential plans for\nretirement in Egypt.\nBecause he still has his mother and four siblings with likely government\naffiliations residing in Egypt, he could  be subject to undue foreign influence by\nEgyptian government authorities to access sensitive proprietary information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control. As such, he and his family present potential\nheightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with\na foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the\n\n11\nAGs for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of these family members in\nEgypt, combined with Applicant\u2019s own demonstrated preference for the country, do\npose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign\ninfluence that could potentially affect his use of his monetary assets and close\nimmediate and extended family ties in Egypt.   \nApplicant has both family members and material assets in Egypt that he pays\nclose attention to on a regular basis. Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he has made\nregular trips to Egypt to visit his family members, and he carries his Egyptian passport\nwith him on these trips for Egyptian birth validation purposes. Possession of Egyptian\nand U.S. passports on his family visits can enhance the risks of his movements being\nmonitored and scrutinized.  Potential conflicts that might be associated with his having\nclose family members, a bank account, and dual passports in his possession during\nhis trips to Egypt are potentially major ones. And from all that is known, most of\nApplicant\u2019s family members are either employed by the Egypt government or receive\ngovernment retirement benefits, and are sources of.potentially serious conflicts in the\nrelatively unstructured and uncontrolled political and security environment of present-\nday  Egypt. \n Because most of Applicant\u2019s living family members residing in Egypt with\ngovernment affiliations or connections have potential conflict situations with Applicant\nthat could place them at risk to pressure and compromise, application of \u00b6 DC 7(b),\n\u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d is warranted herein.\nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one\nforeign country may not be in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical\nnecessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Egypt. Unlike the\nold AGs, the new ones do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with\nthe United States as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular\nrelatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk.\nThe geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  is\npartially available to Applicant. Current security and political conditions in Egypt pose\nsome heightened security risks that could subject them to potential pressures and\ninfluence from Egyptian government and military officials. \nOf little benefit to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\n\n12\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\npreferences and commitments to the United States are not sufficiently demonstrated\nunder these circumstances to neutralize potential conflicts that are implicit in his\nmonetary interests and relationships with his immediate family members and other\nrelatives in Egypt. MC \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d has little  applicability, too, based on Applicant\u2019s exhibited\nfrequent communications and regular visits with his family members in Egypt.  \n \n MC \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d is not available to\nApplicant. His financial interests in Egypt are considerable and are likely to continue\nto grow as they have over the course of the past three years.\nNot available to Applicant either is MC \u00b6 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly\ncomplied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts,\nrequests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country.\u201d\nThere is no evidence presented in the record that Applicant promptly notified and\nbriefed his employer on his returns from his visits to Egypt between 1991 and 2009.  \nWhole-person assessment is not available to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nany potential conflicts of interests with his Egyptian family members residing in Egypt.\nWithout any endorsements, personnel evaluations, or other pertinent data to evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s overall security risks, any discounting of security risks assigned through\nthe use of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the foreign influence guideline\ncannot be safely made. \nOverall, security concerns attributable to Applicant's having property interests\nand family members residing in Egypt are not sufficiently mitigated to permit safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand any Egyptian risks of undue\ninfluence. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuideline B.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nB, C, and E on March 8, 2010. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 12, 2010. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations dated March 26, 2010, and\nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOctober 6, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Nov. 17,\n2009).\nItem 5 (Security clearance application).\n2\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on June 7, 2010. Applicant received the FORM on July 7,\n2010. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response. DOHA assigned\nthis case to me on September 1, 2010. The Government submitted eight exhibits, which\nhave been marked as Items 1-8 and admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to\nthe SOR has been marked and admitted as Item 3, and the SOR has been marked as\nItem 1.\nEvidentiary Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Israel. The request and the attached documents were not\nadmitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Exhibits I-VII. The facts\nadministratively noticed will be limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not\nsubject to reasonable dispute, and are set out in the Findings of Fact below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a(1)-\n1.a(5), and 2.a-2.h of the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c of the SOR.  He also provided\n1\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant, who is 79 years old, owns a company which contracts with the\nDepartment of Defense on defense-related products. He has held a secret clearance\nsince 1995 without incident.  \n2\nApplicant was born in Iran in 1931. His family moved to Israel in 1949. Along with\nhis family members, he became an Israeli citizen. His family returned to Iran in 1952,\nwhere they remained until 1979. With the fall of the government of the Shah of Iran, he\n\nItem 7.\n3\nItem 5; Item 6.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s Israeli passport shows these dates, not the  August 10,  2006 and August 9, 2016 dates identified\n5\nin the SOR. Items 1 and 6.\nItem 4-Item 6.\n6\nItem 5; Item 7.\n7\nItem 3; Item 7.\n8\n3\nand his family moved to the United States. His family owned property and businesses in\nIran, which were seized around 1980 by the new Iranian government.3\nApplicant married in February 1960. He has four children, ages 48, 47, 43, and\n35. His wife and children were born in Iran. As he did in 1987, they became naturalized\ncitizens of the United States between 1985 and 1988. Applicant has a passport issued\nby the United States in July 2004. This passport will expire in July 2014.4\nApplicant claims dual citizenship with Israel, but not with Iran. In 2006, Applicant\napplied to renew his Israeli passport that expired in 1979. Israel issued him a new\npassport on October 8, 2006, which will expire on September 8, 2016.  Applicant\n5\nobtained this passport because he understood that as an Israeli citizen, he was required\nto have an Israeli passport. Since 2006, Applicant has used his Israeli passport to enter\nand leave Israel. Prior to October 2006, he used his U.S. passport to enter and leave\nIsrael. He uses his U.S. passport for his travels to other countries in the world.6\nApplicant owns two businesses in the United States. For almost 20 years, he has\nowned and operated a manufacturing business, which has contracts with the\nDepartment of Defense. Since 1986, he has been a partner in an investment business\nwith family members. The investment business owns and manages four hotels, 150\napartment units, five restaurants, and a water/sewer development project in the United\nStates. The investment business is also a partner in four other hotels in the United\nStates. The value of his business and investments in the United States is unknown.7\nSince 1973, Applicant, his brother, uncles, and cousins have owned 22.5 acres\nof undeveloped land in Israel. His ownership share is 12.5%. He also owns an\napartment in Israel valued in 2008 at $800,000, which his family uses when they travel\nto Israel. In 2008, he, his wife, and his children purchased a 16-story commercial\nbuilding in Israel for $55,000,000. He financed 87% of this purchase. His tenants in this\nbuilding include the Israeli government, who was a tenant when he purchased the\nbuilding. The property is managed by a local professional property management\ncompany, which works directly with the tenants, negotiates the rental contracts, and\nperforms the needed repairs. He is not directly involved in the daily operations of this\nbuilding.8\n\nItem 5; Item 7.\n9\nItem 5; Item 7.\n10\nItem 3; Item 7.\n11\n4\nApplicant\u2019s closest family members, his wife, children, and brother, are U.S.\ncitizens, who live and work in the United States. His relatives in Israel are more distant,\nsuch as uncles and cousins. The level of contact with these relatives is unknown. He\nmaintains contact with one old friend, who is a high ranking official in the Israeli\ngovernment. He visits with his friend for personal reasons when he is in Israel. They do\nnot discuss work-related matters or his businesses. Applicant\u2019s investment clients in\nIsrael comprise about 7% of his clients.9\nApplicant and his immediate family established a philanthropic foundation in\nIsrael which focuses on education. Applicant indicates he has philanthropic enterprises\nin the United States, but the nature and type of these enterprises are unknown. From\n1998 through  2008, Applicant traveled at least once a year to Israel. During this same\nperiod of time, he traveled to many countries around the world, including Turkey,\nGreece, the United Arab Emirates, China, Japan, United Kingdom, Argentina, Uruguay,\nAustralia, New Zealand, and continental Europe.10\nIn his response to the SOR and in his personal interview, Applicant indicated he\nwould give up his Israeli citizenship to obtain his security clearance. He is willing to do\nso because \u201chis allegiance is to the United States above all other nations - it is to the\nUnited States that I owe my ultimate loyalty.\u201d11\nWhen he completed his e-QIP April 16, 2008, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing questions:\nSection 17. Your Foreign Activities\nc.\nHave you ever had any contact with a foreign government, its\nestablishments (embassies or consulates), or its representatives,\nwhether inside or outside the U.S., other than on official U.S.\nGovernment business? (Does not include routine visa applications\nand border crossing contacts.)\nd.\nIn the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was\nissued by a foreign government?\nApplicant denies any \u201ccontact\u201d with the Israel government that would require an\naffirmative response to 17c and 17d. His local professional property manager handles\nall tenancy issues. He has no direct contact with the Israel government about the use of\nthis building or tenancy issues. Applicant states that he submitted an Electronic\n\nThis document is not in the record.\n12\nItem 3,; Item 4.\n13\nItem 3; Item 7.\n14\n5\nPersonnel Security Questionnaire in 2005.  Module 15 asked if he had an active\n12\nforeign passport within the last seven years and he answered \u201cno\u201d, as his old Israeli\npassport had expired in 1979. He prepared his 2008 e-QIP, using his 2005 responses\nas a starting point. His prior \u201cno\u201d answer was missed and not corrected. He\nacknowledged his dual citizenship with Israel in Section 8d.13\nApplicant denies falsifying material facts about his Israeli passport when he met\nwith the security clearance investigator in July 2008. Applicant states that he intended to\ncommunicate to the investigator that he \u201cwas not sure that I would renew my Israeli\npassport but ultimately decided to do so.\u201d He states that he thought the line of\nquestioning was about why he waited so long to renew his Israeli passport not whether\nhe had one or not.14\nISRAEL\nI take administrative notice of the following facts.  In 1948, Israel became an\nindependent nation. It immediately engaged in a war with all of its neighbors. Armed\nconflict has marked every decade of Israel\u2019s existence. Despite these conflicts, Israel\ndeveloped a vibrant parliamentary democracy with relatively fragile governments. \nIsrael\u2019s foreign policy focuses largely on its region, Europe, and the United\nStates. Israel views Iran as an existential threat due to its nuclear ambitions and support\nfor anti-Israel terrorists. Israel seeks to achieve peace with its neighbors. Israel\nnegotiated peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994, but has not with Syria\nand Lebanon. In 2006, Israel and Syria, where Hezbollah controls the south, engaged in\na 34-day war after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in July 2006. The parties\nagreed to a cease-fire, which is holding and is monitored by the United Nations. Israel\nnegotiated a series of agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s, but this process\nended in 2000. Talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) resumed in\n2007. A peace agreement has not yet been reached.\nIsrael and the United States developed a close friendship based on common\ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. The United States-Israel\nbilateral relations are multidimensional. The United States is the principal proponent of\nthe Arab-Israeli peace process, but the United States and Israel views differ on some\nissues, such as the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and settlements. The United States\nsupported Israel\u2019s 2006 campaign against Hezbollah and Hamas, and its 2008/2009\noffensive against Hamas as acts of self-defense. The current administration considers\nIsrael a strong ally of the United States.\n\nExhibits I-VII.\n15\n6\nThe United States and Israel concluded a free-trade agreement in 1985 and\nIsrael is a prominent recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The United States and Israel have\nclose security relations. Issues between the United States and Israel include Israel\u2019s\nmilitary sales, Israel\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, and\nespionage-related cases. In 1986, Israel and the United States signed an agreement for\nIsraeli participation in the Strategic Defense Initiative, under which Israel is developing\nthe Arrow anti-ballistic missile with a significant financial contribution from the United\nStates.\nIsrael is a major trading partner with the United States, United Kingdom, and\nGermany. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy. Government\nownership is decreasing and private sector ownership of business is increasing. Israel is\nan active collector of information and technology in the United States. In the past, Israel\nhas recruited U.S. citizens to spy for it and has received classified information as a\nresult.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\n\n7\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. I\nhave considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008).\n16\n8\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation.\nApplicant, his wife, and his children are all U.S. citizens and reside in the United\nStates. Applicant, but not his wife and children, claims dual citizenship with Israel. He,\nhis wife, and children became U.S. citizens over 20 years ago. His relationships with his\nwife and children are not a security concern. He has distant relatives in Israel with\nwhom he has owned for nearly forty years, an undeveloped piece of property in Israel.\nThe extent of his contacts with these individuals is unknown. His extended family\nrelationships are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance, but these\nrelationships must be considered in deciding whether to grant Applicant a clearance.\nThese distant family relationships were not shown to create a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion or to create a potential\nconflict of interest with his obligations to protect sensitive information.  \nApplicant, however, owns two properties in Israel, which together are worth\nalmost $56,000,000. The Israeli government rents office space in his commercial\nproperty. In addition, Applicant owns an undeveloped piece of land with distant\nrelatives, has a family educational foundation in Israel, and has a long-time friend whom\nhe meets when he is in Israel. This friend holds a high-level position in the Israeli\ngovernment. As with his family, his relationship with his friend, his foundation, and his\nproperty are not per se reasons to deny Applicant a security clearance, but must be\nconsidered in deciding whether to grant Applicant a clearance. The Government must\nestablish that his friend, his foundation, and his property ownership create a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion or create a\npotential conflict of interest between his obligations to protect sensitive information and\nhis desire to protect his property or help his friend.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nwith his friend, the nature of his foundation, and his property interests as well as the\nactivities of the government of Israel and terrorist organizations operating in Israel.16\nThe risk that an applicant could be targeted for manipulation or induced into\ncompromising classified information is real, not theoretical. Applicant\u2019s friend, his\nfoundation, and his property interests raise a heightened risk of security concerns\nbecause of the espionage activities of the Israeli government and its known efforts to\nrecruit U.S. citizens. \nUnder the guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\n\n9\ninterests. In determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts and property in Israel cause security\nconcerns, I considered that Israel and the United States have a close relationship and\nthat Israel cooperates with the United States in the fight against terrorism. That said,\nthere is evidence that the Israeli government targets United States citizens for protected\ninformation. While none of these considerations by themselves dispose of the issue,\nthey are all factors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure\nor coercion because of his friend and his business investments. Because of the\nespionage activities of Israel, Applicant\u2019s property, foundation, and contacts with his\nfriend in Israel raise a heightened risk concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b) and (e).\nAG \u00b6 8  provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation;\n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority;\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing aItemncy\nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from\npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and,\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\nI have considered al the mitigating conditions and conclude that Applicant has\nnot mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns about his contacts with Israel with the\nexception of the undeveloped land. His ownership share in this parcel of land is small\nand is not likely to be create a conflict of interest for him. Guideline B is found against\nApplicant, except for SOR \u00b6 2.h.\n\n10\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[w]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1)\npossession of a current foreign passport; and\n(5)\nusing foreign citizenship to protect financial or\nbusiness interests in another country.\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen.\nApplicant renewed his Israeli passport nearly 20 years after he became a U.S.\ncitizen and 27 years after his prior Israeli passport expired. By renewing his Israeli\npassport, he sought recognition of his Israeli citizenship. After he renewed his Israeli\npassport, he purchased a commercial property worth $55,000,000. The Government\nhas established a security concern under Guideline C.\nUnder AG \u00b6 11, the following conditions may mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns in this case:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority;\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n\n11\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\n \nApplicant claims Israeli citizenship along with his U. S. citizenship, although he\nstates that his only allegiance is to the United States. Besides his Israel passport, he\nowns two expensive properties in Israel. He owns many properties in the United States\nand a U.S. business. Applicant indicated a willingness to renounce his Israeli\ncitizenship, but has not done so.\nApplicant voluntarily chose to renew his Israeli passport many years after he\nbecame a U.S. citizen. Even though he claimed dual citizenship with Israel, Applicant\ntraveled to and from Israel on his U.S. passport for many years prior to renewing his\nIsraeli passport. He provided no evidence that Israel pressured him, as an Israeli\ncitizen, to obtain a passport. Thus, his explanation that he renewed the Israeli passport\nbecause he believed that as an Israeli citizen he was required to have a passport is not\ncredible. After renewing his Israeli passport, he used it to enter into and travel in Israel\nfor his own purposes, not on behalf of a governmental authority. He also purchased\nproperty in 2008 in Israel. He continues to hold his Israeli passport. By so doing, he\nexhibits a preference for Israel. Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline C, despite his expressed willingness to renounce his Israeli\ncitizenship for a security clearance.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n17\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n12\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer must be deliberate. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 17c and 17d on his e-\nQIP. He indicated that he did not have an active foreign passport nor did he have\ncontacts with a foreign government, its embassies, or representatives. He omitted\nmaterial facts about his Israeli passport and contacts in Israel when he completed his e-\nQIP. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold\na security clearance and to his honesty. In his response, he denies that he had an intent\nto hide this information from the Government. When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the Government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when\nthe omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.17\nWhen he completed his e-QIP in April 2008, Applicant knew he had an active\nIsraeli passport, which had been issued to him 18 months earlier. The Government has\nestablished its case under Guideline E as to SOR \u00b6 3(b).\nApplicant denied having governmental contacts in Israel. He uses a professional\nproperty manager to handle all matters, including leasing agreements, related to the\ntenants in his commercial building. He does not have any direct contact with the\ntenants, including the Israel government tenants. Because he uses a professional\nproperty manager and he did not understand foreign \u201ccontacts\u201d to be contacts by his\nproperty manager, I conclude that he did not intentionally falsify his answer to Question\n17c or attempt to hide information about his foreign contacts from the Government.\nSOR \u00b6 3.a is found in favor of Applicant.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(b) to apply, Applicant must have deliberately provided false or\nmisleading information to the security clearance investigator about the existence of a\ncurrent Israeli passport. Applicant denies intentionally or deliberately providing false\ninformation about his Israeli passport. He states that he intended to communicate to the\ninvestigator that he was not sure if he would renew his Israeli passport, but that he\nultimately decided to do so. Applicant\u2019s explanation is not plausible because he\nrenewed his Israeli passport 18 months before he completed his e-QIP. He decided\nlong before he completed his e-QIP and met with the security clearance investigator to\nrenew his Israeli passport after 25 years without a valid passport. He possessed an\nactive Israeli passport at the time he met with the investigator. I find that Applicant\ndeliberately provided false and misleading information to the security clearance\ninvestigator. The Government established its case under AG \u00b6 16(b).\nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and conclude that none\nfo the mitigating conditions are applicable in this case.\n\n13\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or deny a\nsecurity clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is\na highly sophisticated businessman, who owns property in the United States and Israel.\nHe is experienced in completing forms and is familiar with complicated documents. He\nunderstands the need to read all documents carefully before signing them. He knew that\nhe had an active Israeli passport and chose not to reveal this information on his e-QIP\nor to the security clearance investigator. He owns two properties in Israel by choice. He\ncontinues to claim dual citizenship with Israel and has not renounced his Israeli\ncitizenship. For many years, he did not hold an active Israeli passport. Four years ago,\nhe decided to renew his long-expired Israeli passport. He has not surrendered or\ndestroyed his Israeli passport. By these actions, he has shown a preference for Israel,\nand through his property ownership, he has the potential to be influenced or coerced by\nthe Israeli government. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For the above reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under the guidelines for\nforeign influence, foreign preference, and personal conduct.\n\n14\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a (1):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a (2):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a (3):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a (4):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a (5):\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Analysis portion of her decision, the Judge acknowledged the passage of time since Applicant\u2019s last security violation. However, she concluded that this was not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s security violations, especially insofar as, during the intervening years, Applicant had limited access to classified information, which diminished her opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation. The Judge also noted that following her various security incidents Applicant had received counseling, yet she committed further violations despite that fact. Regarding the false statement, the Judge properly took notice of the other, more recent, falsifications, which are inconsistent with rehabilitation and reform. Applicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence, or did not properly weigh the evidence, to include her many years of incident-free service and the supportive testimony provided by co-workers and friends. However, Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010). Neither is Applicant\u2019s presentation sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision was contrary to the greater weight of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01970 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2010). Once it is established that an applicant has committed security violations, he or she has a \u201cvery heavy ",

Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 20, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected\nInformation) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.\n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 30, 2010, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of\nthe Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a senior administrative associate for a defense contractor\u2019s\nsecurity department.  She has worked for this employer since 1984 and has held her current position\nsince November 2005.  She has held a security clearance since 1984.\nBetween 2001 and 2005 Applicant committed five security violations.  On four occasions\nshe failed to secure the document control area and on another she failed to protect a classified\ndocument.  Regarding this last incident, the document was knocked off Applicant\u2019s desk into a waste\nbasket and deposited in a trash bin.  It was recovered six days later at a refuse facility.  Additionally,\nApplicant used marijuana from 1974 until 1995 and cocaine from 1986 until 1994.  Much of this use\noccurred while Applicant held a security clearance.  In 1997 Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a question\non her security clearance application (SCA) as to whether she had used illegal drugs within the\nprevious seven years.  This answer was false, due to the drug use described above.  Additionally,\nin SCAs completed in 1997, 2002, and 2008 Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a question inquiring about\nwhether she had ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance.  Although these false\nanswers were not alleged in the SOR, the Judge considered them on the question of rehabilitation.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.

    "discussion": ", we affirm the decision of the Judge. The Judge found that Applicant is a senior administrative associate for a defense contractor\u2019s security department. She has worked for this employer since 1984 and has held her current position since November 2005. She has held a security clearance since 1984. Between 2001 and 2005 Applicant committed five security violations. On four occasions she failed to secure the document control area and on another she failed to protect a classified document. Regarding this last incident, the document was knocked off Applicant\u2019s desk into a waste basket and deposited in a trash bin. It was recovered six days later at a refuse facility. Additionally, Applicant used marijuana from 1974 until 1995 and cocaine from 1986 until 1994. Much of this use occurred while Applicant held a security clearance. In 1997 Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a question on her security clearance application (SCA) as to whether she had used illegal drugs within the previous seven years. This answer was false, due to the drug use described above. Additionally, in SCAs completed in 1997, 2002, and 2008 Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a question inquiring about whether she had ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. Although these false answers were not alleged in the SOR, the Judge considered them on the question of rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). In the Analysis portion of her decision, the Judge acknowledged the passage of time since Applicant\u2019s last security violation. However, she concluded that this was not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s security violations, especially insofar as, during the intervening years, Applicant had limited access to classified information, which diminished her opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation. The Judge also noted that following her various security incidents Applicant had received counseling, yet she committed further violations despite that fact. Regarding the false statement, the Judge properly took notice of the other, more recent, falsifications, which are inconsistent with rehabilitation and reform. Applicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence, or did not properly weigh the evidence, to include her many years of incident-free service and the supportive testimony provided by co-workers and friends. However, Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010). Neither is Applicant\u2019s presentation sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision was contrary to the greater weight of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01970 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2010).

Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, that Applicant failed to properly secure a closed area in April 2001 (SOR 1.a), April 2004 (SOR 1.c), September 2004 (SOR 1.d), and June 2005 (SOR 1.e), and that in October 2002, she failed to secure a secret-level classified document, which was later found in a dumpster (SOR 1.b). Applicant was allegedly removed from her position in document control and reassigned because of these security violations (SOR 1.f). Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified security clearance applications completed in May 1997 (SOR 2.a) and in November 2002 (SOR 2.b) by not disclosing her usage of marijuana and cocaine from about 1970 to 1995. Applicant admitted the allegations when she answered the SOR. But at her hearing, she denied falsification of her November 2002 security clearance application. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old senior administrative associate in a defense contractor\u2019s security department. She has worked for her employer since September 1984, and held her present position since about November 2005. (Ex. 10, 11.) Before then, she was a security administrator in document control.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant violated the Department of Defense\u2019s regulations for the safeguarding\nof classified information while employed as a document control specialist. In October\n2002, her careless handling of a classified document led to it being vulnerable to\ncompromise for six days. She failed to properly secure a closed area in April 2001, April\n2004, September 2004, and June 2005. Her pattern of inadvertent security violations\nraises considerable doubts about whether she can be counted on to address security\nresponsibilities with the care and attention required. Applicant deliberately omitted her\nuse of marijuana from 1974 to mid-1995 and of cocaine from 1986 to mid-1995 from her\nMay 1997 security clearance application. Clearance denied.\nStatement of the Case \nOn August 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that\nprovided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her a security clearance. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nAugust 30, 2010\n\n2\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 11, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing. On December 11, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nher. With the agreement of the parties, I scheduled a hearing for January 11, 2010.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Fourteen Government exhibits (Ex. 1-14)\nand five Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were admitted into evidence without objection.\nApplicant and three witnesses testified on her behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on January 21, 2010.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nAt the hearing, Applicant moved to amend her answer to SOR 2.b based on her\ntestimony that she did not intentionally falsify her November 2002 security clearance\napplication. I granted the motion over the Government\u2019s objections while advising the\nparties that it did not relieve me of the obligation to make findings of fact based on all\nthe evidence. Department Counsel declined an offer of additional time to prepare a\nresponse.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, that\nApplicant failed to properly secure a closed area in April 2001 (SOR 1.a), April 2004\n(SOR 1.c), September 2004 (SOR 1.d), and June 2005 (SOR 1.e), and that in October\n2002, she failed to secure a secret-level classified document, which was later found in a\ndumpster (SOR 1.b). Applicant was allegedly removed from her position in document\ncontrol and reassigned because of these security violations (SOR 1.f). Under Guideline\nE, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified security\nclearance applications completed in May 1997 (SOR 2.a) and in November 2002 (SOR\n2.b) by not disclosing her usage of marijuana and cocaine from about 1970 to 1995.\nApplicant admitted the allegations when she answered the SOR. But at her hearing, she\ndenied falsification of her November 2002 security clearance application. After\nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior administrative associate in a defense\ncontractor\u2019s security department. She has worked for her employer since September\n1984, and held her present position since about November 2005. (Ex. 10, 11.) Before\nthen, she was a security administrator in document control. She has been at her present\nduty location since June 2009. (Tr. 59.) Applicant was initially granted a secret-level\nsecurity clearance in 1984. (Ex. 10.) She seeks to retain the top-secret level security\nclearance that she has held since October 1997. (Ex. 13.)\n\nThe NISPOM provides for the use of closed areas for the storage of classified material in \u00a7 5-306.\n1\nAccess to controlled areas must be controlled to preclude unauthorized access, by the use of a cleared\nemployee or by a supplementing access control device or system. Access shall be limited to authorized\npersons with appropriate level of security clearance and a need-to-know the information within the closed\narea. Persons lacking the clearance and need-to-know must be escorted at all times by an authorized person\nwhere inadvertent or unauthorized exposure to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively\nprevented. During non-working hours, closed areas must have supplemental protection. Admittance to closed\nareas shall be controlled by locked entrances and exits secured by either an approved built-in combination\nlock or an approved combination or key-operated padlock. Doors secured from the inside with a panic bolt,\ndead bolt, a rigid wood or metal bar, or other means approved by the cognizant security agency, do not require\nadditional locking devices. (Ex. 6.)\n3\nHandling Protected Information\nApplicant began working for her employer as a document control specialist with a\nsecret-level security clearance in September 1984. In 1997, she was issued a top-\nsecret security clearance. (Ex. 1, 2, 13.) Over the years, she received security briefings,\nincluding annual refresher briefings, a controlled area briefing in March 2001, and\nclosed area briefings in November 2001 and September 2004. (Ex. 1-5.) As a cleared\nemployee, Applicant had a responsibility under the National Industrial Security Program\nOperating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M, to safeguard classified information\nentrusted to her. See DoD 5220.22 \u00a7 5-101 (stating, \u201cIndividuals are responsible for\nsafeguarding classified information entrusted to them. The extent of protection afforded\nclassified information shall be sufficient to reasonably foreclose the possibility of its loss\nor compromise.\u201d) Applicant met her employer\u2019s expectations in her primary role as\ncustomer support in document control, processing incoming and outgoing classified\nmaterial into the facility. She was considered by her employer as very capable, but she\nneeded to expand her knowledge of security to become more effective. She did not\nmeet some of the training goals in 2003 or 2004, such as completing Defense Security\nService (DSS) correspondence courses on the essentials of security management and\nprotecting secret and confidential documents. (Ex. A.) Gaining more familiarity with the\nNISPOM requirements for safeguarding classified information was specifically identified\nas a key development need for Applicant at her annual performance review for 2004.\n(Ex. A.) In 2005, Applicant was transferred out of document control, a closed area\napproved for open storage of classified material  (Ex. 4.), because of a pattern of\n1\ninadvertent  security violations. The details of those violations follow.\nAs the last employee to leave document control at the end of the work day on\nApril 4, 2001, Applicant signed the sign-out log, and secured the main door by cipher\nand \u201cS&G\u201d locks. But she failed to close and properly secure an overhead roll-up door\nat a service counter in the document control area. She was having problems with her\nson\u2019s father and was \u201cdistracted\u201d when she left for the day. (Tr. 75.) A second-shift\nsecurity guard at the facility discovered the service door unlocked and unattended. He\ngained access to the document control area, and notified a security manager. The\nfollowing morning, the combination to the document control area was changed, and all\nemployees in document control conducted self-inspections of their immediate areas. All\nmaterial appeared to be in proper order. Following its own investigation, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer determined that Applicant was solely responsible for the security violation.\nThe two visitors, who remained in the facility after Applicant left work, had been\n\nOn April 8, 2002, Applicant\u2019s employer established a disciplinary process for violations of the\n2\nNISPOM, which provided for the following levels of disciplinary action.\nExcept where indicated, the following is a guideline for use in determining what to\nrecommend as appropriate discipline. It is not necessarily a set standard to be followed in all\ncases and will vary depending upon the severity and circumstances of the violation.\n \nA. Non-Deliberate Breach of Security\nMinimum Security Action\n     W ithin One Year Period\nFirst\nW ritten W arning\nSecond\nFive Day Suspension W ithout Pay\nThird\nTen Day Suspension W ithout Pay\nUp to and Including Termination\nB. In case of deliberate breaches of security, the minimum disciplinary action is a five day\nsuspension without pay and circumstances may warrant recommendation of termination.\n4\nescorted until they departed, but the company\u2019s security manager concluded that\ncompromise of classified information could not be precluded. The document control\narea was vulnerable for more than four hours until it was secured by the second-shift\nguard. Applicant apologized to her employer for her negligence in failing to secure the\nwindow. Since it was her first known violation, she was counseled by her supervisor\nabout the importance of being extremely diligent in securing closed areas. A letter\nverifying that she had been verbally reprimanded was placed in her personnel file.\nWarning and sign-out forms were posted to remind the last person leaving document\ncontrol to secure the window. The DSS industrial security representative with cognizant\nauthority over the facility concluded there had been no loss, compromise, or suspected\ncompromise of classified material, and that corrective actions by Applicant\u2019s employer\nwere adequate. (Ex. 1, 9.)\nOn October 10, 2002, Applicant received a secret-level classified document that\nhad been hand-carried into the facility. The document was logged into document\ncontrol\u2019s accountability system. The next afternoon, the document was discovered\nmissing when the intended recipient came to retrieve it. Searches of classified\ncontainers and the document control area failed to turn up the document. On October\n14, 2002, steps were taken to search and then secure a dumpster at the facility in case\nthe document had fallen into a trash can next to Applicant\u2019s desk and collected with\nother trash on October 11, 2002. The dumpster remained under visual monitoring or\nwas secured before, during, and after its removal to a refuse facility on October 16,\n2002, when Applicant sifted through the refuse and found the document intact but\nsoiled. The facility security officer (FSO) determined that the document had been left\nvulnerable to compromise for six days. Applicant was found primarily responsible, as\nthe classified document was believed to have been inadvertently knocked into the trash\ncan next to her desk, from which it was then deposited into a large hamper and finally\nthe dumpster. She had failed to place the document on the shelf where it belonged and\nleft it on her desk. Corrective actions taken included removing individual trash cans in\ndocument control. Applicant was issued a written reprimand under company policy\npertinent to first non-deliberate security infractions within a 12-month period.  (Ex. 2, 9.)\n2\n\nC. A history of any prior security violations will also be considered in determining disciplinary\naction. (Ex. 7.)\nDisciplinary records for the June 2005 incident indicate that Applicant received a one-day suspension\n3\nfor failure to properly secure a closed area in April 2004. (Ex. 5.) The written reprimand and security violation\nreport on the April 2004 incident indicate that Applicant received verbal counseling and a written reprimand.\nThe evidence is consistent about her one-day suspension for the  September 2004 security violation, however.\n(Ex. 3.) \n5\nApplicant was the last employee to leave the document control area on April 7,\n2004. Security personnel subsequently discovered the door to the secret-level closed\narea to be closed but not properly secured. The spin-dial lock was not in the proper\nposition to secure the closed area. Applicant had rushed to pick up her young son by a\ncertain time. (Tr. 76.) Applicant admitted to her employer that she had been distracted\non exiting the facility, and she failed to engage the lock. Because the closed area had a\nsupplemental locking device, only cleared personnel could gain access, and the door\nshowed no signs of tampering, the facility FSO determined classified information was\nnot compromised. Applicant was reminded of the proper procedures for securing a\nclosed area, and was issued a written reprimand.  (Ex. 3, 5, 9, 76.)\n3\nIn May 2004, Applicant was transferred to document control duties at another\nfacility when her former work site closed. (Ex. 9, A, B.) While making his security rounds\non September 15, 2004, a company security guard found a lock open (had not been\nspun) to the document control area, but the alarm was set. Sign-out logs reflected that\nApplicant had been the last employee to leave the closed area, although she and a\ncoworker had left at the same time.  When interviewed by company security personnel\nduring its investigation, Applicant indicated that she had checked the door and it would\nnot open. She set the door/area alarm according to the written directions provided, and\nonce the security light was on, she assumed the door was locked. Security personnel\nnoticed that the procedures for opening and securing a closed area were on the back\nside of the sign-in/out log. As a result of the incident, the procedures to secure the\nclosed area were posted on the inside of the door, and Applicant and her coworker were\ninstructed to spin the dial to engage the locking mechanism. The FSO determined that\ncompromise of classified information did not occur, since the area was found alarmed,\nthe badge-reader system was engaged, and no one had entered the closed area\nbetween the time Applicant left and the security guard found the lock open. Because it\nwas Applicant\u2019s second non-deliberate violation within the year, she was suspended\none day from work, and a copy of the security violation report was placed in her security\nfile. Applicant was warned that any further violations could result in discipline up to and\nincluding termination. (Ex. 4, 9.)\nOn June 23, 2005, the document control area was found unsecured and\nunattended during a routine, after-hours security check by a company security guard.\nThe spin-dial primary locking device had not been secured. Applicant had been the last\nperson to log out that day, and when interviewed by the assistant FSO, she admitted\nthat she had forgotten to spin the combination lock. No classified material was lost or\nunaccounted for. Compromise of classified information up to the secret-level could not\nbe ruled out, although it was considered remote. Applicant was reminded of her\n\n6\nresponsibilities to properly secure a closed area and to safeguard classified information.\nBecause it was Applicant\u2019s fifth inadvertent security violation within the last four years,\nand \u201cgiven that the protection of classified material [was] the very basis of [Applicant\u2019s]\nassignment,\u201d she was suspended from work without pay for three days, and issued a\nformal notice of security/company violation by her employer. (Ex. 5, Tr. 81.)\nIn October 2005, after reviewing the company\u2019s administrative inquiry of the June\n2005 security incident, the DSS requested from Applicant\u2019s employer an adverse\ninformation report on Applicant based on her \u201cdefinite pattern of negligence in the\nhandling of classified material.\u201d (Ex. 5.) Applicant was reassigned from document\ncontrol duties around November 2005, where she was no longer tasked with locking a\nsecure area. (Ex. 9.) On December 9, 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer notified the DSS that\nApplicant had been reassigned to a position in the security office where her\nperformance and work assignments could be closely monitored. (Ex. 5, 9.) Applicant\u2019s\nviolation was addressed in her annual performance evaluation for 2005, but her\nsupervisor was confident that it would not recur. (Ex. A.)\nApplicant attributes her security violations to \u201csituations\u201d rather than to a lack of\nsecurity training. (Tr. 80.) Events at home were upsetting to her, and she had to pick up\nher son at a set time. (Tr. 82.) Since her position transfer in late 2005, Applicant\u2019s duties\nin security have focused on security education (keeping track of employees\u2019 security\nbriefings, maintaining security posters, noting security education in a notebook for DSS,\nrunning security awareness week at her previous job location), processing visit\nrequests, and issuing badges. (Ex. A, Tr. 65-66, 104-06.) She has had limited access to\nclassified information since late 2005,  \u201cmaybe three times\u201d involving bringing classified\nmaterial to document control for destruction. (Tr. 79.) She requires a security clearance\nin her present job to access a clearance verification system, and for access to a closed\narea. (Tr. 106-07.)\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant tried marijuana out of curiosity when the illegal drug was passed to her\nin a social setting in 1974. She continued to smoke the drug in similar circumstances up\nto twice weekly and then up to twice monthly, until 1993. (Ex. 11.) She continued to\nsmoke the drug after going to work for her current employer as a document control clerk\nwith a secret-level security clearance granted to her in September 1984. (Ex. 10.)\nApplicant stopped using the drug in mid-1995. (Ex. 14.)\nApplicant used cocaine in social settings about once a month from 1986 until\n1994. In June 1994, Applicant separated from her now ex-husband. Around that time,\nApplicant began a personal relationship with a person known by her to use both\nmarijuana and cocaine. Applicant\u2019s cocaine use increased to twice monthly, as she\nsmoked the illegal drug with him on occasion. She discontinued using cocaine in mid-\n1995 (\u201cin like May or June,\u201d Tr. 91.) when she became pregnant with their son, who was\nborn in February 1996. In March 1996, Applicant began to attend Narcotics Anonymous\nmeetings on a weekly basis. However, her boyfriend  increased his usage of cocaine\n\n7\nand marijuana during her pregnancy, and began to blame her for his drug usage.\nApplicant left him in May 2007, and she and her son moved in with her sister. (Ex. 11.)\nIn May 1997, Applicant applied for a top-secret security clearance. (Ex. 13). She\nexecuted a security clearance application (EPSQ) on which she responded \u201cNo\u201d to the\nillegal drug inquiries, including question 27 concerning whether she had illegally used\nany controlled substance in the last seven years, and question 28 concerning whether\nshe had ever illegally used a controlled substance in a sensitive position, including while\npossessing a security clearance. (Ex. 10.)\n In July 1997, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent, in part about\nher illegal drug use. Applicant provided details of her marijuana use from 1974 to 1993,\nand of her cocaine use from 1986 until her pregnancy. She added that she was\nattending Narcotics Anonymous on a weekly basis and had been receiving mental\nhealth counseling. She told the investigator that she had knowingly falsified her EPSQ\nby omitting her drug use, her cohabitation with her former boyfriend, as well as her\ncounseling, because she feared disclosure would adversely affect her security\nclearance. (Ex. 11.) She initially testified at her hearing that her negative response to\nthe drug use question was \u201cjust an honest mistake. I think I was thinking of going back\nthe seven years.\u201d (Tr. 69.) When asked again, she admitted that she falsified her\nsecurity clearance application in 1997 because \u201c[she] was afraid that [she] wasn\u2019t going\nto be able to get a clearance.\u201d (Tr. 70-71.)\nIn late September 1997, Applicant signed and notarized an agreement to abide\nby the DoD policy to not use any narcotic, dangerous drug, or other controlled\nsubstance in any amount in the future. (Es. 12.) In October 1997, Applicant was granted\na top-secret security clearance. (Ex. 13.)\nIn November 2002, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86)\nto update her top-secret security clearance. As she had in May 1997, she answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to both question 27 inquiring into any illegal use of drugs in the last seven years,\nand question 28 about any use of illegal drugs and drug activity while in a sensitive\nposition, including while possessing a security clearance. (Ex. 13.) Applicant\u2019s top-\nsecret security clearance was renewed in February 2003. (Ex. 3.)\nIn October 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a different DSS special agent. In\na signed, sworn statement, Applicant admitted that she had used both marijuana and\ncocaine in the past, but that she was no longer using either illegal drug. In variance to\nher previous disclosure of cocaine use starting in 1986, she reported first involvement\nwith cocaine in 1993. Applicant told this agent that she stopped using cocaine and\nmarijuana in mid-1995 because of her pregnancy. Applicant admitted that she had\npurchased both marijuana and cocaine from friends when she used them, spending\nbetween $25 and $100 per month. Applicant\u2019s statement included the following\nadmission against interest:\nI intentionally omitted my use of cocaine and marijuana from my SCA\nbecause I was concerned that I would not get a security clearance if I\n\n8\nlisted them. I now recognize the importance of being honest and I have\nattempted to provide all relevant information concerning my past drug use.\n(Ex. 14.) Applicant now maintains that she did not deliberately falsify her November\n2002 SF 86. Rather, she testified that she was referring to her 1997 application (which\nshe maintains the investigator had with him) when asked why she had not disclosed her\ndrug use. (Tr. 87) Applicant attributed her negative response to the drug inquiries to the\nfact that she had not used any illegal drugs in the seven years preceding her\napplication. (Tr. 71-73, 88.)\nIn the latest update of her security clearance, Applicant executed an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on August 18, 2008. She\nresponded negatively to the drug inquiries, including question 24.b, \u201cHave you ever\nillegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer,\nprosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a\nposition directly and immediately affecting public safety?\u201d (Ex. 8.) During an October\n2008 interview (Ex. 9) and at her hearing, she was not asked about, and did not offer,\nan explanation for her apparently false response to question 24.b. Her May 1997 EPSQ\nindicates that she was granted a secret-level security clearance in 1984. She smoked\nmarijuana from about 1974 to June 1995, and used cocaine from 1986 to June 1995.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations from 2003 through 2005 show that she met\nher employer\u2019s expectations, although additional security training was identified as a key\ndevelopment need that had not been fully met by the time of her transfer to a senior\nadministrative associate position. Applicant met or exceeded her employer\u2019s\nexpectations in her new role, with her strong customer service orientation and \u201cpositive\npeople skills\u201d leading to continued progress in that area within the operations security\nteam in 2006 in 2007. A strong team player, she demonstrated initiative and willingness\nto accept new tasks. Key development needs were still in the area of security education,\nwhere she was advised at her annual performance evaluations for 2006 through 2008 to\nexpand her knowledge of the security office and security responsibilities. (Ex. A.)\nA senior site security specialist, who worked with Applicant in document control\nfrom 1990 until Applicant was transferred in 2005, attests to Applicant\u2019s good work\nethic, her professionalism, courtesy, and willingness to help others. She is aware that\nApplicant committed a couple of inadvertent security violations and is of the opinion that\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance should be continued. (Ex. B, Tr. 45-46.) The former\nmanager of the document control office indicates that Applicant was a dedicated and\nindustrious worker. This former supervisor is aware that Applicant had a \u201ccouple of\nviolations over the years [which] were unintentional and were taken very seriously by\nher.\u201d She has no concern about recommending Applicant for a clearance. (Ex. C.) An\ninformation systems security manager, who has known Applicant since May 2005, had\ndaily contact with her, including on occasion retrieving or storing classified information\nwithin document control. In his opinion, Applicant displayed competency and a\nprofessional demeanor. (Ex. D.) Applicant also has the support of the security manager\n\n9\nwho disciplined Applicant for the June 2005 violation. (Ex. 5, E.) She continued to be\nfamiliar with Applicant\u2019s work performance until April 2009, and found Applicant to be an\n\u201chonest, sincere, and hardworking employee.\u201d This security manager also recommends\nApplicant for a position of trust, based on Applicant\u2019s improved duty performance, her\ncommitment to security, and her integrity. (Ex. E.) Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor in\ndocument control, for all but a couple of years from 1994 until 2002 (Tr. 61-62.),\nunderstands that the Government is concerned about \u201csome inconsistencies\u201d in\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application, and of Applicant\u2019s failure to secure a \u201cmetal\ngate\u201d so that document control was left open. He feels that Applicant made an\nunintentional mistake that she is not likely to repeat. (Tr. 54-55.) He would consider any\nmistake on her security clearance application to be unintentional based on what he\nknows about her. He has never seen her under the influence of illegal drugs. (Tr. 56-\n57.)\nA close personal friend of Applicant\u2019s for some 47 years knows that Applicant\nused illegal drugs in the past. She believes Applicant stopped using illegal drugs 20\nyears ago. She considers Applicant to be of upstanding character. (Tr. 37-40.)\nApplicant has been the sole financial supporter for her son since his birth. (Tr.\n67.) She and her son live with her sister. (Tr. 77.)\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\n\nThe SOR alleges Applicant violated \u00b6\u00b6 5-300 and 5-303 of the NISPOM when she failed to properly\n4\nsecure the document control area, a closed area approved for open storage of classified material up to the\nsecret level. NISPOM \u00b6 5-300 is a general provision that requires contractors, such as Applicant\u2019s employer,\nto meet the requirements for the physical protection of classified material in its custody. NISPOM \u00b6 5-303 sets\nforth the specifics for approved storage of secret material. NISPOM \u00b6 5-306 applies to closed areas.\n10\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nHandling Protected Information\nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in Guideline K,\nAG \u00b6 33:\nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability\nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\nApplicant committed five separate security violations between April 2001 and\nJune 2005 while employed as a classified document control clerk within a closed area\ncleared to store material to the level of secret. Applicant violated the NISPOM and her\nemployer\u2019s requirements concerning the proper storage of classified material by failing\nto properly secure the document control area on four occasions, and in October 2002,\nby failing to protect a secret-level classified document that had been hand-carried into\nthe facility. In addition to her general responsibility as a cleared employee to safeguard\nclassified information entrusted to her (see NISPOM, \u00b6 5-100), Applicant was entrusted\nwith the responsibility to secure a closed area.  By not securing the document control\n4\nwindow in June 2001, and by failing to engage locking mechanisms in April 2004,\n\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant left a document control window open in September 2004 (SOR 1.d).\n5\nThe company\u2019s administrative inquiry shows that Applicant failed to spin a lock to the document control area\non that occasion. (Ex.4)\n11\nSeptember 2004,  and June 2005, Applicant left the document control area vulnerable\n5\nto unauthorized access. Under NISPOM \u00b6 5-306, access to closed areas must be\ncontrolled to preclude unauthorized access. Her negligent handling of the classified\ndocument entrusted to her in October 2002 led to its inadvertent removal from the\nfacility to a waste site where it was eventually recovered intact but soiled. Compromise\nof the secret-level document was considered unlikely, but it could not be precluded\nbecause the document was not appropriately secured for six days. AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany\nfailure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information,\u201d\napplies. After the April 2004 incident, Applicant was reminded of her responsibility to\nspin the locking device when she left for the evening. Twice thereafter at her new\nfacility, she failed to engage the spin lock on the door to document control. So AG \u00b6\n34(h), \u201cnegligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by\nmanagement,\u201d also applies.\nApplicant\u2019s negligence led to a classified document being improperly stored in a\ntrash dumpster for several days in October 2002, but she did not knowingly store the\nclassified information in an unauthorized location. AG \u00b6 34(b), \u201ccollecting or storing\nclassified or other protected information at home or in any other unauthorized location,\u201d\nis not pertinent. Furthermore, AG \u00b6 34(a), \u201cdeliberate or negligent disclosure of\nclassified or other protected information to unauthorized persons, including but not\nlimited to personal or business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at\nseminars, meetings, or conferences,\u201d does not squarely apply because there is no proof\nof unauthorized disclosure.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 35(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior,\nor it happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d applies in part in that her latest security violation occurred more than\nfour years ago. But the passage of time provides insufficient guarantee against\nrecurrence, especially when she has been called on only three times to handle\nclassified information since November 2005, and none of these occasions involved\nsecuring a closed area.\nEven with limited opportunity to prove compliance with security regulations,\nreform may be established under AG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe individual responded favorably to\ncounseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude\ntoward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d Applicant admitted her carelessness,\nwhich is a vital first step in reform. Yet, despite being reminded by her supervisor to give\nher full attention to the security task at hand and to exercise extreme diligence in\nsecuring her work area, she committed similar violations in April 2004, September 2004,\nand June 2005. It is difficult to find under these circumstances that she responded\nfavorably to counseling, even though she displayed a positive attitude and willingness to\ncomply with her security responsibilities. As of the date of her performance evaluation\n\n12\nfor 2004, she had not completed the DSS security correspondence courses\nrecommended by her supervisor for the second straight year. One would have expected\nApplicant to have sought security training or re-education to allay her employer\u2019s and\nDSS\u2019 concerns about her security practices and there is no evidence that she did so.\n(See Tr. 81.) When asked about the recurring nature of her violations, Applicant testified\nthat she tried to be more conscious about closing up document control, but that \u201cthings\nwere going on at home that were very upsetting to [her].\u201d (Tr. 82.)\nFollowing her fifth inadvertent violation in four years, Applicant was suspended\nfor three days without pay by her employer. After the DSS expressed concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of negligence, Applicant was reassigned by her employer to a\nposition in security where her work performance and work assignments could be closely\nmonitored. While she provided key support in several areas, including maintaining\nsecurity education logs and bulletins, key development needs continued to be\nexpanding her knowledge of the security office\u2019s functions and her security\nresponsibilities. (Ex. A.)\nThat said, Applicant does not contend, and there is no evidence to indicate that\nthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. AG \u00b6 35(c), \u201cthe\nsecurity violations were due to improper or inadequate training,\u201d is not pertinent. None\nof the mitigating conditions fully apply.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant abused marijuana and cocaine while she held a security clearance and\nworked in document control routinely handling classified documents. She used\nmarijuana for some 20 years, from 1974 to around June 1995, and cocaine from 1986\nuntil June 1995. Yet, when applying for a clearance upgrade to top secret in May 1997,\nshe falsely denied that she had used any illegal drugs in the last seven years and that\nshe had ever used an illegal controlled substance while possessing a security\nclearance. Applicant omitted her drug use because she feared that she would be denied\na security clearance. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances\n6\nin which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered:\n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation,\nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated\nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive\nSection 6.3.\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR misconduct for the five above purposes, and not for any other\npurpose.\n13\nApplicant also responded negatively to the inquiries about illegal drugs when she\ncompleted her SF 86 in November 2002, five years after she had detailed her illegal\ndrug involvement to a DSS agent in July 1997. Applicant had told a government\ninvestigator in October 2003 that she intentionally omitted her past illicit drug\ninvolvement as she was concerned she would not obtain a security clearance. I am not\npersuaded by her hearing testimony that this admission against interest was made in\nreference to her May 1997 EPSQ. There is nothing in her sworn statement of October\n2003 (Ex. 14.) that shows the May 1997 EPSQ was discussed. When asked about her\ncounseling in October 2003, Applicant responded, \u201cAs I indicated on my SCA, I have\nreceived counseling.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the counseling inquiry on her May\n1997 EPSQ (Ex. 10.), while she had responded affirmatively to similar inquiry on her\nNovember 2002 SF 86. (Ex. 13.) The evidence strongly suggests that the November\n2002 SF 86 provided the basis for the interview in October 2003. That said, since there\nwas no evidence of any illegal drug use by Applicant after June 1995, her response to\nquestion 27 on the November 2002 SF 86 was not shown to be false. But her answer to\nquestion 28 concerning any illegal drug use ever while possessing a security clearance\nwas not true. Because the Government did not allege falsification of question 28, it\ncannot provide an independent basis for denial of her clearance. However, it is relevant\nin assessing the extent of her reform of her intentional false statement on her May 1997\nEPSQ alleged in SOR  2.a.6\nApplicant provided a detailed history of her illegal drug involvement when she\nwas interviewed by a DSS agent in July 1997. This effort at rectification was sufficiently\ntimely to qualify as a prompt effort to correct a May 1997 deliberate misrepresentation.\nYet, it is unclear whether she volunteered the information up-front. Her disclosures\nappear to have been in response to questions by the investigators during all of her\ninterviews, including in July 1997. Furthermore, given her false responses on both the\nNovember 2002 SF 86 (question 28) and her August 2008 e-QIP (question 24.b) to\nwhether she had ever used any illegal drug while possessing a security clearance, she\nundermines her evidence in reform. Furthermore, although not alleged in the SOR,\nthere is discrepant information in the record about her first use of cocaine. She told a\nDSS agent in July 1997 that she used cocaine beginning in 1986. In October 2003, she\ntold a different agent that she tried cocaine while at a party \u201csometime in about 1993.\u201d\nApplicant made no effort to explain this discrepancy.\n\n14\nApplicant\u2019s May 1997 falsification is now sufficiently dated to satisfy the passage\nof time component of AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed,\nor the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\u201d Yet, intentional falsifications on security clearance applications are\nnot minor offenses. The Government justifiably requires full candor from its applicants\nfor security clearance. Applicant\u2019s security clearance was upgraded to top-secret in\n1997, and there is no indication that the Government knew at the time that she had\nused illegal drugs in the recent past. Nor am I able to conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nmisrepresentations are safely in the past. In October 2003, she told the agent that she\nunderstood the importance of being fully honest. Yet, when she completed her latest\nsecurity clearance application in August 2008, she responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether she had\never used any illegal drug while possessing a security clearance. Her previous\ndisclosures about her drug involvement to the DSS agent did not relieve her of her\nfiduciary obligation to admit on her August 2008 e-QIP that she had used illegal drugs\nwhile possessing a security clearance. She presented no reasonable explanation that\ncould excuse her false responses to question 28 on her November 2002 SF 86 and\nquestion 24.b on her August 2008 e-QIP. Her evidence in reform falls short of satisfying\nAG \u00b6 17(c) or AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant had problems focusing on her security obligations when pressed for\ntime or distracted by problems at home. Disciplinary action and re-education failed to\nprevent Applicant from committing three security violations between April 2004 and\nJune 2005. Given her limited opportunities to handle classified information in her\n\nSOR 1.f alleges only the disciplinary action taken as a result of the security violations in SOR 1.a\n7\nthrough 1.e and does not represent additional conduct of security concern committed by Applicant.\n15\npresent position, one has to look to her overall duty performance for evidence of reform.\nShe has met her employer\u2019s expectations, as shown by her annual performance\nreviews. Applicant is recommended for a position of trust by several coworkers,\nincluding her former security manager, who reportedly witnessed an improvement in\nApplicant\u2019s duty performance and commitment to security since the security violations.\nAt the same time, Applicant\u2019s concealment of her drug use from her May 1997\nEPSQ, and more recently, her false answers to question 28 on her November 2002 SF\n86 and 24.b on her August 2008 e-QIP, are difficult to reconcile with the character\nwitness evidence of her personal integrity and trustworthiness. A former supervisor of\nApplicant\u2019s felt that if Applicant omitted information from her SF 86, it was a mistake and\nnot intentional. (Tr. 56.) Applicant does not dispute that she intentionally concealed her\nillegal drug involvement from her May 1997 EPSQ. The evidence shows she has not\nbeen completely up-front with her character witnesses about her past illicit drug use or\nher efforts to conceal her drug abuse from the Government. Reform is not demonstrated\nby looking to her problems at home to excuse her repeated security violations (see Tr.\n82), or by responding \u201cNo\u201d on her latest e-QIP to whether she had ever used any illegal\ndrug while in a sensitive position. Given the recurring nature of her security violations,\nand the concerns about her judgment and trustworthiness because of her lack of full\ncandor, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant7\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n16\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After \nan investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nAugust 28, 2009, to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 31, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 9, 2009, admitting the four allegations \nunder Guideline F with explanation. Initially, Applicant requested a decision on the \nwritten record. Subsequently after talking to Department Counsel, Applicant requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. (Court Exhibit I, Request, dated January 7, \n2010) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 13, 2010, and the \ncase was assigned to me the next day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 27, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n27, 2010, scheduling a hearing for March 12, 2010. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled.

I \nincluded Applicant's explanation in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \npleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, and has worked as a software engineer in the defense \nindustry for over 21 years. Most of her employment was with one defense contractor. \nShe is a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering awarded in \n1989, and a master's degree in computer science awarded in 2004. She has held a \nsecurity clearance for over 21 years. She married in 1993, and has two children ages \nten and fourteen. Applicant's yearly salary is approximately $94,000. Her husband's \nyearly salary as a health care business analyst has fluctuated but is now approximately \n$48,000, for a yearly family income of $142,000. Applicant and her husband estimate \ntheir monthly discretionary funds are approximately $700. (Tr. 11-19, 51-57; Gov. Ex. 1, \nSF 86, dated august 20, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Statement, dated October 23, 2003)  \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 6, Credit report, dated September 20, 2008; and Gov. \nEx. 7, Credit report, dated July 8, 2009) show the following delinquent debts for \nApplicant: a charge off loan for $9,142 (SOR 1.a); a charged off credit card account for \n$8,726 (SOR 1.b); a collection account on a credit card for $1,354 (SOR 1.c); and a \nmortgage debt past due more than 120 days on a balance of $382,000 (SOR 1.d). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.d concerns Applicant's mortgage. Applicant and \nher husband had good credit history until they purchased a house in 2005 and \nencountered mortgage administration and payment problems. The couple purchased a \nlot in a subdivision and had a house built on it starting in 2005. The house was financed \nby a mortgage. The initial mortgage payments included only principle and interest and \nnot taxes since the house was new and the amount of tax on the house was unknown. \nApplicant and her husband were advised to anticipate the property taxes to be \napproximately $6,000. In March 2006, they received the annual tax assessment which \nwas lower, since they only paid property tax for an unimproved lot for part of the tax \nyears. They paid the bill since they had been keeping funds aside for that purpose. \nThey continued to keep funds aside in 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nTheir mortgage company, in keeping with the common business practice, sold \nthe mortgage to another mortgage company who in turn sold it again to another \nmortgage company. In March 2007, when the property taxes became due, the new \nmortgage company paid the property tax without notifying Applicant. When Applicant's \nhusband called the tax office to pay the 2007 property tax assessment, he was informed \nthat the mortgage company had already paid the property tax. Applicant's husband \nimmediately called the mortgage company, offering to reimburse them for the 2007 \ntaxes. Instead the mortgage company informed him that they would amortize the \npayments over the next year. The mortgage company also increased their payments to \nreflect the anticipated following year's tax assessment. Their monthly payments \nincreased almost $2,000. Applicant and her husband paid $4,791.40, as requested by \nthe mortgage company, from March 2007 until March 2008. In March 2008, the monthly \nmortgage payment dropped to approximately $2,798. Applicant has paid the monthly \nmortgage on time each month in the amount requested by the mortgage company. \nHowever because of the tax payment issue, the mortgage company reported that the \nmortgage was past due in some amount. Applicant and her husband requested a \nmortgage loan modification which has been approved by the mortgage company. This \nwill further lower their monthly mortgage payments. (Tr. 32-66; App. Ex. G, Bank \nStatements from March 2008 until February 2010; App. Ex. G, Mortgage Account \nStatement, dated August 29, 2008; App. Ex. I, Loan Modification, dated October 27, \n2009) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a is for a loan of $7,000 that with interest and fees \nis now for $9,142. Applicant and her husband used the loan to pay living expenses \nwhen the mortgage payments were in dispute and the payments increased by over \n$2,000. Applicant received a settlement offer from the loan company for $5,443.70. \nHowever, Applicant is paying the loan by automatic direct deposit at the rate of $400 per \nmonth. Applicant has paid over $1,300 from December 2009 until the hearing in March \n2010. (Tr. 21-26; App. Ex. A, Settlement offer, dated December 224, 2009; App. Ex B, \nC, D, Bank Statements January, February, March 2010)  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.b is for a credit card Applicant and her husband \nused to pay living expenses while their mortgage payments were in flux. Applicant \nalready had the credit card with a balance owed when the mortgage issue occurred. \nApplicant is making $300 monthly automatic direct deposit payments on this account. \n(Tr. 21-26; App. Ex. M, Bank Statement, dated March 24, 2010)   \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c is for a credit card. The debt was paid in full in \nOctober 2009. (Answer to SOR, Letter, dated October 29, 2009) \n \nApplicant has received special awards for her exceptional performance with the \ndefense contractor. (App. Ex. F, Certificate, dated December 15, 2006) Her \nperformance ratings show that she meets or exceed expectations for her job \nperformance. (App. Ex. K, Rating, May 2008, June 2009; App. Ex. L, Performance \nrating, January 2003 to December 2003) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as reported in credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant incurred delinquent \ndebts when her mortgage was miscalculated and she and her husband used credit \ncards and a loan to pay living expenses.  \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). The mitigating conditions apply. Applicant's delinquent debts \noccurred when her mortgage company paid the property tax on the property \nunbeknownst to Applicant and then doubled her mortgage payments. Applicant and her \nhusband continued to make their monthly mortgage payments as requested by the \nmortgage company. They set aside funds for property taxes as recommended by the \nmortgage company. Applicant had to use credit cards and a loan to meet their living \nexpenses. The mortgage problem occurred under very unusual circumstances and was \nbeyond Applicant's control. She acted reasonably by having the mortgage modified, and \ntimely making her mortgage payments as requested by the mortgage company. She \npaid one of the debts incurred to meet living expenses and has payments plan for the \ntwo remaining debts.  \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful \ntrack record\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments \n\n \n6 \n \n \nor reduction of debt through payment of debts. An applicant is not required to establish \nthat she paid each and every debt listed. The entirety of an Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and her actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which \nthat Applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. There is no \nrequirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually \npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. All that is \nrequired is that Applicant demonstrates she has established a plan to resolve her \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant's financial problems were caused by a condition beyond her control. \nShe and her husband paid their mortgage and set aside funds to pay the property taxes. \nThe mortgage company without notice to Applicant paid the property tax increasing her \nmortgage payments. She used credit cards and a loan to pay their normal living \nexpenses. She is current with her mortgage and has entered a loan modification to keep \npayments within her limits. She paid one loan in full and is making monthly automatic \npayments on the other two loans. Applicant's actions paying and resolving her \ndelinquent debts is significant and credible information to establish a meaning track \nrecord of debt payment, and shows that she acted reasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant is a \nhighly regarded employee with excellent performance ratings. She held a security \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclearance for over 21 years with no security issues. Her record shows she is \ntrustworthy, reliable, honest, competent, capable, and exercises good judgment.  \n \nApplicant established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. Applicant presented \nsufficient information to show she is taking reasonable and responsible action to resolve \nher financial issues. Her mortgage issues, which started her financial problems, were \ncaused by her mortgage company and not by her. She is current with her mortgage and \nhas the ability to make her mortgage payments. She paid one of her other debts and \nhas payment plans and is paying her two remaining debts. Applicant's management of \nher finances and payment of past obligations indicates she will be concerned, \nresponsible, and careful regarding classified information. Applicant mitigated security \nconcerns based on her finances. Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated security concerns \narising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He stated \nthat he rushed through the application while giving the most accurate answers possible. \n                                                          \n1 Item 6. \n \n2 Items 4-6; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Item 6. \n\n \n3 \n \nHe listed the marijuana use because it was by far his most prevalent use. He stated that \nif he intended to mislead the government he \u201cwould have left out everything including \nthe marijuana usage.\u201d Applicant also listed adverse criminal information under another \nquestion.5 After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant did not intentionally \nprovide incomplete answers to Question 24a. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana after he submitted his SF 86. He moved to the state of \nhis current residence in October 2008. He smoked marijuana with his brother the \nweekend before he moved.6  \n \n \nApplicant revealed his full drug use when he was interviewed for his background \ninvestigation in November 2008. He told the investigator that he had no plans to quit \nusing marijuana unless he had to. He stated that he stopped using painkillers \nrecreationally because he ran out of them. He stated that he would use them again in \nthe future if he had them. He stated that he would also stop using marijuana if it started \naffecting any other aspect of his life.7  \n \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR in October 2009, he stated \u201cI intend to \nquit [marijuana and painkillers] if I have to. I now have to for clearance. I will quit.\u201d \nApplicant clarified his position in his response to the FORM. He stated that the people \nhe met when he moved to his current location are not drug users. He stated: \n \nThough during the investigation I did not say that I intended to quit, in the \nyear and a half I have been in a professional environment I have been led \nto understand that in order to thrive in a drug-free environment, I must give \nup my \u201cparty days\u201d and become a responsible member of the environment \nI have become a part of. Not just for my clearance, but to succeed in an \natmosphere that is unforgiving of someone under the influence of an \nunclear mind.8   \n \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after Applicant moved and started his new \njob in October 2008. Applicant\u2019s friends and some of his family members are aware of \nhis drug use.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n                                                          \n5 Items 4-6; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n6 Items 4, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n9 Item 4; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n\n \n4 \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;10  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of marijuana, illegal mushrooms, and \nprescription drugs for recreational purposes are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) \nas disqualifying conditions. He told a background investigator in November 2008 that he \nhad no plans to quit using marijuana unless he had to, and that he might use painkillers \nagain. Those statements generated security concerns under AG \u00b6 25(h).  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana regularly in college. He also used illegal mushrooms on \ntwo occasions and prescription drugs for recreational purposes on about ten occasions. \nHe continued to periodically use marijuana after college, including on at least one \noccasion after he submitted his SF 86 in September 2008. He moved to another state \n                                                          \n10 Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction.  \n\n \n6 \n \nand started his current job in October 2008. He told the investigator in November 2008 \nthat he had no plans to quit using marijuana unless he had to, and that he would use \npainkillers recreationally in the future if he had them. When he responded to the SOR in \nOctober 2009, he stated he intended to quit marijuana and painkillers because he had \nto for his clearance. He further clarified that position when he responded to the FORM. \nThe people he knows at his current location do not use drugs, and there is no evidence \nof any illegal drug use after October 2008.  \n \nThere is no bright-line rule as to whether conduct is recent. However, Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use was extensive, occurred over several years, happened on at least one \noccasion after he submitted his SF 86, and he did not commit to being drug free until \nrecently, and then because he \u201chad to.\u201d Because Applicant elected not to have a \nhearing, I was unable to ask additional questions or assess his credibility. Based upon \nthe limited information in the record, I am unable to find that Applicant\u2019s drug use is \nunlikely to recur. His drug use continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not applicable. Applicant has stated that he does not \nintend to abuse drugs in the future, but he does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(b) for the same rationale discussed above. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \n\n \n7 \n \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted incomplete information on his SF 86, but as discussed \nabove, it was not intentional. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a is concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nApplicant provided false information about his drug use on his employment \napplication for a department store in 2005. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b) and 16(e) are applicable as \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana after he submitted his SF 86 in September 2008. That \nconduct created a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his employment application was five years ago. He has \nnot worked for the company for three years. He revealed his drug use during his \nbackground interview. There is no evidence of any illegal drug use after October 2008. \n\n \n8 \n \nFriends and family members are aware of his drug use. He has taken positive steps to \nreduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is \napplicable. Personal Conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 24 years old. He regularly used illegal drugs while in college. He \ncontinued smoking marijuana after college, including on at least one occasion after he \nsubmitted his SF 86. He did not commit to being drug free until he saw it as a \nrequirement for holding his clearance. Based upon the limited information available in \nthe record, concerns remain about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Personal Conduct security concerns, but he has not \nmitigated Drug Involvement concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.e-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

(Government Exhibit 1).  On March 11, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 24, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on April 13, 2009.  A notice of hearing was initially issued on April\n21, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 12, 2009.  The matter was continued based\nupon the fact that the Applicant failed to receive the notice of hearing.  An amended\nnotice of hearing was issued on May 12, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 15,\n2009.  At the hearing, the Government offered seven exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant\noffered nine exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, that were admitted into\nevidence.  She also testified on his own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was\n\n2\nreceived on May 27, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nher testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 51 years old and has a Bachelors\nDegree in Business.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Purchasing\nRepresentative and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant has a twenty-four year work history with her employer.  She\nexplained that after high school, beginning in 1977, she worked for the police\ndepartment where she met her husband.  They were married in 1982.  Her husband,\nwho was fifteen years older, retired from the police department, did not work\nconsistently, and acquired a serious drinking problem.  In August 1984, the Applicant\nhad a baby and wanted him to stop drinking, but he would not.  The Applicant had run\nout of savings and her income from her job at a bank was insufficient to support the\nfamily, which also included paying child support for his two boys from a previous\nmarriage and back taxes he owed.  In an act of desperation, with only her suitcase and\ntheir child in hand, she left the state and moved in with her sister.  She left behind all of\nher possessions.  She got a job, and started sending money to her husband to help pay\nthe bills.  It was not long before she learned that he was not using the money to pay the\nbills.  After two years of consuming alcohol to excess and running up credit card debt,\nher husband lost everything they owned including their home and their cars.  He then\nmoved out of state and in with the Applicant.  By this time, the Applicant wanted a\ndivorce, but was advised by her attorney to file for bankruptcy first.  On February 9,\n1987, the Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and their debt was\ndischarged in July 7, 1987.  (Government Exhibit 4).  Then they filed for divorce.     \nIn 1990, the Applicant remarried and became accustomed to a dual income.  She\nand her second husband were divorced in 1997.  \nIn 2005, the Applicant purchased a home on two and a half acres near her job.  It\nwas a fixer but she was not patient enough to wait to improve it, and started using credit\ncards to pay for repairs.  She then got a second on the house and spent that money.\nShe broke her foot, which caused her to be out of work for seven months.  While on\n\n3\ndisability she was overpaid, and so when she returned to work, her employer was\nreimbursed from her paycheck.  Her weekly check was only $200.00 and she fell even\nfarther behind on her bills.  At the same time, unbeknownst to her, the interest rate on\nher home loan adjusted to 18 percent, a payment that she could not afford.  She tried to\nsell the house, but it was eventually foreclosed upon.  She moved out in November\n2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).    \nOn October 24, 2008, the Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy again.  Her\nliabilities totaled approximately $51,200.00.  (Government Exhibit 3).  A letter from her\nattorney dated October 31, 2008, indicates that the Applicant recently completed a\nseries of consumer/financial  education courses designed to teach her how to properly\nhandle her finances and prevent future financial issues.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  The\nApplicant credibly testified that she now knows where she went wrong.  She overspent,\nlived beyond her means and was a poor financial manager.  She claims that she has\nnow learned how to properly budget her money and pay her bills on time.   \nLetters of recommendation from her coworkers, friends and her pastor, indicate\nthat the Applicant is dependable, hardworking, conscientious, honest, kind and\ncompassionate.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\n\n4\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and.or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d)  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n5\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant has\nmade a good faith effort to resolve her debts.  In 1987, her financial problems were\nlargely beyond her control.  They were caused by her dead beat husband who had no\nconsistent employment, consumed alcohol to excess, created excessive credit card\ndebt and ultimately ended in divorce.  In 2008, the situation was much different, and it\nappears that she has learned from her mistakes.  It is noted that she missed seven\nmonths of work because of her broken foot and that her mortgage payment adjusted to\nan exorbitant amount, but for the most part, her financial problems were caused by a\nseries of poor financial decisions that spiraled out of control.  She understands that\nholding a DoD security clearance is a privilege and that she must always demonstrate\nfinancial responsibility.  To resolve her indebtedness, she hired an attorney and was\nadvised that her only option was bankruptcy.  In 2008, she filed for Chapter 7 again.\nOnce her debts are discharged, she will have a fresh start.  She recently completed\nfinancial counseling classes and has learned how to properly budget her money and\nonly buy necessities.  She should no longer have any problems paying her bills on time\nas she understands the importance of living within ones means.  In the event that she\nhas any future financial problems, her security clearance will immediately be in\njeopardy.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  \n\n6\nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances;\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and.or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control, and 20(d)  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also applies.  The Applicant had initiated a good\nfaith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\n",

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAndrea Reino, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 17, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 3, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Philip S. Howe granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge\u2019s analysis\nand conclusions under Guideline D are arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law; (b) whether the\nJudge\u2019s analysis under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law; and (c) whether the\nJudge\u2019s analysis under the whole-person concept is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.  For\nthe reasons discussed below, the Board remands the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant joined the Navy in April\n2005.  He served three years of active duty until being administratively discharged on January 31,\n2008, with an honorable discharge.  During his Navy service, Applicant had a security clearance.\nNo violations of security procedures or regulations were committed by Applicant while he held the\nclearance.  Applicant had some personality conflicts with other service people while on active duty.\nHe attributed the conflicts to judgments people made about his poor economic background and his\nbisexual interests.  Applicant was involved in three incidents involving other service people and\nalcohol.  These involved assaults.  After one of the incidents, Applicant informed his command that\nhe was assaulted because he was gay.  Because of this admission, his commander began processing\nhim for administrative separation.  About two months later, in June 2007, Applicant attended a party\nwhere everyone drank alcohol, and it was Applicant\u2019s impression that everyone was intoxicated.\nApplicant drank to excess, claimed he later blacked out, and does not remember making any sexual\nor improper advances toward any woman or man during the party.  Applicant asserted that one\nfriend at the party wanted him to engage in three-way sex with him and the friend\u2019s girlfriend.  The\nfriend and his girlfriend deny that this request occurred.  While at the party, Applicant was alleged\nto have groped his friend\u2019s girlfriend while seeking sex from her, to have put his hands down the\npants of another male party-goer, and to have later performed fellatio on his friend who invited him\nto the party.  Thereafter, a Navy investigation occurred that resulted in court-martial charges and an\nArticle 32 investigation.  Applicant was accused of sodomy, assault, and indecent assault under the\nUCMJ.  The charges were withdrawn when Applicant accepted the administrative discharge.\nApplicant no longer consumes alcohol.  He works for his defense contractor, attends college classes,\nand goes to his synagogue.  Since March 2008, he has attended counseling to help him understand\nhis life and interests.  Applicant did not disclose on his SF-86 the circumstances under which he left\nthe Navy.  He did disclose that he left a civilian job in August 2003 by mutual agreement after\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance.\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: Under Guideline D, Applicant\u2019s sexual acts\nin June 2007 at a party with friends were of a criminal nature; showed a pattern of compulsive\nsexual acts on that occasion; made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress; and showed\na serious lack of discretion and judgment.  Applicant\u2019s actions occurred three years ago while he was\n\n1\u201c[T]he sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d\n3\nin the Navy.  He studies, works, and generally minds his own business now.  He is not a party-goer.\nThe unique situation in which Applicant found himself in June 2007 has not been repeated.  He\ncontinues to comply with all security requirements for his clearance.  The changes Applicant made\nin his life or were made for him by the administrative discharge do not cast doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  His behavior in 2007 no longer serves as a basis for\ncoercion, exploitation or duress.  He is not now in a position, as he was in the Navy working with\nclassified military information and systems, in which he would be able to compromise classified\ninformation.  There have been no further incidents and Applicant no longer consumes alcohol.\nApplicant\u2019s current sexual actions are strictly private and discreet.  His activities at the 2007 party\nwere not private, but two of the actions occurred in bedrooms with an expectation of privacy.  There\nare no other incidents after his discharge, and his record of behavior is clear.  Being abstinent now\nhelps Applicant exercise  proper judgment.  Under Guideline E, the government alleged the same\nconduct as it alleged under Guideline D.  Applicant\u2019s answers about his employment on the SF-86\nwill be considered only as they relate to his general credibility.  Applicant\u2019s conduct in June 2007,\nin the subsequent investigation and administrative discharge, and in his failure to explain specifically\nand with clarity the circumstances surrounding those incidents as he applied for a security clearance\nmake him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because it appears he is attempting to\nconceal information about himself.  This attitude diminishes Applicant\u2019s credibility as he attempts\nto explain the events of June 2007.  The incidents occurred three years ago, and there is no evidence\nof similar conduct.  The behavior occurred when Applicant was drunk at a party, and he has ceased\ndrinking alcohol.  The actions are unlikely to recur based upon all the changes Applicant has made\nin his life since January, 2008.  The incidents do not cast doubt on his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  He has made positive changes to reduce or eliminate any\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  Regarding the whole-person concept,\nApplicant was in a military environment in which he could not function positively.  Applicant was\n22 years old at the time and lacked a maturity level that would have allowed him to handle the\nstresses of military life.  Following his discharge, he successfully sought counseling and\nemployment.  There is little likelihood of a recurrence of such incidents because Applicant has\nmatured through professional counseling.  Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from\nhis sexual behavior and personal conduct.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s Guideline D mitigation analysis is flawed\nbecause he wrongfully concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct at the June 2007 party and Applicant\u2019s\n\u201cdiminished credibility\u201d did not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and\njudgment under Mitigating Condition \u00b6 14(b).1 Department Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s analysis\ndoes not take into account significant record evidence and fails to weigh the seriousness of\nApplicant\u2019s conduct at the June 2007 party.  Department Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s assessment\nof Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment did not reflect the Judge\u2019s own\nnegative view of Applicant\u2019s credibility, which included the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had\nrefused to acknowledge his behavior, notwithstanding the evidence of the misconduct contained in\nthe statements of the victims.  \n\n2\u2018[T]he behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress[.]\u201d\n4\nConcerning the alleged failure of the Judge to weigh properly or assess the seriousness of\nApplicant\u2019s conduct at the party, Department Counsel\u2019s argument is not persuasive.  The argument\nlacks detail as to the precise manner in which the Judge erred.  After a review of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision, the Board concludes that the Judge reasonably characterized the incidents at the June 2007\nparty as serious, noting at various points in his decision that Applicant\u2019s behavior was criminal,\nhighly risky, and indicative of a lack of discretion and judgment.  At the same time, for purposes of\nevaluating mitigation under \u00b6 14(b), the Judge pointed out the unique circumstances surrounding the\nconduct at the party, the fact that Applicant has attended counseling, and the fact that Applicant has\nmade positive changes in his life in support of his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s prior behavior no\nlonger casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  These matters in\nmitigation are reasonably supported by the record evidence. \nUnder \u00b6 14(b),the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s credibility was diminished in the context\nof his explanation of the events of June 2007 because it appeared that he was attempting to conceal\ninformation about himself.  Department Counsel argues that this negative credibility assessment\nconflicts with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that there is no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness under \u00b6 14(b).  This argument has merit.  The Judge\u2019s comments about Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility that were referenced by Department Counsel are actually contained in an analysis under\nGuideline E as opposed to Guideline D.  However, the fact that a conflicting conclusion occurred\nunder a different adjudicative guideline is of no consequence.  The concepts of reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment are not malleable to the point where their meaning varies among\nthe several guidelines.  By analyzing the case in a piecemeal fashion, the Judge  reached conclusions\nthat are in conflict.  While a negative credibility determination does not mandate a particular result\nin a case, its presence in a case is troubling where the Judge ultimately deems Applicant reliable and\ntrustworthy.\nDepartment Counsel takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion under Guideline D Mitigating\nCondition \u00b6 14(c)2 that, in his current position, Applicant is not in a position to compromise\nclassified information.  The conclusion is based on Applicant\u2019s testimony that, as an administrative\nassistant, he currently needs a clearance only to have occasional access to classified areas of his\nworkplace.  Department Counsel rightly argues that the notion that Applicant is not in a position to\ncompromise classified information is incongruous with the holding of a security clearance.  The\nJudge\u2019s conclusion is in error.\nDepartment Counsel also points out that the Judge\u2019s application of  \u00b6 14(c) is in conflict with\nhis later analysis under Guideline E where he stated that Applicant\u2019s failure to explain specifically\nand clearly his conduct at the party makes him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nThus, again, the Judge has reached conflicting conclusions under two different Adjudicative\n\n3The applicable Guideline E provision is \u00b6 16(e), which states in part, \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. . .\u201d\n4\u201c[T]he sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet[.]\u201d\n5\nGuidelines, one of which is a mitigating condition (under Guideline D) and the other a disqualifying\ncondition (under Guideline E).3  \nDepartment Counsel also correctly points out that the Judge misapplied Guideline D\nMitigating Condition \u00b6 14(d).4 By relying on Applicant\u2019s current sexual actions as a partial basis for\napplying the mitigating condition, the Judge erred by (1) referring to facts that are not part of the\nrecord evidence, and (2) by misinterpreting the proper scope of \u00b6 14(d).  There is no evidence in the\nrecord, either explicit or discernable by reasonable inference, that would allow the Judge to make\na favorable assessment of Applicant\u2019s current sexual practices.  Also, the sexual behavior anticipated\nby the mitigating condition must, of necessity, be sexual behavior that gave rise to the initial security\nconcerns, i.e., the June 2007 sexual activity alleged in the SOR.  The mitigating condition would\ncover current sexual behavior only if the sexual conduct of security concern was ongoing.  Ongoing\nsexual behavior of security concern is not present in this case.  The Judge also discusses the 2007\nsexual conduct when applying the mitigating condition, and he states that Applicant assumed he was\ninvited for sexual activity with his friend and the friend\u2019s girlfriend, and two of the sexual incidents\noccurred in bedrooms with an expectation of privacy by Applicant.  These factors were presumably\noffered by the Judge in support of his conclusion that the June 2007 sexual activity was \u201cstrictly\nprivate, consensual, and discreet.\u201d  However, the Judge made other findings of fact that conflict with\nthose used to justify application of the mitigating factor.  He found that Applicant\u2019s acts were\ncriminal, compulsive, highly risky, were of a public nature, and demonstrated a lack of discretion\nand judgment.  The Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s friends did not consent to Applicant\u2019s\nactivities and eventually filed criminal complaints.  After a review of the record and the Judge\u2019s\ndecision, the Board concludes that the Judge erred by invoking mitigating factor \u00b6 14(d) because the\nfacts used to justify its applicability are in conflict with other factual findings of the Judge, and the\nreasons offered in support of applying \u00b6 14(d) are not sustainable given the substantial contrary\nrecord evidence.\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that there are similar problems with the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis under Guideline E.  Again, the Judge\u2019s negative credibility determination undercuts the\nJudge\u2019s application of Guideline E Mitigating Factor \u00b6 17(c) with its requirement that the behavior\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  As discussed\npreviously, it is difficult to square the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant appears not to have been\nentirely forthright about his involvement in sexual activity in June 2007 with his conclusion that\nApplicant is ultimately reliable and trustworthy.  The Judge\u2019s application of Guideline E Mitigating\nFactor \u00b6 17(d) is also problematic in that one of the requirements stated therein is \u201cthe individual\nhas acknowledged the behavior.\u201d  The record does not contain such an acknowledgment from\nApplicant.  Notwithstanding the fact that Applicant\u2019s ingestion of alcohol may have impaired his\nability to remember details concerning his behavior, the Judge\u2019s negative credibility assessment\nappears to discount this possibility, and it is improper to apply a mitigating condition where a key\n\n5\u201c[T]he individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\nor duress[.]\u201d\n6\ncomponent of the condition is not present in the record evidence.  Regarding Guideline E Mitigating\nCondition \u00b6 17(e),5 Department Counsel correctly argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis in applying the\ncondition is contradicted by his specific conclusion that Applicant was vulnerable to exploitation,\nmanipulation, and duress because it appears he is attempting to conceal information about himself.\nDepartment Counsel acknowledges that many of the same errors in analysis discussed\npreviously are contained in the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis.  On remand, the Judge is directed\nto conduct his whole-person analysis in a manner consistent with the correction of errors described\nherein.  The Board also notes that Department Counsel included as an assignment of error the\nJudge\u2019s omission of Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 16(c) and \u00b6 16(d) from his analysis.\nAfter a consideration of the entire record, the Board concludes that the Judge was not required to\napply those disqualifying conditions as a matter of law.          \nOn remand, the Judge shall issue a new decision in which: (1) the Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination is integrated into his analysis under each of the applicable guidelines and under the\nwhole-person analysis; (2) the Judge does not consider Applicant\u2019s current exposure, or lack thereof,\nto classified information as a factor in determining Applicant\u2019s security eligibility; (3) the Judge\ndoes not speculate about matters not in evidence; and (4) the Judge\u2019s analysis under individual\nguidelines or the whole-person does not contradict his analysis under other guidelines. \nOrder    \nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s preceding discussion, the Judge\u2019s decision granting\nApplicant a security clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

    "judges_findings_of_fact": ": Applicant joined the Navy in April 2005. He served three years of active duty until being administratively discharged on January 31, 2008, with an honorable discharge. During his Navy service, Applicant had a security clearance. No violations of security procedures or regulations were committed by Applicant while he held the clearance. Applicant had some personality conflicts with other service people while on active duty. He attributed the conflicts to judgments people made about his poor economic background and his bisexual interests. Applicant was involved in three incidents involving other service people and alcohol. These involved assaults. After one of the incidents, Applicant informed his command that he was assaulted because he was gay. Because of this admission, his commander began processing him for administrative separation. About two months later, in June 2007, Applicant attended a party where everyone drank alcohol, and it was Applicant\u2019s impression that everyone was intoxicated. Applicant drank to excess, claimed he later blacked out, and does not remember making any sexual or improper advances toward any woman or man during the party. Applicant asserted that one friend at the party wanted him to engage in three-way sex with him and the friend\u2019s girlfriend. The friend and his girlfriend deny that this request occurred. While at the party, Applicant was alleged to have groped his friend\u2019s girlfriend while seeking sex from her, to have put his hands down the pants of another male party-goer, and to have later performed fellatio on his friend who invited him to the party. Thereafter, a Navy investigation occurred that resulted in court-martial charges and an Article 32 investigation. Applicant was accused of sodomy, assault, and indecent assault under the UCMJ. The charges were withdrawn when Applicant accepted the administrative discharge. Applicant no longer consumes alcohol. He works for his defense contractor, attends college classes, and goes to his synagogue. Since March 2008, he has attended counseling to help him understand his life and interests. Applicant did not disclose on his SF-86 the circumstances under which he left the Navy. He did disclose that he left a civilian job in August 2003 by mutual agreement after allegations of unsatisfactory performance. The Judge reached the following",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nBraden M. Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel on the Appeal \nFor Applicant: Andrea L. Reino, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nRemand Decision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn August 8, 2008, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On August 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nD (Sexual Behavior) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 21, 2009. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on October 1, 2009, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on October 2, 2009. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 7, 2010, and I received the case \nassignment on January 13, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January 29, \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 14, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 25, 2010. The Government \noffered Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified. \nApplicant had no exhibits to offer into the record. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on March 9, 2010.  \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, in a decision dated November 19, 2010, remanded my \noriginal favorable decision based on an analysis of my conclusions under both security \nconcerns. After reading the Appeal Board decision, and their instructions, I make the \nfollowing revisions in my decision after considering all the evidence again and the \nissues addressed in the Appeal Board decision. Therefore, based upon a further review \nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, testimony and the Appeal Board\u2019s decision, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nRemand Findings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a, and \nat the hearing he admitted the allegations in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR, with explanations. He \nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. (Tr. 11)  \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old and works for a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed there for 20 months, since January 2008. He joined the Navy in April 2005 \nwhile he was in college studying engineering. He served three years of active duty until \nbeing administratively discharged on January 31, 2008, with an honorable discharge. \nDuring his Navy service Applicant had a security clearance. No violations of security \nprocedures or regulations were committed by Applicant while he held the clearance. \nApplicant lives with his mother and brother at present. Applicant joined the Navy to help \nhis mother financially and because he was not doing well academically in the \nengineering school. (Tr. 17-19, 26, 27, 30-33, 69, 70; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant had some personality conflicts with other service people while on active \nduty. He attributed those conflicts to the judgments people made about him based on \nhis economically poor childhood and his bisexual interests. Applicant was involved in \nthree incidents involving other service people and alcohol. (Tr. 19-94) \n \n \nThe first incident occurred in March 2007 in which Applicant was physically \nassaulted by two very intoxicated men because of his race and sexual preference, \naccording to Applicant. He left a voicemail message on the phone of his barracks \nleading petty officer that he was assaulted because he was gay. Applicant knew his \ncommander accepted the version of the altercation presented by the two other people, \nwho were extremely intoxicated. Because of this admission, he was to be processed by \nhis commander for administrative separation. The processing of that paperwork started \ntwo months before the party in June 2007 at which the incidents leading to Applicant\u2019s \nadministrative discharge occurred.  When he was on leave, he told his mother about his \npending separation. He claimed she said hateful things to him and told Applicant she \ndid not love him anymore. (Tr. 19-25, 35-38, 94; Exhibits 2, 3)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was involved in a second incident in May 2007. Navy men tickled him. \nApplicant concluded he was being harassed. He made a complaint to his superiors. His \nleading petty officer submitted a statement that three men told him that Applicant made \nthem feel uncomfortable. Applicant denies sexual contact with any of these three men. \n(Tr. 38-40; Exhibits 2, 3)  \n \nOn June 22, 2007, Applicant and a friend bought alcohol for his friend\u2019s party. \nThe friend was hosting a party at his house. Everyone at the party drank alcohol and \nwas intoxicated, in Applicant\u2019s opinion. Applicant drank to excess and claimed he later \n\u201cblacked out.\u201d Applicant\u2019s friend, the party host, drank too much alcohol and \nregurgitated on his clothing and the kitchen floor later in the evening. The host fell \nasleep at that point. The host\u2019s friends then put him to bed after removing his clothing to \nmake him comfortable. Applicant wanted to be in the bedroom with his friend, but the \nman\u2019s girlfriend was uncomfortable with that request. She put a laundry basket in the \ndoorway to keep it open. Later she found the bedroom door closed. She entered the \nroom to find Applicant performing oral sex on her unconscious boyfriend. Applicant does \nnot remember making any sexual or improper advances toward any woman or man that \nevening. He cannot admit or deny the incident because he does not know what \nhappened. He blames his extreme intoxication for his inability to remember anything \nabout that party. He woke up on the floor of the house where the party occurred. \nApplicant asserted his friend wanted them to engage in a sexual three-some with his \ngirlfriend. The friend and his girlfriend deny that request ever occurred. (Tr. 19-26, 40-\n44, 54-61; Exhibits 2, 3) \n \n \nThe Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice (U.C.M.J.), Navy investigating \nofficer told Applicant the accusations against him for his alleged activities the night of \nthe party in June 2007. He was accused of sodomy (Article 125), assault (Article 128), \nand indecent assault (Article 134), under the U.C.M.J. in October 2007.  Applicant was \nalleged to have groped his friend\u2019s girlfriend while seeking sex from her, put his hands \ndown the pants of another male party-goer, and later was found performing fellatio on \nhis friend who invited him to the party. His friend was unconscious in his bed at the time. \nHis friend and Applicant knew each other from their training school. Applicant claimed \n\u201cthe first time I met him he humped me, but we were pretty good friends.\u201d His friend \nremembered nothing from the incident because of his intoxication. No civilian criminal \ncharges were filed against Applicant. A Navy investigation occurred that resulted in the \ncourt-martial charges and the Article 32 investigation. These charges were withdrawn \nwhen Applicant accepted the administrative discharge. (Tr. 21-26, 44-46; Exhibits 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant does not consume alcohol anymore. He performs his work for the \ndefense contractor that employs him, attends college classes, and goes to his \nsynagogue. Since March 2008, he has attended counseling to help him understand his \nlife and interests. Applicant would like to finish college and work in the medical field. (Tr. \n26-30, 64-65; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant accepted his administrative discharge instead of a court-martial. He \nwas told that he would receive a dishonorable discharge if he chose a court-martial \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninstead of accepting an honorable discharge through the administrative process. \nApplicant did not disclose on his SF-86 in response to Question 23 (e) that he faced \ncourt-martial charges because he was not presented with \u201cdirect charges.\u201d He did not \ndisclose on the SF-86 in response to Question 22 that he left the Navy \u201cfollowing \nallegations of misconduct,\u201d because he did not think he engaged in any misconduct. Nor \ndid he disclose in the same answer that he \u201cleft a job for other reasons under \nunfavorable circumstances,\u201d because his military service was favorably rated in his \nperformance appraisals. He did disclose in Question 22 that he left a civilian job in \nAugust 2003 by mutual agreement after allegations of unsatisfactory performance. (Tr. \n46-50, 69; Exhibit 1) \n \nRemand Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \n\n \n5 \n \n \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nRemand Analysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. All of them apply to this case: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \n \nApplicant engaged in sexual acts in June 2007 at a party with friends. Those \nfriends did not consent to these activities and filed complaints with the appropriate Navy \nofficials against Applicant. The Navy investigated and preferred court-martial charges \nagainst Applicant for assault, indecent assault, and sodomy pursuant to the U.C.M.J. \nApplicant\u2019s actions were of a criminal nature. AG \u00b6 13 (a) applies.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe night of the party in June 2007 Applicant made sexual advances or \ncommitted sexual acts on three persons. The multitude of actions within a short period \nof time at the party shows a pattern of compulsive sexual acts by Applicant as he \nsought to gratify his desires that night. Those actions were highly risky and showed he \nwas unable to stop or control his behavior. AG \u00b6 13 (b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant perpetrated sexual assaults on two males and one female that make \nhim vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress if these incidents became known. \nThe variety of acts, his denial of them, coupled with his continued statements that he \nremembers nothing about that evening\u2019s events and the resulting criminal investigation, \nare the basis for that vulnerability if the events were known publically. AG \u00b6 13 (c) \napplies. \n \n \nFinally, Applicant committed his actions at a party in front of other persons such \nthat they can be construed to be of a public nature. Making unwanted sexual advances \nto a man and a woman show a serious lack of discretion and judgment. AG \u00b6 13 (d) \napplies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Three \nconditions might apply: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s actions occurred three years ago while \nhe was in the Navy and attended a party with friends, which is not an unusual event. \nThis incident was the third one in which Applicant was involved between March and \nJune 2007 involving alcohol and some type of altercation with men. The pattern of these \nincidents and his failure to alter his behavior so as not to be involved in such situations \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. They \nalso diminish his overall credibility.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior in 2007 serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. During his testimony, Applicant repeatedly stated he could not remember \nanything about the June 2007 sexual incidents. The explicit statements from other \nwitnesses concerning the events at the party are credible because of their specificity.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to recall the situations that caused his administrative discharge from \nthe Navy make his statements is neither persuasive nor believable. His statements \nindicated that he wrongly assumed his friends consented to the sexual activity in 2007 \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand sought his participation in a sexual three-some. There is no evidence from the other \nwitnesses to support that statement. The totality of the situation in June 2007, if \npublically known, would render Applicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 14 (c) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (d) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s activities at the party were not private \nbecause they occurred at a party and were done publically. Applicant claims the alcohol \nhe consumed at the party diminished his capacity to control his behavior and made him \nblack out so he cannot remember what happened. His activities were not consensual on \nthe part of the other person and were not discreet according to the statements of the \nother witnesses. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action \nor administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nThe Government alleged the same conduct under the Personal Conduct \nguideline as it alleged under the Sexual Behavior guideline. At the hearing, questions \nwere asked about Applicant\u2019s disclosures on his SF-86. The Government argued in its \nclosing that Applicant\u2019s credibility was an issue because of his failure to disclose certain \ninformation about the U.C.M.J. investigation and his administrative discharge. (Tr. 82-\n85) The SOR was not amended to allege a failure to answer the SF-86 questions \ntruthfully. Therefore, I have not considered any issue beyond Applicant\u2019s general \ncredibility relating to his behavior under this security guideline. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Pertaining to the allegation of criminal conduct in 2007 resulting in \nU.C.M.J. charges of sodomy, assault, and indecent assault, one condition applies: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in June 2007, in the subsequent investigation and \nadministrative discharge, and his failure to explain specifically and with clarity the \ncircumstances surrounding those incidents as he applied for a security clearance make \nhim vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because it appears he is \nattempting to conceal information about himself. His lack of candor and evasive \ntestimony raises questions about his credibility. His concealment of the conduct at the \nparty creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct in June 2007 may affect his professional and community standing if his \nactions were known publically. AG \u00b6 16 (e) applies.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate the above security \nconcerns. Three conditions might apply: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAlthough the incidents as alleged in SOR Paragraph 1.a. occurred three years \nago they were not minor actions. They involved sexual assaults upon a man and a \nwoman in a social environment. The party was not an unusual circumstance or event. \nApplicant\u2019s three incidents in three months involving alcohol, other men, and his alleged \nsexual actions at party to which he had been invited by a friend, cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Hence, AG \u00b6 17 (c) does not \napply.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant did not admit or deny the incident in June 2007. He claims he could not \nremember what happened. While not admitting the June 2007 incident, Applicant now \nclaims he started counseling in March 2008 and continues it today to help him deal with \nissues in his life. He did not explain how this counseling relates to the intoxication \nissues and his behavior in the three incidents occurring during 2007. Applicant has not \nexplained how the same type of incident will not recur. His repeated denials of any \nwrongdoing cast serious doubt on his credibility when contrasted to the specific \nstatements of witnesses. AG \u00b6 17 (d) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has not shown any positive steps he took in the past three years to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He claims he \nstopped drinking alcohol and actively sought the counseling he thought he needed to \nresolve any issues in his life. He did not present any corroborating evidence to show the \ncounseling addressed the stressors in his life in 2007. He did not express any remorse \nfor the incidents. Living at home, getting a job, and attending college are normal \nactivities. Applicant did not demonstrate how these ordinary events changed the \nunderlying social behavior problems he exhibited in 2007. He has not provided any \nevidence that he informed his family, friends, or employers about the incidents that \nformed the basis for this security concern. AG \u00b6 17 (e) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant presented himself in a \nprofessional manner at the hearing.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant was in a military environment within which he could not function \npositively. The freedom of being away from his family led him to alcohol consumption \nand socializing with people whom he thought were his friends. They accused him of \nengaging in inappropriate sexual behaviors. His commander investigated the \nallegations, and offered Applicant the opportunity to leave military service with an \nhonorable discharge. The three incidents of misconduct forming the basis of the \nadministrative discharge occurred three years ago and were serious. Applicant was a \n22-year-old adult at the time of the three incidents. He had two years of military service \nat the time of his discharge. He knew what was expected of him in the Navy concerning \nthe performance of his duty. As an adult, he also knew or should have known what \ninappropriate sexual conduct toward other persons was.   \n \nFollowing his administrative discharge, he sought counseling for problems that \nApplicant did not specify at the hearing. There was no evidence from Applicant that this \ncounseling addressed the underlying reasons for his intoxication and incidents in 2007. \n \nApplicant\u2019 conduct was voluntary in 2007. He exhibited no remorse for his \nmisconduct. He did not present any evidence that he altered his behavior regarding \nsuch serious misconduct. There is no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavior \nchange.  \n \nThe potential for coercion, exploitation, pressure, or duress exists because he \nhas kept the nature of the incidents undisclosed from his family and employers. He \ncontinued his lack of disclosure at the hearing by claiming his extreme intoxication \ncaused him to \u201cblackout\u201d and not remember anything that happened at the party. He \nhas a serious alcohol problem if consumption causes that condition. There is no \nevidence Applicant eliminated the causes of the intoxication from his life.  \n \n The type of extreme intoxication described by Applicant may recur and place \nhim in a vulnerable situation in the future regarding the safeguarding of classified \ninformation. Applicant does not acknowledge anything illegal or inappropriate occurred \nat the party. He steadfastly adheres to this version of the party incidents. That raises \nserious issues about his reliability, good judgment, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his sexual \nbehavior and personal conduct security concerns.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 20, 2008. On \nNovember 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline G. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 14, 2009; answered it on December \n31, 2009; and requested a determination on the record without a hearing before an \nMarch 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 4, 2010. On January 19, \n2010, Department Counsel requested a hearing and notified Applicant of his request. \n(Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II.) Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n26, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on February 2, 2010. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on February 16, 2010, scheduling the hearing for February 25, 2010. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but presented no \ndocumentary evidence. I kept the record open until March 8, 2010, to enable him to \nsubmit evidence. At his request, I extended the deadline until March 15, 2010. (HX III.) \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX A are attached to the record as HX III. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 4, 2010. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel orally notified Applicant of the time and place of the hearing \non February 13, 2010, and the notice of hearing was dated February 16, 2010. Both \nnotifications were less than the 15 days required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. I explained the \nnotice requirement to Applicant, and he affirmatively waived the 15-day notice \nrequirement. (Tr. 20-22.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, \nand 1.d. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old computer programmer employed by a federal \ncontractor. He graduated from college in May 2008, and began working for his current \nemployer in June 2008. (AX A at 1.) His performance appraisal for the period ending in \nMay 2009 portrays him as eager to learn, hard working, creative, dependable, and \nconsiderate of colleagues and subordinates. His was rated \u201cfully successful,\u201d the middle \nrating among five ranging from unsatisfactory to outstanding. (AX A at 12.) \n \n \nIn October 2007, while Applicant was 21 years old and in college, he was \narrested in a bar for public intoxication.1 The bar was open to the public, but its clientele \nwas mostly members of certain fraternities of which Applicant was not a member. He \nhad consumed more than six drinks, but there was no evidence that he was disruptive \nor disorderly. As he was standing alone waiting for a friend to return from the restroom, \nhe was approached by a police officer performing security duties at the bar, and asked \nto go outside. He was arrested, held at the police station overnight to sober up, \nreleased, and fined $70. (Tr. 43-46; GX 3 at 1; GX 4 at 3.) He disclosed this incident on \nhis security clearance application. (GX 2 at 30.) \n                                                          \n1 The court records reflect the charge as \u201cpublic swearing/intoxication.\u201d The parties agreed that there was \nno inappropriate language involved, and that the court information was based on the fact that both public \nswearing and public intoxication were proscribed by the same law. (Tr. 60.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nIn October 2008, Applicant was arrested for having an open container of beer \nand obstructing justice. The incident occurred while he and his girlfriend were walking \nbetween two tailgate parties preceding a football game. He was carrying a plastic cup of \nbeer. When he was approached by a police vehicle, he put his cup on the ground and \nwalked between two cars in a parking lot. He was arrested and given a breathalyzer \ntest, which registered a blood-alcohol level of .06%. The next day, he reported the \nincident to his security officer. In November 2008, he voluntarily disclosed this incident \nduring a security interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), who apparently had not been informed of the incident. (Tr. 48-51; \nGX 4 at 3.) \n \nApplicant pleaded guilty to having an open container. He was fined $70, ordered \nto perform 70 hours of community service, and required to pay a $125 registration fee \nfor the community service. \n \n \nWhen questioned about his drinking habits, Applicant told a OPM investigator \nthat he drank four or five beers, enough to become intoxicated, one to three times a \nweek while socializing with friends. The investigator\u2019s written summary of the interview \nrecites: \u201cSubject has not stopped or reduced use, because subject does not have a \nproblem with alcohol. Subject intends to use alcohol in the future.\u201d (GX 4 at 4.) In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories dated April 7, 2009, Applicant stated that the \ninterview summary was accurate except for one item not relevant to the allegations in \nthe SOR. (GX 4 at 6.) However, in his response to the SOR, he stated that the portion \nof the summary pertaining to his alcohol consumption was inaccurate. He stated it \nwould have been more accurate to say, \u201cYou become intoxicated one time a week, but \nnever more than three times.\u201d Finally, he stated that the portrayal of his future intentions \nin the interview summary was the product of an ill-framed question, because if he had \nbeen asked whether he would consider reducing his drinking, his answer would have \nbeen a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d (Answer at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his arrest in October 2008 and the security interview in \nNovember 2008 made him realize that alcohol-related incidents could jeopardize his \nemployment. (Tr. 54.) He testified his job is \u201cextremely\u201d important to him. (Tr. 67.) At the \nhearing, he testified he has reduced his drinking to about once a month at social events. \nHe limits his consumption to two drinks. He last consumed alcohol about six weeks \nbefore the hearing. (Tr. 56-57.) His reduced consumption was motivated in part by his \ndecision to consume healthier foods and exercise more. He testified he feels better on a \nhealthier diet and intends to adhere to it. (Tr. 65-66.) \n \n \nApplicant has never received any alcohol-related treatment and has never been \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. (Tr. 53.) He testified he has never driven while \nintoxicated. (Tr. 54.) He also testified he understands the concern that excessive \nalcohol consumption causes poor decisions, and \u201cconfidential information is not \nsomething you want to leave in the hands of somebody who can\u2019t control themselves.\u201d \n(Tr. 59.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \n\n \n5 \n \n \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, \u201cat times to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication,\u201d from approximately 2005 to at least 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he \nbecomes intoxicated one to three times a week and does not intend to reduce or stop \nusing alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It also alleges he was arrested and charged with \u201cpublic \nswearing/intoxication\u201d in September 2007, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to pay a \nfine and costs (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Finally, it alleges he was arrested and charged with \u201cpublic \nswearing/intoxication and obstruction of justice without force in about September 2008, \nprosecution was deferred, he was ordered to perform 50 hours of community service \nand pay court costs, and the charges were dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, but he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nand he testified that the allegations were based on an inaccurate summary of an OPM \ninterview. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d A disqualifying condition may arise under this guideline by  \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, \nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d or \n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless \nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n22 (a) and (c).  \n \nBoth disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on whether the conduct was \nrecent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If \nthe evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nAlthough Applicant did not specifically state the date on which he decided to reduce his \nalcohol consumption, it appears to have occurred shortly after his OPM interview in \nNovember 2008. He is not alcohol dependent, and his change of behavior was \nprompted by the realization that he could not continue his college lifestyle if he wanted \nto continue his employment. He has had no further instances of alcohol-related \nmisconduct. He last consumed alcohol six weeks before the hearing. He limits his \nconsumption to two drinks. I am satisfied that his excessive alcohol consumption is not \nrecent and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 23(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). After his security \ninterview in November 2008, Applicant realized that his alcohol use could jeopardize his \nemployment. He testified he does not believe he has an \u201calcohol problem,\u201d but he \nacknowledged his previous alcohol abuse at the hearing. He drastically reduced his \nalcohol consumption and established a pattern of responsible use after his November \n2008 security interview. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is established. No other enumerated \nmitigating conditions are relevant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a young man, working at his first job after college. He is enthusiastic \nabout his work and has performed well. The two arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d \nwere for relatively minor offenses, but more serious security concerns were raised by \nhis OPM interview describing his heavy alcohol consumption and his intention to \ncontinue it. Applicant mitigated those concerns at the hearing, when he declared his \nintention to drastically reduce his alcohol consumption. He was candid, sincere, \nremorseful, and credible. He has demonstrated his sincerity by reducing the frequency \nof his drinking and limiting himself to two drinks. He has learned that working for a \nfederal contractor and holding a clearance are incompatible with the personal conduct \nthat was tolerated in a college environment. There is no evidence that he is alcohol \ndependent. He persuaded me that he has put his college habits behind him, begun to \nact like an adult, and decided that his employment and his health require a more \nresponsible lifestyle. \n \n \nApplicant has been candid throughout the security clearance process. He \ndisclosed his September 2007 arrest on his security clearance application. He reported \nthe October 2008 incident to his superiors the day after it happened. He voluntarily \ndisclosed the October 2008 incident to the security investigator, who apparently had not \nbeen informed of it by Applicant\u2019s superiors.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve doubtful cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 51-year-old machine operator, who has worked for the same defense contractor since August 1984, initially as a machinist and then as a toolmaker. (GE 3; Tr. 208.) Applicant seeks to retain a secret security clearance, which was granted to him in March 2002. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 86.) Applicant married his present wife in September 2004. Applicant has a son, who is now 23 years old, with whom he has smoked marijuana. Applicant has no contact with his first wife, to whom he was married from May 1981 to January 1986. (GEs 1, 2.) Applicant served on active duty in the United States military from 1979 to 1983. (Tr. 85.) While in the active reserves from 1983 to 1985, Applicant began using marijuana sporadically. After he began working for his current employer in 1984, Applicant smoked marijuana two or three times a month on the weekends. (Tr. 93-94.)

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a long history of noncompliance with the treatment protocol for his \ndiagnosed bipolar disorder, resulting in impairment of his judgment and in dysfunctional \nbehavior requiring hospitalization. He abused marijuana from about 1983 to November \n2010, including since 2002 with a Department of Defense security clearance. He also drank \nalcohol to at least 2007, knowing it could impair the effectiveness of his psychiatric \nmedications. Clearance denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 8, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nI (Psychological Conditions), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) as to why it could not find that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. DOHA took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n \n06/14/2012\n\n \n \n2 \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated answer, in which he responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing. On May 3, 2012, the case was assigned to me to \nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him. On May 16, 2012, I scheduled a hearing for June 6, 2012. \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Twenty-nine Government exhibits (GEs 1-\n29) were admitted into evidence. GEs 16 and 17 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objection \nabout the psychiatric medications reported in the medical records, and with respect to GE \n17, also about the accuracy of the report of the incident that led to his hospitalization. GE \n28 was admitted over Applicant\u2019s objection to the accuracy of the treatment dates and \ndiagnoses reported by the provider. GE 29 was objected to on the basis of an incomplete \nlisting of his psychiatric medications. His objections went to the weight of the information \nrather than its admissibility. Thirteen Applicant exhibits (AEs A-M) were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript \n(Tr.) received by DOHA on June 14, 2012. \n \nI held the record open for one week after the hearing for Applicant to submit \ncharacter reference letters. On June 14, 2012, I granted a brief extension at Applicant\u2019s \nrequest. On June 18, 2012, I received six letters, which were marked collectively as AE N. \nDepartment Counsel did not object, and the exhibit was admitted.  \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline I that Applicant failed to take medications \nprescribed for his mental health condition at times between 1996 and 2008, resulting in an \nimpairment of his judgment and in dysfunctional behavior requiring hospitalization (SOR \n1.a). Under Guideline G, Applicant allegedly consumed alcohol, at times to excess, from \n1996 to at least 2007, aware that alcohol could have an adverse effect on his treatment \nand mental health, and that his drinking resulted, at times, in hallucinations and \nuncontrolled behavior requiring hospitalization (SOR 2.a). Applicant was alleged under \nGuideline H to have abused marijuana and PCP in 2007 and 2008, knowing that use of \nother drugs could have an adverse effect on his treatment and his mental health, and \nresulting in hallucinations and uncontrolled behavior requiring periodic hospitalization (SOR \n3.a); to have continued to use marijuana in 2010 (SOR 3.b); and to have used marijuana \nand PCP while possessing a security clearance from about 2002 to at least 2010 (SOR \n3.c). The Guideline G and Guideline H allegations were also alleged to raise Guideline E \nconcerns (SOR 4.a). \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations, except for any knowing abuse of PCP. He \nattributed his \u201cPCP exposure\u201d to cough medicine ingested for chest congestion. Also, \nApplicant explained that his previous psychiatric medications (Risperdal and Depakote) \nhad unpleasant side effects and had not been completely effective in managing his mental \nillness. A change in his medications to Lamictal and Invega gradually brought about \u201ca \n\n \n \n3 \nnormalcy [he] had not felt before.\u201d Applicant also indicated that he realizes that \u201cthe \nnational interest is best served by an intolerance for substance abuse and [he intends his] \nactions to fully reflect that interest.\u201d \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the \npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old machine operator, who has worked for the same defense \ncontractor since August 1984, initially as a machinist and then as a toolmaker. (GE 3; Tr. \n208.) Applicant seeks to retain a secret security clearance, which was granted to him in \nMarch 2002. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 86.) \n \nApplicant married his present wife in September 2004. Applicant has a son, who is \nnow 23 years old, with whom he has smoked marijuana. Applicant has no contact with his \nfirst wife, to whom he was married from May 1981 to January 1986. (GEs 1, 2.) \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States military from 1979 to 1983. (Tr. \n85.) While in the active reserves from 1983 to 1985, Applicant began using marijuana \nsporadically. After he began working for his current employer in 1984, Applicant smoked \nmarijuana two or three times a month on the weekends. (Tr. 93-94.) He continued to use \nthe drug with varying frequency until November 2010, abstaining \u201cnumerous times.\u201d (Tr. \n95.) His longest abstention was for about six months in 2001 and 2002, after he applied for \nhis secret clearance. (Tr. 95.) Applicant purchased marijuana on occasion, and his son \nalso bought marijuana for him with money Applicant provided. (Tr. 96-97.) \n \nApplicant has been under the care of a succession of mental health providers for \ndiagnosed bipolar disorder since 1992. (Tr. 87-88.) Treatment, including prescribed \npsychiatric medications, has had varied success in managing his mental health condition, \nin part because Applicant has not always followed therapeutic advice. Salient details of his \nmental health condition and treatments, including the effects of his noncompliance with \ntreatment protocol, follow. \n \nIn 1990, Applicant was treated at a psychiatric hospital (psychiatric facility A), and he \nhad outpatient counseling at a local hospital. In September 1992, Applicant was arrested \nfor disturbing the peace. He and his then girlfriend (his son\u2019s mother) had broken off their \nrelationship, and he confronted her at church services before a member of the \ncongregation tackled him. The police took him to a local emergency room because he was \nconfused. Applicant was transferred to a psychiatric hospital (psychiatric facility B). (GE 4.) \nThe medical records of this hospitalization, or of his treatment with a private physician from \nOctober 1992 to February 1993, were not made available for my review. The criminal \ncharge was dismissed. (GEs 3, 4.) \n \nFrom February 1993 to December 1999, Applicant was under the active care of the \nsame psychiatrist. (GE 3.) Between 1992 and 1996, Applicant went off his medication at \n\n \n \n4 \ntimes due to confusion or lack of routine (i.e., missed doses). (Tr. 89-90.) Around 1994, \nApplicant began stopping once a week at a local bar on his way home from work and \ndrinking a couple of 16-ounce beers. (GE 5.) Around July 1, 1996, Applicant stopped taking \nhis Depakote medication for his bipolar disorder. He drank alcohol while on vacation, \nknowing that it could interfere with his psychiatric medications. (Tr. 92.) He did not sleep \nover the next few days. En route home from vacation, Applicant stopped at a motel with his \nspouse (then girlfriend) and his son. He became violent after arguing with his girlfriend, and \nthe police arrived to find him \u201csmashing up\u201d his motel room.1 Applicant was combative with \nthe police, and he was arrested for aggravated assault and disturbing the peace.2 (GEs 3, \n17; Tr. 91, 124-30.) The police brought Applicant to a local emergency room because he \nwas agitated and incoherent. Applicant was diagnosed with psychotic disorder, not \notherwise specified, and he was prescribed antipsychotic and tranquilizer medications \nbefore being transferred to a psychiatric hospital (psychiatric facility C). (GEs 4, 16.)  \n \nApplicant was treated at psychiatric facility C from July 5-11, 1996, for bipolar \ndisorder, manic with psychotic features, and for alcohol abuse-episodic. On admission, he \nwas cooperative and showed no signs of agitation, although his insight and judgment were \npoor. He was placed on Trilafon and Depakote, which he took with no problem. Applicant \nreported previous hospitalizations for his bipolar disorder; treatment with Trilafon, \nDepakote, and Lithium in the past;3 a long history of erratic compliance with his \nmedications; and consumption of beer. His condition was considered sufficiently stable to \ndischarge him with a good prognosis. He was advised to follow up with his private \npsychiatrist and to take his Trilafon and Depakote medications as prescribed. (GE 17.) \n \nOn February 22, 2000, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF \n86). He disclosed his arrest in 1996 and his psychiatric counseling since October 1992. \nApplicant did not report his treatment at psychiatric facility C in 1996. He also responded \n\u201cNo\u201d to whether he had illegally used any controlled substance, including marijuana, in the \nlast seven years. (GE 3.) During an interview with a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) \nspecial agent on June 27, 2000, Applicant admitted that he had been hospitalized for \nmental health treatment in 1990, 1992, and 1996. Concerning his behavior that led to his \ninvoluntary commitment in 1996, Applicant recalled that he had stopped taking his \nmedication a few days before the incident, and he was \u201cin a confused mental state\u201d that led \nhim to resist police. He disclosed a 1986 drunk-driving offense. There is no indication \nwhether illegal drug use was discussed. (GE 4.) \n \n                                                 \n1Applicant attributes his \u201cdifficulties\u201d on that occasion to primarily fatigue (driving too long without stopping \nto rest). (Tr. 74.) \n \n2 Applicant was later assessed a $2,000 fine and ordered to pay restitution on the criminal charges. (GEs \n3, 4.) \n \n3Applicant denies that he took any Lithium. (Tr. 26.) Emergency medical personnel listed Applicant\u2019s \nmedications as Depakote and Lithium in July 1996. (GE 16.) Applicant has a history of medication changes. \nHe could have been on Lithium until 1996. He testified he was on an antidepressant, although he cannot recall \nwhich one. (Tr. 89.) Alternatively, but less likely, Applicant may have told them he was on an antidepressant \nthat was presumed to be Lithium. In any event, there is no evidence that Applicant has been prescribed \nLithium since 1996. \n\n \n \n5 \nBetween June 2001 and September 2001, Applicant received alcohol-related \ntreatment. (GE 2.) On October 3, 2001, Applicant was re-interviewed by the DIS special \nagent to update his mental health situation. Applicant was continuing to see his \npsychiatrist, on a monthly basis for the past three months, due to changes in his \nmedication. Applicant reported no new hospitalization or legal incidents. Applicant denied \nthat he had a problem with alcohol. He indicated that between November 1999 and \nSeptember 2000, his sister and her two young daughters lived with him. He drank four or \nfive 12-ounce beers at bars after work while waiting to return home until after his nieces \nquieted down. Applicant denied becoming intoxicated, but he admitted that the alcohol \nreduced the effectiveness of one of his psychiatric medications. Applicant stopped \nfrequenting bars after his sister moved out. He indicated that he now drinks a lemon \nflavored malt liquor in responsible quantity, and he is \u201calways aware of the interaction \nbetween the alcohol and [his] medications.\u201d Applicant planned to drink occasionally unless \nor until his psychiatrist told him to stop due to his psychiatric medications. (GE 5.) \n \n \nIn February 2002, DOHA asked Applicant to undergo a substance abuse evaluation \nby a professional of his choice. On February 15, 2002, Applicant was evaluated by a PhD \nand LCSW-credentialed senior clinician affiliated with a substance abuse treatment facility. \nApplicant exhibited no gross disturbances to the content or character of his thought. In the \nopinion of the clinician, Applicant \u201cexhibited insight into the relationship of his past drinking \nand the stressors in his life as well as the need and the willingness to be compliant with his \nmedication in order to function in an acceptable manner both at work and at home.\u201d \nApplicant acknowledged that he had continued to drink alcohol, but he resolved to stop if \ndrinking would jeopardize his job. The substance abuse professional found no current \nevidence of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse (\u201cAt this time, a more accurate \ndescription of his past episodes appears to be Alcoholic Abuse (DSM-IV CPT 305.00)).\u201d \n(GE 6.) \n \n \nOn March 6, 2002, Applicant told DOHA that he believed his 1996 arrest and \ninvoluntary commitment to psychiatric facility C were due to alcohol interacting with his \nmedications. Realizing that \u201cunacceptable behavior\u201d could result from the interaction of \nalcohol and his medications, Applicant indicated that he had chosen to stop drinking. (GE \n6.) Applicant\u2019s secret clearance was issued to him in March 2002. (GE 2.) \n \nIn December 2002, Applicant started a therapeutic relationship (antipsychotic \nmedications and supportive psychotherapy) with a new psychiatrist for treatment of \ndiagnosed manic depressive disorder and alcoholism. While under the care of this \npsychiatrist, Applicant did well when he took his medications, but he had \u201ca few setbacks,\u201d \nin part because he went off his prescribed medications (i.e., Risperdal and Depakote4). \n                                                 \n4Applicant submitted information concerning recommended dosages, contraindications, drug interactions, and \npotential adverse reactions for psychiatric medications he has taken for his bipolar disorder: Risperdal \n(risperidone), an antipsychotic indicated for the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes in bipolar \npatients (AE H); Depakote, a valprobate anti-epileptic indicated for treatment of manic episodes associated \nwith bipolar disorder (AE I); Effexor XR (venlafaxine) (AE J) and Wellbutrin (bupropion) (AE K), \nantidepressants indicated for treatment of a major depressive disorder, but apparently not approved for use in \ntreating bipolar depression; Invega (palipridone, the major active metabolite of risperidone), an atypical \nantipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia (AE L), and Lamictal, an anti-epileptic indicated for maintenance \n\n \n \n6 \n(GE 28.) In April 2004, Applicant was found disoriented at his workplace several hours after \nhis shift had ended. He was transported by ambulance to a local hospital, where he was \nplaced on a medical hold. Applicant advised emergency staff that he suffered from bipolar \ndisorder, but he had not taken his Depakote medication. Applicant was diagnosed with \npsychosis, not otherwise specified, and bipolar disorder with manic episode. The next \nafternoon, Applicant was transferred to psychiatric facility A. (GE 18.) The records of this \nadmission to psychiatric facility A were not available for my review. \n \nOn February 7, 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86). \nHe listed his ongoing mental health counseling with a psychiatrist as well as his psychiatric \nadmissions in 2004. Applicant disclosed that he received alcohol treatment in 2001 \u201cat the \nrequest of DOD,\u201d and he maintained that he continued to exclude alcohol from his diet. \nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had used any illegal drugs in the last seven years \nand to whether he had ever used an illegal drug while holding a security clearance (GE 2), \nknowing that he should have reported his marijuana use on his SF 86. (Tr. 100.) \n \nIn mid-July 2006, Applicant was taken off Depakote and prescribed Lamictal due to \nweight gain. (AE F; Tr. 69.) By March 2007, Applicant was again experiencing some mental \ninstability, which he attributed to work stress. On March 7, 2007, local law enforcement was \ncalled to a gas station after Applicant was observed yelling profanities and wielding a \nhammer. (GEs 13, 19, 20.) Applicant was arrested for use and possession of drug \nparaphernalia and possession of marijuana after a wooden pipe and marijuana were found \non his person. (GEs 7, 13.) Applicant was also charged with breach of peace, 2nd degree. \n(GEs 13-15.) The police report indicates that Applicant was cooperative throughout \nbooking at police headquarters and that he was released on a promise to appear. (GE 13.) \nHowever, medical records show that Applicant was brought to a local hospital\u2019s emergency \nroom on a police hold at around 12:14 p.m. At the hospital, Applicant initially denied any \nillegal drug use, although he told nursing service that he smoked marijuana twice weekly, \nand a toxicology screen was positive for THC. (GE 19.) Applicant was transferred to \npsychiatric facility A, where he was admitted for treatment of diagnosed bipolar disorder, \nhypomanic. He exhibited abnormal behaviors initially, but his condition stabilized over the \nnext five days. He acknowledged that he was using marijuana on a \u201csomewhat frequent \nbasis\u201d and alcohol occasionally. Applicant was discharged on March 12, 2007, on Effexor, \nTileptal, Lisinopril, Simvastatin, Risperdal, and Lamictal medications and with instructions \nto follow up with his private psychiatrist. His prognosis was noted as \u201cchronic course.\u201d (GE \n20.) \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \ntreatment of bipolar disorder (AE M). The drug literature specifically cautions against the use of alcohol when \ntaking Risperdal or Invega. Consumption of minimal amounts of alcohol is not specifically contraindicated \nwhile taking Wellbutrin or Effexor, although patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Effexor. \nAlcohol use while taking Lamictal or Depakote is not contraindicated, but patients are advised to not drink \nwhile taking Depakote without first discussing it with their health care provider. Medication guidance for \nDepakote repeatedly warns against stopping the medication without first talking to a health care provider since \nsudden cessation can cause serious health problems. Furthermore, FDA-approved labeling indicates that the \nsafety and effectiveness of Depakote for long-term use (more than three weeks) has not been systematically \nevaluated in controlled clinical trials. Healthcare providers who prescribe Depakote for extended periods are \nadvised to continually reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug. (AE I.)  \n\n \n \n7 \nAround 2007, Applicant\u2019s son came to live with him and his spouse. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse was aware that Applicant was using marijuana with a friend outside of her \npresence although she disapproved. Before his son moved into their home, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse told Applicant that he had to set a good example and stop abusing marijuana. (Tr. \n140-41.) \n \n \nIn December 2007, Applicant was brought to the emergency room after his spouse \ncontacted 911 complaining that he was threatening and potentially violent. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse told the police that she believed Applicant had been drinking alcohol in their \nbasement because she found empty alcohol bottles there. He was also noncompliant with \nhis psychiatric medications. (GEs 21, 22.) Applicant appeared psychotic and disorganized \n(\u201ctalking nonsense\u201d) at the hospital. He reported sleep disturbance, mood swings, and \nauditory hallucinations, despite a medication regimen of several psychiatric medications, \nincluding Lamictal and Wellbutrin. (AE F.) Applicant admitted using marijuana and alcohol \nsocially. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (acute decompensation\u2014hypomanic) and \nprescribed Haldol and Ativan before being transferred to psychiatric facility A. (GE 21.) \n \n \nApplicant was an inpatient at psychiatric facility A for nine days in December 2007.  \nOn admission, Applicant presented as \u201cfloridly psychotic.\u201d He was diagnosed with bipolar \ndisorder, mixed, severe; alcohol abuse; and marijuana abuse. Applicant denied drinking. A \nurine sample was positive for marijuana and PCP. He was continued on his current \nmedications, but the dosage of Risperdal was increased while on the unit. At discharge, it \nwas noted that he remained mildly psychotic, although not agitated or threatening. He was \nprescribed Risperdal, Lisinopril, Wellbutrin, Effexor XR, and Lamictal and directed to follow \nup with his private psychiatrist. A staff psychiatrist gave him a guarded prognosis. (GE 22.) \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant pled guilty to the March 2007 possession of marijuana \ncharge. He was fined $85 plus $15 costs and assessed a $205 community service fee, \nwhich he paid in lieu of completing community service. The other charges were not \nprosecuted. (GEs 14, 15.) \n \n \nApplicant was on leave from work due to stress for about four months. He returned \nto work in February 2008, reportedly under less stressful conditions. He had been taken off \nRisperdal in favor of Invega in late January 2008. (AE F.) In early April 2008, Applicant \nstopped taking his Lamictal after his supply ran out. (GE 25.) He had another episode of \npsychosis in April 2008 of sufficient concern to his family to contact the police. He was \nbrought to a hospital emergency room on April 13, 2008, where he was evaluated by a \nlicensed clinical social worker (LCSW) affiliated with a mental health center. The LCSW \ncertified Applicant for psychiatric admission under a \u201cgravely disabled\u201d category. Applicant \nwas admitted to the hospital for observation until a bed became available at a mental \nhealth treatment facility. On April 14, 2008, a different LCSW evaluated Applicant, and she \ntoo certified him for emergency commitment to the first available acute-care psychiatric \nbed. (GE 24.) A toxicology screen of April 14, 2008, was positive for PCP and marijuana. \n(GE 23.) Applicant admitted he smoked marijuana daily, but that the PCP ingestion was \n\u201cprobably accidental,\u201d possibly due to his marijuana being laced or to using cough syrup a \ncouple of days before. (GEs 23, 24.) Applicant denied any alcohol use. (GE 23.) Applicant \n\n \n \n8 \nattributes his decompensation to \u201ca matter of the Invega working against the Risperdal\u201d in \nhis system. (Tr. 106.) \n \n \nFrom April 16, 2008, to April 18, 2008, Applicant was an inpatient at psychiatric \nfacility D, where he was diagnosed on admission with bipolar disorder with psychotic \nfeatures, cannabis dependence, and hallucinogen abuse. Applicant was discharged on \nEffexor XR, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Invega medications, to follow up with his private \npsychiatrist for treatment of diagnosed bipolar disorder, not otherwise specified. (GE 25.) \n \n \nOn September 5, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant disclosed his counseling with private \npsychiatrists since 1993 and his mental health hospitalizations in April 2008, March 2007, \nand April 2004. He added that he was continuing to abstain from alcohol. Concerning his \narrest record, Applicant reported his arrest on drug charges and for breach of peace in \nMarch 2007, for which he was fined $100 and ordered to complete drug education classes; \na charge of violating a no-contact order in November 2002, which was dismissed, and an \nOctober 1986 driving while intoxicated charge, also dismissed. Regarding any illegal drug \ninvolvement in the last seven years, Applicant indicated that he used marijuana \napproximately 20 times while possessing a security clearance from February 2007 to \nDecember 2007. (GE 1.) Applicant intentionally did not disclose the full extent of his \nmarijuana use. (Tr. 100.)  \n  \n \nOn October 28, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about his drug arrest in March 2007 and his \nuse of marijuana. Applicant reported that he appeared in court around May 2007 and pled \nguilty to one of the three charges. He claimed he could not recall which charge. Concerning \nhis illegal drug use, Applicant told the investigator he smoked marijuana from February \n2007 to December 2007 about 20 times, alone or with his son, who purchased the drug at \nleast once with money he provided. Applicant claimed that he tried marijuana as an \nexperiment, but decided it was not something that he wanted to continue. He denied any \ncurrent abuse of illegal drugs or any intent to use them in the future. Applicant admitted \nthat he used the marijuana while he held a DOD secret clearance, although he denied any \nadverse impact on his ability to maintain that clearance. Applicant denied any association \nwith anyone who continues to use illegal drugs, but for his son. Applicant claimed he was \nattempting to convince his son to stop using marijuana. Applicant denied he had ever had \na positive drug screen. On March 30, 2009, Applicant affirmed that his account to the OPM \ninvestigator about his marijuana use was accurate. (GE 7.)  \n \n \nIn June 2009, Applicant began treatment with a new psychiatrist. His former \npsychiatrist was placed on probation from September 15, 2009, to December 31, 2009, on \na complaint of negligence, and he was not to renew his license to practice medicine after \nDecember 31, 2009. (AE E.) So, Applicant\u2019s insurer was no longer willing to cover his \ntreatment with this psychiatrist. (Tr. 76.) Applicant\u2019s new psychiatrist, a doctor of \nosteopathy, continued to monitor and adjust the dosages of Applicant\u2019s medications as \nneeded. (GEs 8, 26; AE F.) In 2010, Applicant informed this psychiatrist that he was using \nmarijuana to self-medicate to overcome some of the side effects of his psychiatric \n\n \n \n9 \nmedications. The psychiatrist advised him to abstain from using illegal drugs, and he \ninstituted urinalysis testing around July 2010 \u201cto force [Applicant] to answer to [himself].\u201d \n(Tr. 80-81.) A drug screen of July 30, 2010, detected the presence of cannabis, although \nnot within a reportable range. Applicant submitted to four more tests over the next two \nmonths, and no drugs were detected. (GE 26.) \n \n \nOn June 28, 2010, Applicant detailed his involvement with illegal drugs at the \nrequest of DOHA. Concerning marijuana, he reported use three to four times a month from \n1984 to 1990; once to twice a day \u201cwith periods of discontinuance\u201d from 1990 to April 2007; \nand five times a week or less from April 2007 to April 2010. Applicant also disclosed use of \nmescaline once in July 1989 and possible use of PCP once in April 2008. His illegal drug \nuse caused loose associations among other effects. Applicant added that he sought \nprofessional treatment to help him with his commitment to stay drug free. He expressed his \nhope that his \u201cdishonesty, bad judgment, and procrastination has not cost [him] a satisfying \njob.\u201d (GE 9.) \n \n \nOn June 29, 2010, Applicant began counseling on a weekly basis with a licensed \nchemical dependency professional (LCDP) for substance abuse and mental health issues. \nApplicant relapsed into using marijuana in October 2010, which he attributed to extreme \nanxiety over a family issue. (GEs 10, 27; AE A.) Applicant told his treating LCDP that he \nrelapsed during the week of October 14-21, 2010. She assessed his prognosis as excellent \nas of mid-December 2010. In her opinion, Applicant did not have a condition that could \nimpair his judgment or reliability in the handling of classified information. On January 10, \n2011, the LCDP indicated that Applicant was repentant about his relapse and free of illicit \ndrugs since then. Applicant had made significant progress in his therapy sessions with her, \nand he was motivated to abstain from illegal drugs. (GE 27.) As of May 22, 2012, Applicant \nwas seeing this therapist once every two weeks. Applicant continued to report to the LCDP \nthat he had been abstinent from marijuana since October 22, 2010. In her opinion, \nApplicant was mentally stable, and he had a fair to good prognosis for remaining abstinent \nfrom marijuana. (AE A.) \n \n \nOn December 31, 2010, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated \nthat he had not consumed alcohol since about 1999 or when he made his statement. He \ndenied any intent to drink alcohol in the future. He answered affirmatively to whether he \nhad used an illegal drug since June 2010, and he disclosed that he used cannabis on \nOctober 9, 2010, and October 17, 2010 (GE 10), although he is now not sure whether that \nis accurate. (Tr. 98.) On April 20, 2011, in response to DOHA inquiry into any illegal drug \nuse since October 2010, Applicant reported that he used cannabis between November 2, \n2010 and November 30, 2010, \u201c1 time rolled.\u201d (GE 11.)  \n \n \nIn late November 2010, Applicant\u2019s current psychiatrist reported that Applicant was \ndoing \u201cmuch better.\u201d On April 21, 2011, he opined that Applicant did not have a condition \nthat could impair his judgment, reliability, or ability to properly safeguard classified \ninformation provided Applicant was taking his prescribed medications. He gave Applicant a \ngood prognosis. (GE 26.) As of June 2012, Applicant was seeing this psychiatrist once \nevery three months. (Tr. 105.) \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant attributes his manic episodes to the ineffectiveness of his psychiatric \nmedications, questioning in particular the long-term safety and effectiveness of Depakote \nfor managing bipolar disorder. He contends that he raised the issue repeatedly with the \npsychiatrist who treated him from December 2002 until June 2009. (Tr. 68.) Also, Applicant \nquestions the appropriateness of his current Effexor XR medication on the basis that the \ndrug has not been approved for bipolar disorder and has extensive side effects.5 (Tr. 69.) \nApplicant testified that the side effects of his medications increased gradually to where he \neventually experienced fatigue, somnolence, sedation, and Parkinsonism with the \nRisperdal and abnormal dreams, agitation, confusion, depression, hallucinations, and \nthinking abnormalities with the Depakote. (Tr. 71-72.) He indicated that he also had side \neffects from his Effexor XR and Lamictal, including confusion and depersonalization. (Tr. \n74.) Applicant has not been hospitalized for any mental health concerns since 2008, \nalthough he continues to experience some side effects from his psychiatric medications, \nincluding \u201ctrouble with memory\u201d and hearing voices when in very stressful situations. (Tr. \n103-04.) Applicant missed a nighttime dose of his medications one evening during the \nweek of May 27, 2012. (Tr. 105.) \n \n \nApplicant denies any use of marijuana since October or November 2010. (Tr. 81, 95, \n99.) Also, he denies knowing before he received the Directive that illegal drug use is \nprohibited while holding a security clearance. Applicant knew that it was illegal to use \nmarijuana. (Tr. 99.) Since 2010, Applicant has had impulses to use marijuana once every \ncouple of weeks. He deals with these recurring impulses by staying busy. (Tr. 110.)  \nApplicant thought about using marijuana when he received the SOR, but he overcame the \nimpulse by working on his response to the SOR. (Tr. 109-10.) Applicant has discussed the \nimpulses with his counselor, but not with his psychiatrist. The LCDP has told him to stop \nstressing over his son. (Tr. 111.) Applicant has not seen his son in three months. He \nbelieves his son is no longer using marijuana (Tr. 101), although Applicant\u2019s decision to \nstop using marijuana became an issue between them (\u201cBecause I stopped and he hadn\u2019t \nand he gave me the hypocritical thing there.\u201d). (Tr. 112.) Applicant\u2019s spouse credits \nApplicant with getting his son the professional help that his son needed to stop using \nmarijuana. (Tr. 143-44.) She believes Applicant smoked marijuana in the past with a former \nco-worker of his. (Tr. 142.) Applicant has smoked marijuana with his next-door neighbor in \nthe past. He has been staying away from him because he knows the neighbor still smokes \nthe drug. (Tr. 112-13.)  \n \n \nApplicant denies that he ever knowingly used any PCP. He attributes the positive \ndrug screen of April 2008 to his Effexor medication. (Tr. 78-80.) As of March 2012, the U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a supplement to the labeling for Effexor \n                                                 \n5The drug literature substantiates Applicant\u2019s concern. Effexor XR is approved for treatment of major \ndepressive disorder. It has not been approved for use in treating bipolar depression. The drug literature \nindicates that prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be \nadequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder because while not established in \ncontrolled trials, it is generally believed that treating an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the \nlikelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. (AE J.) \n\n \n \n11 \n(venlafaxine HCL) tablets and Effexor XE extended-relapse capsules to include the \nfollowing: \n \nDrug-Laboratory Test Interactions \nFalse positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) \nand amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine. This is \ndue to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results \nmay be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine \ntherapy. \nConfirmatory \ntests, \nsuch \nas \ngas \nchromatography/mass \nspectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine. (AEs \nC, J.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse began to notice some improvement in Applicant\u2019s mental health \na couple of years ago. (Tr. 123.) She is now able to talk Applicant out of a depressed state \nand persuade him to focus on the present, which she was unable to do previously, \nespecially when Applicant was on Depakote medication. (Tr. 146-47.) \n \n \nCharacter reference letters from coworkers familiar with Applicant\u2019s work \nperformance from 1995 to 2002 attest to Applicant\u2019s dependability, reliability, and high \npersonal integrity over that period. Applicant planned his time well and could be relied on to \naccomplish his assignments with little or no supervision. He was an excellent machinist, \nwho had a \u201cknack for making solutions to complicated problems clear to others and [had] \ngreat patience explaining tasks to those of lesser abilities.\u201d Applicant exhibited no rash or \nextreme behavior at the workplace. (AE N.) A coworker, who has known Applicant for more \nthan 15 years, describes Applicant as a \u201ccooperative person who extends himself to assist \nothers.\u201d Applicant completed the task of building a pipe-cutting and beveling machine on \ntime and under budget. (AE B.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n12 \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I\u2014Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified medical health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline. No negative inference concerning the standards in this Guideline \nmay be raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling. \n \n \nA diagnosis of bipolar disorder is not per se disqualifying, and no negative \ninferences are raised solely on the basis of counseling or medication management for the \ncondition. However, Guideline I concerns are raised when the mental health condition is \nnot adequately managed and results in behavior that casts doubt on judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. Applicant required treatment at a psychiatric facility in 1992 when, in a \nconfused state, he confronted the mother of his son at church services. In July 1996, he \nstopped taking his Depakote medication while on vacation. It led to assaultive, violent \nbehavior and eventual psychosis, necessitating his psychiatric hospitalization. After a \n\n \n \n13 \nperiod of mental health stability, he was disoriented at his work place in April 2004 after he \nhad stopped taking his Depakote medication, and he was readmitted to a psychiatric \nhospital. In March 2007, during a period of work stress, he had a hypomanic episode at a \ngas station and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital for five days. In \nDecember 2007, after not taking his psychiatric medications, Applicant became violent with \nhis spouse, and he appeared psychotic and disorganized (\u201ctalking nonsense\u201d) at the \nhospital. In April 2008, he had another episode of psychosis after his supply of Lamictal ran \nout. AG \u00b6 28(a), \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to \nemotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior,\u201d is \nestablished. \n \n \nApplicant attributes his episodes of dysfunctional behavior to the gradual \nineffectiveness of certain psychiatric medications and extensive side effects of the various \ndrugs. He questions in particular the long-term safety of Depakote for managing his bipolar \ndisorder, and the fact that Effexor XR, which he has taken since March 2007, has not been \napproved for treatment of bipolar disorder. The drug literature supports his position to the \nextent that Effexor XR has not been approved for treatment of bipolar depression, although \nthe clinical concern appears to be treating bipolar disorder with Effexor XR alone. Applicant \nsuffers from a chronic mental health condition that may require changes in medication or \ndosages for effective management. He has been prescribed an antipsychotic (initially \nRisperdal and more recently Invega) to manage the mania associated with bipolar disorder, \nin addition to antidepressants. I am not in a position to question the appropriateness of the \ntreatment protocol prescribed by medically-qualified providers. The exacerbations of his \nmental illness followed his failure to take the prescribed psychiatric medications Depakote \nin 1996 and 2002, and Lamictal in 2008. While Applicant may have missed doses of his \npsychiatric medications at times due to confusion or lack of routine, he allowed his supply \nof Lamictal to run out in 2008. Also, he continued to smoke marijuana until the fall of 2010, \nand to drink alcohol until at least 2007, after being advised that the substances could \nreduce the effectiveness of his psychiatric medications. AG \u00b6 28(c), \u201cthe individual has \nfailed to follow treatment advice related to a diagnosed emotional, mental, or personality \ncondition, e.g., failure to take prescribed medication,\u201d is established. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d is not met, despite his history of episodic, unstable behavior. \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist opined in April 2011 that Applicant did not have a condition \nthat could impair his judgment, reliability, or ability to properly safeguard classified national \nsecurity information \u201cwhile taking prescribed medication.\u201d  In May 2012, the LCDP, who has \ncounseled him since June 2010, assessed his mental health condition as stable. The \nevidence substantiates that Applicant\u2019s diagnosed bipolar disorder does not sufficiently \nimpair his judgment, provided he is complying with his treatment. \n \n \nApplicant satisfies the first component of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 29(a), \u201cthe \nidentified condition is readily controllable with treatment.\u201d Yet, his erratic compliance with \nhis treatment has had negative consequences for his judgment and reliability, and it \n\n \n \n14 \nprecludes full application of AG \u00b6 29(a), which also requires that \u201cthe individual has \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist gave him a good prognosis in April 2011, and his \ntherapist considers his present mental health to be stable. The favorable prognosis from \nthe psychiatrist implicates AG \u00b6 29(b), \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a counseling \nor treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmental health professional,\u201d but it was contingent on Applicant taking his medications as \nprescribed. Applicant and his spouse have noticed improvement in his mental state under \nhis current medication regimen. Yet, previous medications like Risperdal and Depakote \nwere initially successful in managing his condition only to become less effective over time. \nFurthermore, Applicant admits that he missed a dose of his psychiatric medications within \na week of his security clearance hearing. His relapse history is difficult to overcome without \na recent assessment by a qualified mental health professional that his condition has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation despite missing doses of his medication, and \nrecurrent impulses to use marijuana. Applicant\u2019s therapist considers Applicant\u2019s present \nmental health to be stable, but her expertise is in substance abuse issues. The \npsychological conditions security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline G\u2014Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant drank alcohol against therapeutic advice, knowing that it could \nimpair the effectiveness of the prescription medications needed to adequately manage his \nbipolar disorder. He was diagnosed with alcohol abuse-episodic when hospitalized \nfollowing the incident at the motel in 1996. Applicant had consumed beer while on \nvacation, and he attributes his agitated and incoherent state to alcohol interfering with his \nmedications. However, his confused mental state was more likely caused by his failure to \ntake his prescribed psychiatric medication for a few days. Between November 1999 and \nSeptember 2000, Applicant drank four or five beers at bars after work before driving home, \nresulting in diminished effectiveness of at least one of his psychiatric medications. At \nDOHA\u2019s request, Applicant underwent a substance abuse evaluation in February 2002 by a \nPhD and LCSW-credentialed senior clinician affiliated with a substance abuse treatment \nfacility. This substance abuse professional found no indication of a current alcohol \ndependency or alcohol abuse problem. Applicant acknowledged during his psychiatric \nhospitalization in March 2007 that he was using alcohol occasionally, despite knowing that \nit could interfere with his mental health, and his spouse suspected in December 2007 that \nalcohol played a role in his violent behavior, although Applicant denied he had been \ndrinking. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependence,\u201d has limited applicability to Applicant\u2019s drinking between 1999 and \n\n \n \n15 \n2000, when he was consuming up to five 12-ounce beers at bars after work before going \nhome. To the extent that AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram,\u201d are established because Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse, mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \n \nApplicant told DOHA in March 2002 that he had chosen to cease his alcohol \nconsumption  because he realized that the interaction between alcohol and his prescribed \npsychiatric medications could result in unacceptable behavior. He drank occasionally until \nat least March 2007, in contravention of medical advice, but not to intoxication. However, \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol for long enough to apply AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time \nhas passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant denies he had an alcohol problem, \nalthough he recognizes that alcohol could impair the effectiveness of his psychiatric \nmedications, and he had stopped drinking as a result. So, there is a basis to apply AG \u00b6 \n23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d The \nalcohol consumption issues are mitigated because he is not likely to abuse alcohol in the \nfuture. \n \nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 24(a), drugs are defined as \u201cmood and behavior altering substances,\u201d \nand include: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens),6 and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 24(b), drug abuse is defined as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a \nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d Potentially \n                                                 \n6Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V of the Controlled Substances Act, are set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). \n\n \n \n16 \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession \nof drug paraphernalia,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance,\u201d apply. Applicant abused marijuana with varying frequency from about 1983 to \nNovember 2010. He also purchased marijuana on occasion. Applicant abstained from \nmarijuana for six months from 2001 into 2002, but he resumed smoking after he was \ngranted his secret clearance. Applicant had marijuana and a wooden pipe for smoking in \nhis possession in March 2007. Applicant was arrested on drug charges and then taken to \nthe emergency room due to his bizarre behavior. He was abusing the drug at the time of \nhis psychiatric break in April 2008, and he relapsed in 2010. \n \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana in March 2007. During his psychiatric \nadmission in December 2007, a urine sample was positive for marijuana and PCP. A \ntoxicology screen of April 14, 2008, submitted while he was under evaluation for \nemergency commitment to a mental health bed, was positive for marijuana and PCP. AG \u00b6 \n25(b), \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use,\u201d was not alleged as a basis for disqualification, \nalthough the drug screens are still relevant in that they confirm his use of marijuana. The \nevidence falls short of establishing that he knowingly abused PCP. The FDA recently \napproved supplemental labeling for Effexor XR to warn of false-positive urine \nimmunoassay screening tests for PCP and amphetamine for patients taking Effexor. \nApplicant had been on Effexor XR since March 2007, so the possibility of a false positive \ncannot be discounted. A more recent drug screen in July 2010 detected marijuana but no \nother illegal drug. Applicant\u2019s abuse of other controlled dangerous substances was limited \nto one-time mescaline use in July 1989. \n \nAG \u00b6 25(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence,\u201d is satisfied as \nwell. Medical records from his psychiatric admission in December 2007 indicate that he \nwas diagnosed with marijuana abuse, in addition to bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse. On \nhis admission to another psychiatric facility in April 2008, he was diagnosed with bipolar \ndisorder, cannabis dependence, and hallucinogen abuse, although the psychiatrist who \nevaluated him at the facility listed only the bipolar disorder as his primary diagnosis. \n \nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 26(a) \u201cthe behavior happened \nso long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d is difficult to apply. Applicant abused marijuana for about 27 years, despite \nbeing told that it could compromise his mental stability. The frequency of his marijuana \nabuse increased from twice weekly as of March 2007 to daily as of April 2008, after he was \nsentenced for marijuana possession, and his spouse expressed concerns about his drug \nabuse and the need to set a good example for his son. While in counseling with the LCDP, \nand after urinalysis testing was instituted to \u201cforce him to answer to [himself],\u201d Applicant \nabused marijuana in October 2010 and November 2010.7  \n                                                 \n7Applicant told his LCDP that he relapsed from October 14-21, 2010, and that he has been free of marijuana \nsince October 22, 2010. (AE A.) On December 31, 2010, he told DOHA that he used marijuana since June \n2010: on October 9, 2010, and again on October 17, 2010. (GE 10.) On April 20, 2011, Applicant indicated \n\n \n \n17 \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the \nfuture,\u201d can be shown by \u201c(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of \nabstinence; or (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation.\u201d Applicant told an OPM investigator in October 2008 that he had stopped \nusing marijuana in December 2007 and did not intend to continue illegal drug use. Yet, in \n2009, he indicated that he smoked marijuana \u201c5 times a week or less\u201d from April 2007 to \nApril 2010. He abused marijuana well after he claimed to have stopped. Given his many \nyears of marijuana abuse, and his previous lack of candor about his illegal drug \ninvolvement, it is difficult to apply AG \u00b6 26(b) without substantial evidence corroborating his \nintent not to abuse marijuana in the future. Applicant\u2019s counseling with the LCDP since \nJune 2010 weighs in his favor in assessing his commitment to abstain. That said, the \ncounselor reports that Applicant has abstained since October 22, 2010. Applicant appears \nnot to have shared with his therapist that he used marijuana at least once after October \n2010. Applicant\u2019s spouse is persuaded that he no longer uses marijuana, but she appears \nnot to know the full extent of his marijuana involvement. She believes that Applicant used \nmarijuana with only one friend, a former co-worker, while Applicant admits that he smoked \nthe drug with his son and with his next-door neighbor. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s spouse \ntestified that her stepson has \u201ccome clean\u201d (i.e., stopped his drug use) with Applicant\u2019s \nhelp, while Applicant testified that his decision to stop smoking marijuana caused him to \nbecome estranged from his son, who accused him of being hypocritical. Even if I accept \nthat Applicant is no longer associating with his neighbor, and that he intends no future \ninvolvement, a lengthier period of abstention is needed to fully satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b) in his \ncase. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of \nabuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional,\u201d is minimally \nestablished. Applicant is still in counseling every two weeks with the LCDP, who assessed \nhis prognosis for remaining abstinent as fair to good. It is unclear whether she knows about \nhis recurrent impulses to use marijuana. The drug involvement concerns are not fully \nmitigated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthat he used marijuana one time since October 2010:  one time from November 1-30, 2010. (GE 11.) \n  \n\n \n \n18 \n \n \nThe Government established its Guideline E case in that Applicant exercised poor \njudgment by abusing marijuana and alcohol knowing that it could impair the effectiveness \nof his psychiatric medications. Applicant\u2019s repeated disregard of therapeutic advice not to \ndrink alcohol or use marijuana primarily implicates AG \u00b6 16(c): \n \nCredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. \n \n \nAs for him abusing marijuana while holding a secret clearance, Applicant claims he \ndid not understand that marijuana use was contrary to his security responsibilities. At the \nsame time, Applicant admits that he knew it was illegal to use marijuana. Applicant cannot \nreasonably claim that he failed to realize that marijuana use was inconsistent with security \nrequirements. He falsely denied any illegal drug use on his February 2000 and February \n2006 security clearance applications. On his September 2008 e-QIP, he reported only his \nmarijuana abuse from February 2007 to December 2007. This misrepresentation of his \nillegal drug involvement was repeated during his October 2008 interview. Applicant\u2019s \ndishonesty is conduct contemplated within AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cDeliberate omission, concealment \nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d) and AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d). \nThe Government did not allege lack of candor as an issue of security concern under \nGuideline E,8 although it is relevant to Applicant\u2019s security suitability. Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance implicates AG \u00b6 16(e): \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n                                                 \n8In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. \n24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR misconduct for the five above purposes, and not for any other \npurpose. \n \n\n \n \n19 \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant continued to abuse marijuana from March 2002 until November 2010 in \ndisregard of its illegality and of his security responsibilities, and despite knowing it was \ncontraindicated for his psychiatric medications. It is too serious and repeated to be \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d even if his alcohol abuse against medical advice is now mitigated by the \npassage of time. Applicant\u2019s ongoing counseling with the LCDP since late June 2010 \nwarrants some consideration of AG \u00b6 17(d): \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant sees his therapist every other week and his psychiatrist once every three months. \nHis therapist has given him a fair to good prognosis for remaining abstinent from \nmarijuana. While Applicant is making constructive use of his time through home \nimprovements projects, he continues to experience anxiety over family matters and \nimpulses to abuse marijuana. Especially in light of his history, I cannot safely conclude that \nhis marijuana use is safely behind him, so AG \u00b6 17(d) does not fully apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d applies in part, in that the \nGovernment is now aware that Applicant used marijuana at risk to his mental health and to \nnational security interests. However, the evidence also shows that Applicant has not been \nfully frank with his spouse about his marijuana involvement. Moreover, it is unclear whether \nany of his character references is aware of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse. AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe \ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d applies only in \nthat the Government failed to establish that Applicant knowingly abused PCP in \ncontravention of medical advice at risk to the effectiveness of his psychiatric medications or \nDOD security clearance requirements. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a).9 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(c), I have \n                                                 \n9The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \n\n \n \n20 \nto consider that certain medications may be less effective over time in managing his bipolar \ndisorder. Admissions of drug and alcohol abuse from Applicant when he was in a manic or \npsychotic state are potentially suspect in light of his compromised mental health. That \nbeing said, Applicant knowingly used marijuana and alcohol after being told that such \nmood-altering substances could impair the effectiveness of his psychiatric medications. He \ncontinued to smoke marijuana despite his spouse\u2019s expressed approval. While he may not \nhave been aware of a specific DOD policy against illicit substance use, he certainly \nsuspected that it would not be condoned because he concealed his abuse when he applied \nfor his security clearance. Applicant\u2019s ongoing counseling with the LCDP is a very \nimportant step in reform, but given his history of erratic compliance with his mental health \ntreatment and his many years of marijuana abuse, I cannot conclude that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n \n21 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The case\nwas assigned to me on September 27, 2010, and was scheduled for hearing on October\n27, 2010. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nJanuary 24, 2011\n\n2\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of seven exhibits (GEs 1 through 7); Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand two  exhibits (AEs A-B). The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 12, 2010. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested and charged on\nmultiple occasions between January 2000 and July 2005 for assorted traffic-related\noffenses, including recurrent incidents of driving on a suspended license and failure to\nappear in noticed court hearings.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified material facts in a\nNovember 20, 2007 security clearance application (SF-86) by omitting his arrest, charge,\nand conviction history when asked to reply to question 23 (police record) of the\napplication.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covering his\nalleged arrests and his SF-86 omissions. He provided an explanation for each of his\nanswers. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old electronic technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant experienced a difficult childhood. He admits to having a \u201cwise mouth\u201d\nwhen he was younger, and to hanging around with \u201ca rough crowd.\u201d (GE 4) He has post-\nhigh school college education credits. He attended an accredited technical institute\nbetween September 2002 and September 2004 and earned an Associate\u2019s degree. (see\nGE 1)\nApplicant is unmarried and has one child (age 4) from his current relationship.\n(GE 1) He has never served in the military service of the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest history\nWhile in high school, Applicant was often stopped by police and questioned. (GE\n1) Between July 2001 and July 2005 he was arrested on numerous occasions (13 in all)\nfor assorted traffic and alcohol-related offenses. Police and court records document\nApplicant\u2019s being charged in January 2000 for letting an unlicensed minor drive. (GE 6)\nPolice transported him to a juvenile detention center, where they processed him and\nreleased him. (GE 6; Tr. 24). The following year (2001) he was twice arrested for traffic-\nrelated violations. In his July 2001 arrest, police charged him with concealing identity,\n\n3\nfailure to obey a notice to appear, driving on a suspended license, failure to obey notices\nto appear, and speeding. He pleaded to concealing his identity, and the remaining\ncounts were dismissed. Three months later (in September 2001), he was arrested again,\nthis time for a false report for citation, driving on a suspended license, license carry and\nexhibit on demand, and headlamps for motor vehicles (GEs 4 and 7).  Applicant pleaded\nguilty to driving on a suspended license, and the other counts were dismissed. (GE 7)\nApplicant was twice arrested in 2002 as well. In March 2002, he was charged with\nconcealing identity, driving on a suspended license, improper use of evidence of\nregistration, a temporary registration violation, and failure to appear. Applicant pled guilty\nto driving on a suspended license, temporary registration not visible, and failure to\nappear. (GE 7)  In June 2002, he was charged with open container and was fined. (GE\n7)\nIn February 2003, Applicant was charged with criminal trespass. (GE 7) The\ncharge was dismissed. In April of 2003, he was charged with driving on a revoked\nlicense and a temporary registration visible left rear window violation. Both of these\ncharges were dismissed. (GE 7)\nRecords document that Applicant was separately charged on three occasions in\n2004.  In June 2004, he was charged with an open container violation and paid a fine.\n(GE 7) Two months later (in August 2004) he was charged with driving on a revoked\nlicense, deficient windshield wipers (window side), and speeding. (GE) Applicant pled\nguilty to no driver\u2019s license and was sentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended) and fined.\nAnd in October 2004, he was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor (a\nfelony). This charge was nolle prossed. (GE 7)  \nApplicant was charged with driving on a revoked license on three more occasions\nin 2005.  In January 2005 and July 2005, charges of driving on a revoked license were\ndismissed. (GE 7) He pleaded guilty, though to driving on a revoked license in March\n2005 and was fined.  (GE 7) Since his last traffic-related conviction in July 2005,\nApplicant has not encountered any additional confrontations with law enforcement\nofficers. (see GEs 4 and 7; Tr. 26)  He claims to have turned his life around and no\nlonger engages in the type of conduct that exposed him to risks of arrest for traffic-\nrelated offenses. (GE 4)\nApplicant\u2019s E-Qip and OPM interview omissions \nAsked to complete a security clearance application (E-QIP) on November 20,\n2007, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23, which inquired about his police and judicial\nrecord. The question specifically asked to list any arrests, charges, and convictions within\nthe previous seven years (save for offenses that involved traffic fines of less than $150).\nIn answering in the negative, he omitted all of his arrests that occurred between July 2001\nand July 2005. Some of these arrests resulted in jail sentences and imposed fines in\nexcess of $150. (see GE 7) \n\n4\nApplicant attributed his omissions to (a) uncertainty over whether listing the\noffenses was important, given that his omitted offenses involved only traffic offenses and\na contributing to the delinquency of a minor charge (subparagraph 1.j) that was dismissed\nand (b) confusion over whether he needed to list a felony arrest (covered by\nsubparagraph j) that did not include a conviction. (see GE 4; Tr. 27-32) Applicant\u2019s\nconfusion claims are not well corroborated by the court documentation in the record. \nIn both his OPM interview and his SOR response, Applicant admitted to\nintentionally omitting his listed arrests in his E-QIP.  In neither the summary of interview\nnor his SOR response did Applicant make any manifest attempt to identify and explain the\nsource of his confusion.  Afforded an opportunity to provide more detailed explanations of\nhis claimed confusion over question 23 in his hearing testimony, Applicant failed to do so.\n(Tr. 27-32)  Close review of court records reveals that several of the covered arrests\ninvolving driving on a suspended license and resulted in imposed fines of $150 and\nabove, and in a few instances, jail time. (see GEs 6 and 7)\nMost of Applicant\u2019s covered arrests in the SOR include driving on a suspended\nlicence charge, which facially, at least, reflect charges that carry potential jail time and\nfines exceeding $150 on conviction. (see exhibits 3, 4, and 7)  Before responding to the\nE-QIP, Applicant made no tangible attempt to match the offenses with the punishment\nand fines imposed. (see GE 4; Tr. 42-43)  Without more detailed explanations of why he\nprovided a negative answer to question 23 without any attempt to provide explanations or\nqualifications in the comment section of the E-QIP, Applicant cannot avert drawn\ninferences that he falsely omitted all of his listed arrests out of concern that his\ndisclosures could adversely affect his job and security clearance. \nIn October 2008, an agent from OPM scheduled an interview with Applicant to\ndiscuss his 2007 E-QIP answers. (GE 4).  The summary of interview produced from OPM\ndocuments Applicant\u2019s being contacted by the OPM agent for the specific purpose of\ndiscussing his omitted arrests and convictions. When asked about his arrest history,\nApplicant assured he did not list the arrests because he considered them old traffic\noffenses that had been resolved. (GE 4). Applicant\u2019s explanations do not reflect prompt,\nvoluntary disclosures of his arrest history to the interviewing OPM agent.\nEndorsements \nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisor and coworkers. His supervisor and\ncoworker both describe him as a productive and dependable performer. (see AE A)  His\nfurnished credit report documents a good payment record with his creditors. (AE B)  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\n\n5\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be considered before deciding\nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The\nguidelines do not require administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in\naccordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) of\nthe revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a\nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG, \u00b6 30.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\n\n6\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a dependable technician for his defense contractor who presents with\na considerable history of assorted arrests and convictions (mostly traffic-related) over a\nfive-year period. Principal security issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s history\nof arrests that entail repeated driving on a suspended license charges, and his\nunqualified omissions of his arrests in the E-QIP he completed in November 2007. \nCriminal arrest issues\nApplicant\u2019s arrests and convictions, while mostly traffic-related, involve numerous\noffenses of driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license.  Altogether, Applicant was arrested\non 13 separate occasions between 2000 and 2005 and was found guilty on eight\noccasions. \nApplicable disqualifying conditions under the criminal conduct guideline include\nDC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(c),\n\n7\n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecute or convicted.\u201d\nSince July 2005, Applicant has not been involved in any arrest incidents. He has\navoided any incidents with law enforcement since his last reported arrest of July 2005,\nand shows added growth and maturity in his professional and personal relationships. \nWithout any evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s explanations of the underlying\nevents and circumstances surrounding his various arrests and convictions, his\ndemonstrated steady restorative progress since his last arrest in 2005 are entitled to\nconsiderable weight.  In turn, the criminal conduct concerns that are based on his history\nof recurrent arrests between 2000 and 2005 are entitled to  mitigation credit. \nApplicant may rely on MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s prior arrests and convictions are currently aged and are\noutweighed by his substantial showing of good judgment and trust demonstrated with his\ncivilian employer, and strengthened personal relationship with his fianc\u00e9e over the past\nfive years. Applicant has also established himself to be a responsible parent of his son.  \n Based on his own rehabilitative efforts to date that include encouraging\ncontributions to his employer and changes in his family environment, the chances of any\nrecurrent arrests are unlikely. Applicant may take advantage of MC \u00b6 32(d) of the\ncriminal conduct guideline, \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d\nBoth from a consideration of the applicable guidelines, and from a whole-person\nperspective, Applicant demonstrates he  possesses the strength of overall character and\nrehabilitation to meet all of the minimum requirements under the criminal conduct\nguideline for continued eligibility to hold a security clearance. Based on the confluence of\ncorrective steps he has taken to date, he persuasively demonstrates that he has learned\nimportant lessons from his unfortunate lapses in judgment and will work earnestly to\navoid any recurrence. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances developed\nin the record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m of the SOR.\nPersonal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nraised under Guideline E as the result of his omissions of his numerous arrests and\nconvictions in the E-QIP he completed in November 2007.  By omitting his arrests and\ncharges (regardless of disposition), Applicant failed to furnish materially important\nbackground information about his arrest history that was needed for the Government to\n\n8\nproperly process and evaluate his security clearance application.  DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts to any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations of his omissions are not fully reconcilable with the arrests\nand convictions themselves, or with the explanations he provided the OPM agent who\ninterviewed him in October 2008. While some of the arrests might have yielded fines\nunder $150, others resulted in fines exceeding $150. And all of Applicant\u2019s arrests and\ncharges involving driving on a suspended license were serious enough to carry the\npotential for fines in excess of $150, or jail time. That most of the incidents might be a\nlittle aged and resolved (Applicant\u2019s OPM explanation) did not excuse him from listing\nthem when asked to do so in his E-QIP.\nFurther, Applicant may not be credited with any prompt, good-faith corrections of\nhis arrest omissions. Close examination of the 2008 summary of interview reveals that\nthe OPM agent contacted Applicant in October 2008 (almost a year after Applicant\ncompleted his E-QIP) for the specific purpose of discussing his omitted arrests and\nconvictions. Applicant\u2019s explanations of his arrests and convictions followed specific\nquestions asked of him by the investigator. \nSummarized, Applicant\u2019s answers to questions posed by the OPM agent who\ninterviewed him in 2008 were not sufficiently prompt, or voluntary, to enable him to\ninvoke MC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s corrections, while manifestly forthcoming and sincere, do not meet either the\nprompt or good-faith prongs of MC \u00b6 17(a), as these terms are generally understood in\nthe Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 02-30369 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 27,\n2006) (sustaining denial of security clearance); ISCR Case No. 04-00789 at 7 (App. Bd.\nJune 28, 2006) (reversing grant of security clearance); ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 4\n(App. Bd. July 10, 2000) (reversing grant of security clearance).\nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s E-QIP omissions,\nhis ensuing corrections, his explanations, and whole-person considerations, his\ndisclosures are insufficient to enable him to convincingly refute or mitigate the deliberate\nfalsification allegations. Questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, security concerns are each core\npolicy concerns of the personal conduct guideline (AG \u00b6 15). They are clearly evident\nunder the facts and policy considerations developed under this Guideline. Overall,\nApplicant\u2019s explanations are not persuasive enough to warrant conclusions that the\nfalsification allegations relative to his E-QIP omissions of his traffic-related arrests and\nconvictions are mitigated. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by Guideline E. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\n   \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\n   FOR APPLICANT\nSubparas. 1.a through 1.m:                        For Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):            AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara 2.a \n  Against Applicant \n           \n          \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Joseph Egan, Jr., Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), on \nJuly 11, 2006. On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, to Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 24, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 1, \n2009. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, a Notice of \nHearing was issued scheduling the hearing for June 16, 2009. The hearing was held, as \nscheduled. During the hearing, it was discovered Applicant did not receive the Notice of \nHearing 15 days prior to the date of the hearing as required by the Directive. Applicant \nwaived the 15-day notice requirement. (Tr at 8) The Government offered three exhibits \nJuly 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwhich were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 3 without objection. The \nApplicant offered three exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - C. \nDepartment Counsel objected to two of the character letters that were included in AE B \nbecause they were not signed. One of the authors of the letters also testified and \nverified that the letter was written by him. The record was left open for two weeks for \nApplicant to submit a signed copy of the other character letter. He timely submitted a \ntwo-page document which was marked as AE D. Applicant testified and called four \nwitnesses. The transcript was received on June 24, 2009. The record closed on July 1, \n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He is a calibration technician and has worked for his \ncurrent employer since February 2000. (Several defense contractors have successfully \nbid on the contract over the years but the employees have remained the same.) \nApplicant grew up in a military family. He enlisted in the United States Navy on February \n1, 1978. After serving over 18 years on active duty, he applied for early retirement. He \nretired from the United States Navy as an E-6 on October 31, 1996.  After his retirement \nfrom the United States Navy, he worked several jobs prior to accepting his current \nposition. He has been married for 30 years. He and his wife have three children. Their \noldest son passed away, which was the main reason for his early retirement from the \nUnited States Navy. Their two other sons are ages 26 and 27. (Tr at 72 - 79; Gov 1; AE \nA)   \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was younger. He drank alcohol while \nin the United States Navy. He admits to occasionally drinking to intoxication. He has \nnever experienced a black out after drinking alcohol. He has never craved alcohol. He \nhas never felt the need to drink alcohol in the morning after drinking alcohol the night \nbefore. He has never thrown up from drinking too much alcohol. He has never been \ndiagnosed or characterized as someone with an alcohol problem. (Tr at 79, 90, 111)  \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence and Careless Driving. He was found guilty of Driving Under the Influence. On \nthe night in question, Applicant and his wife had a couple drinks at two bars that were \nlocated not far from where they live. Applicant recalls drinking two or three drinks at the \nfirst bar. They went to another bar and shared about \u00bd pitcher of beer. While driving \nhome, Applicant started to turn left onto the wrong road but corrected himself prior to \ncompleting the turn. A police car pulled him over. Upon approaching his car, the police \nofficer smelled alcohol on his breath and gave him a breathalyzer test. He registered a \n0.12. (Tr at 84, 117)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn June 4, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence, Refuse Breath/Urine Test After Previous Misdemeanor, and Failure to Use a \nDesignated Lane. He was found guilty of Reckless Driving. Applicant\u2019s license was \nsuspended. He paid fines and court costs. Prior to his court date, he voluntarily entered \ncounseling classes and attended AA meetings. (Tr at 85-88, 95, 109-110, 117; Gov 1, \nquestion 23; Gov 2; Gov 3) \n \nOn the day of the arrest on June 4, 2006, Applicant and his wife spent the day at \nthe local American Legion post. He was an officer. They were nominating a new \ncommander. He and his wife planned to stay until the bartender closed down so that \nshe would not have to leave by herself. Another customer came in so Applicant decided \nto drive home. He had about three or four drinks during the time he was there. He was \npulled over by the police on the way home for activating his turn signal too early. The \npolice officer smelled alcohol on his breath. Applicant refused to take a breathalyzer or \na field sobriety test. He was subsequently arrested. (Tr at 85; Gov 2)  \n \nApplicant reported his two arrests for DUI to his supervisor the next time he came \nin for work. He listed the two DUI arrests on his security clearance questionnaire. He did \nnot try to hide the DUI arrests. (Tr at 106; Gov 1, section 23)  \n \nApplicant states the second DUI arrest was a signal to him that he needed to \nchange his life. He decided that he could not go through another DUI arrest. He \noccasionally drinks alcohol but never drinks and drives. He does not drink to excess. \nHis definition of drinking to excess is drinking more than three or four drinks in one \nsitting. He drinks once or twice a month at the American Legion or the VFW post. He \noccasionally drinks non-alcoholic beer. (Tr at 87-94)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified, \u201cI\u2019ve got a noose around my neck and I \nknow it and I\u2019m the only one with my hand on the trap door.\u201d (Tr at 111) His experience \nwith the DUI arrests and his attendance at AA meetings showed him how alcohol can \nadversely affect a person\u2019s life. He would never do anything to harm this country (United \nStates of America). (Tr at 111-112) \n \nFour of Applicant\u2019s colleagues took time off from work to testify on his behalf.  \nThe Business Manager and CEO of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \ntestified. He is on leave from the company where Applicant works. When not serving in \nhis union position, he is a metrologist. Metrology is the field of measurement, test \nequipment, and calibration. He used to be Applicant\u2019s lead prior to departing for the \nunion job. He states Applicant was hired 10 years ago. Applicant\u2019s job requires being \nvery meticulous and demands a very technical type of analytical thinking. He states \nApplicant is an excellent worker. He is very dependable. He does not believe Applicant \nis an alcohol abuser. Although he does not socialize with him outside of work, he has \nnever seen him intoxicated. He has never smelled alcohol on his breath. He never \nobserved him to be affected from drinking alcohol at work. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s \ntwo DUIs. (Tr at 25 \u2013 33) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnother co-worker, a calibration specialist, has known Applicant for seven years. \nHe and Applicant are co-workers. He works down the hall from Applicant. They see \neach other on a daily basis.  Each time Applicant was arrested for DUI, he told his co-\nworkers that he was arrested within the next work day.  Applicant was not secretive \nabout his DUI arrests.  Applicant\u2019s reputation pertaining to his technical skills, as well his \nhonesty and integrity are impeccable. Applicant is always working. He never complains. \nHe never has observed Applicant to be under the influence of alcohol in the work place. \nThe co-worker and Applicant do not socialize much outside of work because the co-\nworker lives 40 miles away from work. (Tr at 35-44) \n \nThe Calibration Support Coordinator testified that Applicant is a very hard worker. \nApplicant is honest and straight-forward. He is a good technician who is very well liked. \nHe interacts well with others and is ethical. The Calibration Support Coordinator is \naware of Applicant\u2019s two DUIs. He occasionally socializes with Applicant outside of \nwork. He has never observed Applicant being drunk or out of control.  He is aware that \nApplicant volunteers with Toys for Tots. (Tr at 50-56) \n \nMr. A., a metrologist, has a direct working relationship with Applicant. Mr. A. has \nknown Applicant for seven years. They work the same shift and interact with each other \ndaily. Applicant cares about the work. He has never had any concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nwork performance over the past six years. He has never noticed Applicant under the \ninfluence of alcohol on the job. If he had noticed that Applicant was impaired by alcohol, \nhe would have notified management because they cannot afford to have an employee \nbe impaired in their line of work. After Applicant\u2019s second DUI, he noticed Applicant was \ndisappointed in himself, and fearful as to how his second DUI arrest would affect his \nability to work. He was aware that as part of his DUI punishment, Applicant lost his \nlicense for a year. He never saw Applicant drive during that period. During the period \nthat Applicant\u2019s license was suspended, a co-worker drove him to work. (Tr at 58-72) \n \nThe people who wrote reference letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf say similar \nfavorable things about Applicant. They attest to his honesty and work ethic. (AE B and \nAE D) Recently, Applicant attempted to rescue an elderly woman from a house fire. She \nlived about three doors down from Applicant. Applicant and his son noticed her house \nwas on fire. Applicant\u2019s son called 911 and Applicant crawled into the house. He tried to \nget to his neighbor who was in a bedroom. He eventually had to turn back due to the \nflames and smoke. His neighbor died of smoke inhalation. (Tr at 113-115)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s awards and decorations from his active duty service include: Master \nTraining Specialist, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (4 devices); National Defense \nService Medal (1 device); Navy Achievement Medal (2 devices); Good Conduct Award \n(4 devices); Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist; and the Meritorious Unit \nCommendation. (AE A) \n \nIn his spare time, Applicant volunteers at the American Legion and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars (VFW). He is an avid motorcyclist. He is the Safety Officer for the \nAmerican Legion Riders. His volunteer activities include raising funds for Meals on \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWheels and Toys for Tots. He also volunteers for an organization called The River Rats \nwhich is an organization that provides help and support to military veterans. (Tr at 82, \n115-116; AE B at 5) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The following Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) is \nrelevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAC DC \u00b622(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s two DUI arrests in \nOctober 2003 and June 2006.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. The following Alcohol Consumption \nMitigating Condition (AC MC) is relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAC MC \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \napplies. While security concerns were raised as a result of two DUI arrests within a \nthree-year period, Applicant has mitigated the concern. He fully disclosed his two \narrests to his supervisor shortly after the arrest. He is open and forthcoming about the \narrests. He completed the terms of his court sentence for both arrests. The second DUI \nclearly affected Applicant. Although he still occasionally drinks a moderate amount of \nalcohol, he refuses to drive when he does drink alcohol. The record contains no \nevidence that he was diagnosed as an alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. \nNumerous co-workers testified or wrote letters on his behalf attesting to his honesty and \nwork ethic. Most of them also indicated that they have never observed Applicant under \nthe influence or impaired by alcohol. Applicant has learned his lesson. For the past \nthree years, he has had no alcohol-related incidents. Future incidents are unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant\u2019s past DUIs, while serious, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness or good judgment.    \n \nGuideline G is found for Applicant.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nservice with the United States Navy. I considered his favorable employment history after \nhis retirement from the military. Applicant is highly thought of by his superiors, co-\nworkers, and peers. In his spare time, he volunteers within the community. While \nApplicant\u2019s two DUIs raised some warning signs, Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony \nat hearing indicates that he has learned a grave lesson about drinking and driving. He \ndid not attempt to hide his DUI arrests from his employer. His current level of alcohol \nuse does not raise a concern that he is an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. Though \nhe occasionally drinks alcohol, he refuses to drive after drinking. He is aware that a \nfuture DUI arrest could jeopardize his ability to maintain a security clearance and \npossibly his job. Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, is found for Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of alcohol consumption. Although he was only \nconvicted of one charge of driving while intoxicated (DWI), he had alcohol-related \narrests or accidents in 1972, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2007, and 2008. He received 13 hours \nof alcohol-related evaluation and counseling in 2007. In 1998, Applicant was convicted \nof possession of a concealed firearm. Applicant mitigated security concerns arising from \nhis criminal conduct; however, he did not mitigate alcohol consumption concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 19, 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(2002 SF-86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 2) On October 5, 2008, Applicant submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (2008 SF-86). (GE 1) On \nAugust 6, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended and modified; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005. \n  \nJuly 15, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) \nand J (criminal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 27, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On February 28, 2010, \nDepartment Counsel announced he was ready to proceed on his case. On March 12, \n2010, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On April 16, 2010, DOHA issued a \nhearing notice setting the hearing for May 3, 2010. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held \non May 3, 2010.  \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s hearing, Department Counsel offered 29 exhibits. (Tr. 27; GE 1-29) \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of any exhibits that were generated more than \nseven years ago because some questions on his SF-86 limited the scope of the \ninformation requested to seven years. (Tr. 26-27) Additionally, Applicant\u2019s Top Secret \nclearance was approved in 2002, and he asserted that any derogatory information from \nbefore 2002 was already deemed insufficient to be the basis to deny his access to Top \nSecret information. (Tr. 26-27) I overruled Applicant\u2019s objections; however, I agreed to \napply his comments to the weight given to GE 1-29. (Tr. 28) I admitted the hearing \nnotice, the SOR, and the response to the SOR. (HE 1-3) On May 10, 2010, I received \nthe transcript. The record was held open until May 13, 2010, to permit Applicant to \nsubmit additional evidence. (Tr. 20, 110) After the hearing, Applicant submitted a \nstatement about completion of an alcohol-related counseling program in 2007. (AE A) \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to my consideration of AE A, and I admitted AE \nA. (HE 4)    \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted parts of several of the SOR \nallegations, and then provided extensive explanations. (HE 3) His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old general foreman in the carpentry field. (Tr. 10, 32; GE \n1)2 Applicant did not graduate from high school and he does not have a graduate \nequivalency diploma. (Tr. 10-11) He has not attended college. (Tr. 11) He had a child \nwhen he was 17 and was unable to continue with high school. (Tr. 24) He married in \n1970 and was divorced in 1996. (Tr. 97) He has three children who are 21, 27, and 39. \n(Tr. 32, 98) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 33) He has worked on \u201cstuff\u201d at the \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nWhite House and other places. (Tr. 97) He said he had a letter of commendation from \nPresident Clinton, and I asked him to provide a copy of the letter after the hearing. (Tr. \n97) However, he said he was unsure whether he could find it. (Tr. 97) He did not \nprovide the letter from President Clinton after his hearing. (Tr. 97) He stated that he can \ncompletely build a 14-story building, a bridge, a clean room, or a bomb-proof building \nfrom the ground up by managing a construction crew. (Tr. 98-99)  \n \nAlcohol consumption \n \nApplicant has consumed alcohol since 1971 (when he was 17), and he continues \nto consume alcohol. (Tr. 33; GE 3 at 10) He drinks from two to about six beers at a \nsitting. (Tr. 33; GE 3 at 10; GE 7 at 8-9) During the wintertime, he might not drink any \nbeer at all; however, he drinks more beer during the summer. (Tr. 33, 36) His alcohol \nconsumption does not follow a pattern. (Tr. 36) He can drink six beers and still does not \nhave a problem functioning; however, he recognized he would be over the legal limit for \ndriving. (Tr. 34) He did not believe that he consumed six beers and then drove a motor \nvehicle in the last two years. (Tr. 34-35) Two years ago, Applicant was diagnosed with \ndiabetes and now he must reduce his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 35)  \n \nIn 1972, the police stopped Applicant for speeding. (Tr. 65-66) Applicant\u2019s boss \nhad left two beers on the backseat. (Tr. 66) Applicant was not yet 21 years old, and was \nunderage to possess alcohol. (Tr. 66) Although he may have consumed some beer \nearlier in the day, he denied that he had more than a remnant of one beer in his system \nwhen he was driving.3 (Tr. 69) Applicant said the police officer was very aggressive and \npushed Applicant, and then the police officer arrested him for driving under the influence \nof alcohol (DUI). (Tr. 70; SOR \u00b6 1.g) The charge was subsequently dismissed. (GE 5) \n   \nIn 1991, the police stopped Applicant for speeding. (Tr. 64) Applicant complied \nwith the police request that he submit to a breathalyzer test. (Tr. 63) Applicant was \ncharged with DUI. (Tr. 62; SOR \u00b6 1.f) After a contested trial, he was found guilty of DUI \nand sentenced to a fine and probation. (Tr. 63-65; GE 7 at 4) He denied that he was \nactually intoxicated. (Tr. 63) \n \nIn January 1994, the police stopped Applicant for driving 80 miles per hour in a \n50-mile-per-hour zone. (Tr. 56) Applicant did not think he was going that fast. (Tr. 56) \nApplicant was drinking alcohol while he was driving. (Tr. 57) He said he drank three \nbeers at the most. (Tr. 58) Applicant claimed he passed the field sobriety tests even \nthough the police reports say that he failed them. (Tr. 58, 60) The police report states \nApplicant had slurred speech, and a strong odor of alcohol. (Tr. 58; GE 17) Applicant \nclaimed the police always indicate on their forms that there is a strong odor of alcohol, \nand bloodshot eyes. (Tr. 59) The police arrested Applicant for driving while impaired by \nalcohol. (Tr. 55; GE 17; SOR \u00b6 1.e) He could not remember if the police offered him a \nbreathalyzer test. (Tr. 61) If the police offered him a breathalyzer test, he would have \nasked for a lawyer to be present because if the suspect passes the test the police \u201cjust \nturn that meter up so they can get another DWI.\u201d (Tr. 61) The police report indicates \n \n3He stated his breathalyzer result was below the legal limit. (GE 5 at 2)  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant refused a breathalyzer test and was very uncooperative at times. (GE 17) The \n1994 charge was subsequently dismissed.   \n \nOn January 27, 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with second degree \nassault on January 26, 1998. (GE 19; SOR \u00b6 2.a) On February 19, 1999, the charge \nwas Nolle Prosequi. (GE 18, 21) His 1982 assault charge was also Nolle Prosequi. (GE \n29) The assault charges were dismissed because Applicant\u2019s spouse admitted that he \ndid not hit her, or because she did not support the prosecution of his case. (GE 7 at 6, \n8) \n  \nPossession of a concealed weapon and failure to appear in 1998 and 1999 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.b) \n  \nIn 1998, the police arrested Applicant for having a concealed handgun4 in his \nvan. (Tr. 70) Although the weapon was legally registered, Applicant did not have a \nconcealed weapons permit. (Tr. 70-71) His handgun was loaded. (Tr. 71) He wrote a \nletter to the judge and informed the judge that he would miss his court date. (Tr. 72) By \nthe time the judge responded to Applicant\u2019s letter, Applicant had already left the country. \n(Tr. 73) He had a court date in January 1999; however, he was out of the country and \nmissed his court date. (Tr. 71) \n \nOn August 23, 2002, Applicant was terminated from employment because of the \npending firearm offense. (GE 7 at 8) \n \nOn December 2, 2002, Applicant said in a statement, \u201cI was supposed to report \nto the police station upon my return to the US but my lawyer advised me not to because \nhe wanted to continue the postponement. If needed for my clearance, I will convince my \nlawyer to take this action back to the court for a hearing.\u201d (Tr. 80; GE 7 at 5) At his \nhearing, Applicant said he did not turn himself in because it was not on his mind. (Tr. \n78-79) Applicant admitted that he did not recall his lawyer saying he did not want \nApplicant to turn himself in to the authorities. (Tr. 81) He did not provide a credible \nexplanation for why he alleged his lawyer told him not to turn himself in to resolve the \narrest warrant. (Tr. 80-81)5 In May 2003, Applicant was arrested for failing to appear for \nhis court date. (Tr. 75) On July 31, 2003, Applicant was convicted contrary to his pleas \nof Handgun on Person, and he was sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), \nunsupervised probation for one year, a $200 fine, and $415 court costs. (GE 23, 27) \nApplicant\u2019s firearm was forfeited. (Tr. 83; GE 23) \n \n4Applicant purchased a firearm because he was worried about a biker gang that had shot up his \nvan. (Tr. 96) \n  \n5On October 28, 2008, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator: \n \nUpon receiving the court date the [Applicant] wrote the judge a letter explaining that he \nhad to move [out of the country for work]. The subject hired a lawyer . . . to handle this \ncase, and they let the subject [leave the country for work] and put off his case until he \nreturned. Once the subject returned from working [overseas] he attended his court date \n(date unrecalled) at the [court].  (emphasis added) (GE 3 at 8) \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant told the judge at his hearing that he was moving and he did not have \nany place to store his firearm. (Tr. 77) Department Counsel confronted him at his \nhearing with his 2008 SF-86 which indicated he did not move in 1998. (Tr. 78) Applicant \nexplained he was staying with several friends \u201coff and on\u201d and he was going through a \ndivorce.6 (Tr. 78) He did not have a permanent fixed address at that time. (Tr. 78)   \n   \nIn 2000, Applicant was in a car accident after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 54; SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) He hit a parked vehicle. (GE 7 at 3) The police detained Applicant overnight \nbecause the police smelled alcohol on his breath. (Tr. 55; GE 7 at 3) Applicant paid \n$600 restitution for damage to a parked vehicle. (Tr. 55; GE 7 at 3)   \n \nDriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) on July 16, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nOn July 16, 2007, Applicant was drinking beer. (Tr. 45) He was unsure how many \nbeers he drank; however, he believed it was three beers. (Tr. 45-48) He left the bar and \nwas on his way home when he felt sick. (Tr. 46) He stopped his car at 11:30 pm. (Tr. \n46) A police officer stopped behind Applicant\u2019s vehicle. (Tr. 47) Applicant said he told \nthe police officer he was suffering from chest pains. (Tr. 48) The police officer did not \nbelieve he required medical assistance. (Tr. 49) He said he failed some field sobriety \ntests because of the chest pains. (Tr. 48, 51) He did not take a breathalyzer test \nbecause he wanted his attorney to be present. (Tr. 49) He explained why he did not \ntrust breathalyzer tests, unless his lawyer is present. The police deliberately turn \nbreathalyzer machines out of calibration to help prove people are DUI, and he wanted \nan attorney to be present to prevent police misconduct. (Tr. 50) Applicant claimed the \npolice officer slammed him into a wall because he did not want him to get a lawyer. (Tr. \n51) Applicant claimed the police officer lied at his trial about two of the field sobriety \ntests. (Tr. 53) Applicant pleaded not guilty.

(Tr. 37) \nApplicant told the police he wanted to consult a lawyer before taking a breathalyzer test. \n(Tr. 42) The police officer tackled Applicant, beat his head on the floor, and threw him in \njail. (Tr. 93) Applicant went to the hospital the next day, and his lawyer urged Applicant \n\u201cto file things.\u201d (Tr. 93) However, Applicant did not pursue any actions against the police \nbecause he was worried about retaliation against his son and his son\u2019s wife. (Tr. 93) \nApplicant pleaded not guilty to DUI but guilty to negligent driving. (GE 28) Applicant\u2019s \nDUI offense was placed on the stet docket. (GE 28) \n \nThe police officer provided a six-page statement about Applicant\u2019s 2008 DUI \narrest, and the arrest of Applicant\u2019s daughter-in-law. (GE 8) The police officer observed \nApplicant cross the center of the roadway several times.

(Tr. 84) Applicant \ndid not believe he had a problem with alcohol. (Tr. 85) He did not think he had operated \na motor vehicle after consuming more than six beers in the last five years. (Tr. 86) He \ncould not remember driving a car with an open container of alcohol in the last two years. \n(Tr. 87) He said he has never been impaired by alcohol at work, and that alcohol \nconsumption has never affected his work. (Tr. 89, 95) \n \nApplicant received an alcohol-related evaluation in 1991. (Tr. 89) He said the \n1991 program concluded he did not have a problem with excessive alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 90) A written copy of the alcohol-related evaluation was not offered as \na hearing exhibit.   \n \nFrom August 13, 2007, to November 7, 2007, Applicant attended a one-hour \nevaluation and 12 group, alcohol counseling sessions.7 (AE A) Applicant \u201cwas \ncooperative and compliant throughout his stay at the [outpatient substance abuse \n \n7Applicant did not disclose this alcohol-related treatment on his 2008 SF-86.

(Tr. 91) The letter from the \noutpatient substance abuse treatment facility did not include a diagnosis or prognosis. \n(AE A)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and J (criminal conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nOne alcohol consumption disqualifying condition could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 22(a) provides, \n\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent.\u201d \n \nNone of the other disqualifying conditions fully apply because Applicant did not \nhave any alcohol-related incidents at work, he did not have a diagnosis of alcohol abuse \nor dependency, there was no evidence of binge-consumption of alcohol, and he did not \nviolate any court orders concerning his alcohol consumption.   \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies. Applicant had alcohol-related arrests or accidents in 1972, \n1991, 1994, 2000, 2007, and 2008.  Of these six alcohol-related events, he was \nconvicted once (of DWI in 1991).    \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the Government has met its initial burden \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n  \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant began consumption of \nalcohol at age 17, and he continued to consume alcohol with periods of abstinence of \nfor the next 38 years. He did not acknowledge that he had a problem with excessive \nalcohol consumption. He completed 13 hours of alcohol-counseling in 2007. He did not \nreceive a positive prognosis from a physician, who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program. He currently consumes alcohol. Despite some positive \ndevelopments, his extensive alcohol-related driving problems continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Alcohol consumption concerns \nare not fully mitigated for the reasons stated in the whole-person concept, infra. \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because Applicant had alcohol-related arrests in \n1972, 1991, 1994, 2007, and 2008. In 1998, Applicant was convicted of possession of a \nconcealed firearm. He was also arrested for two assaults. These arrests are sufficient to \nrequire further inquiry into the applicability of mitigating conditions.    \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies to his 1991 DUI and his 1998 possession of a concealed \nfirearm. These two offenses occurred so long ago that they are unlikely to recur. These \ntwo offenses do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to all of the arrests except his 1991 DUI and his 1998, \npossession of a concealed firearm. He was convicted of both offenses.  \n  \nIn sum, criminal conduct concerns are mitigated because Appellant was only \nconvicted of two offenses, and the most recent offense was in 1998. He denies criminal \nculpability on all offenses not involving a criminal conviction. Notwithstanding the \nabsence of more than two criminal convictions, Applicant had alcohol-related arrests or \naccidents in 1972, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2007, and 2008. Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption \nis the fundamental security concern, and his alcohol problem is better addressed under \nGuideline G than under Guideline J. \n \n  \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough there is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance, \nthe mitigation evidence is insufficient to resolve security concerns at this time. Applicant \ncontributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence of any \ndrug abuse. There is no evidence of disloyalty, or that he would intentionally violate \nnational security. His good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation, \nand mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to \nretain his employment after his security clearance was called into question. Applicant \nknows the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant has consumed alcohol since he was 17 years old. He has \nconsumed alcohol at times to excess, with some periods of abstinence, for 38 years. \nApplicant had alcohol-related arrests or accidents in 1972, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2007, and \n2008. He completed a 13-hour alcohol-related counseling program in 2007, and then he \nresumed his alcohol consumption.8   \n \n8For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show \nmany different permutations. In cases of substantial alcohol consumption, involving a \nsignificant number of alcohol-related incidents, mitigation is not possible unless there is \na fairly lengthy period of abstention from alcohol consumption, or very strong evidence \nof responsible, limited alcohol consumption.9 Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption \nis of long duration, and it contributed to his altercations with the police, as well as his \narrests for DUI. Moreover, I am not satisfied that Applicant was candid and truthful at his \nhearing about his level of alcohol consumption. From his demeanor, and the way he \nanswered questions, I am convinced he was understating the amount of alcohol he \nconsumed and is consuming. He also made inconsistent statements about why he \nmissed his court hearing for his possession of a concealed handgun. He was not truthful \nwhen he said he had permission to miss his court date, and when he said his lawyer \ntold him not to turn himself in to the police. His prior inconsistent statements are strictly \napplied to the issues of assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility, evaluation of whether he \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation, and for whole-person analysis.10 In \nconclusion, lingering doubts remain concerning Applicant\u2019s current credibility, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, rehabilitation, and good judgment.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 12968, the Directive, the Regulation, the AGs, and other \ncited references to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. For \nthe reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \n9See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 24, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 1, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nDecember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nNovember 4, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf but did not submit any documentary evidence. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted a letter, which was \nmarked Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on November 12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since February \n2008. He attended college for a period but did not obtain a degree. He is single with no \nchildren. He and his girlfriend live together.1  \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana in about December 2003. Between \nDecember 2003 and April 2007, he used marijuana about three to four times a week. \nHe purchased small amounts of marijuana for his use. Applicant used psilocybin \nmushrooms on two occasions in 2004 and 2005. He did not enjoy the experience and \nhas not used them since.2  \n \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since April 2007. His girlfriend is \nvehemently opposed to illegal drug use, as her brother died of a drug overdose. \nApplicant plans on proposing to her in several months and would not want to disappoint \nher. The group he used to use drugs with has essentially disbanded. He occasionally \nsees several of his old friends, but the friends he still has contact with have either \nstopped using drugs or keep their drug use to themselves. Applicant recently purchased \na home.3  \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nMay 21, 2008. He fully listed his illegal drug use. He was questioned by an investigator \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on July 16, 2008, and fully discussed \nhis drug use. He stated that he no longer used illegal drugs but could not rule out the \npossibility of use in the future. He was open, honest, and candid about his drug use at \nhis hearing. He admitted that he exhibited extremely poor judgment when he used \nillegal drugs. He stated that he was attempting to be completely honest with the OPM \ninvestigator. His commitment to being completely drug-free has crystallized since the \ninterview. He credibly testified that he will never use illegal drugs again. He submitted a \nstatement of intent not to abuse any illegal drugs in the future with automatic revocation \nof clearance for any violation.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 16, 30-31; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 15-19, 23-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n4 Tr. at 14-20; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;5 and  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) \nas disqualifying conditions.   \n \nTwo Drug Involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant stopped using illegal drugs in April 2007. He disassociated himself from \nhis drug-using friends and avoided the environment where drugs were used. His \ngirlfriend is adamantly opposed to illegal drug use. He has a good job and has recently \n                                                          \n5 Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from \napproved medical direction.  \n\n \n5 \n \npurchased a home. He is going to propose to his girlfriend. He signed a statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. He clearly, unequivocally, \nand credibly committed to remaining drug-free. I find an appropriate period of \nabstinence and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \nyoung man who regularly used illegal drugs, almost exclusively marijuana, for several \nyears. He matured and stopped using illegal drugs in April 2007, before he started work \nfor his current employer in February 2008 and applied for a security clearance in May \n2008. He and his girlfriend live in a house he recently purchased. She is vehemently \nopposed to illegal drug use, having lost her brother to a drug overdose. He enjoys his \njob. He no longer associates with most of the people he used drugs with. The few he \nstill occasionally sees have either stopped using drugs or keep their drug use hidden \nfrom him. Applicant credibly testified to a firm commitment to remaining drug-free.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Drug Involvement security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On August 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005,\nwhich are effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn her August 10, 2009, response, Applicant admitted 27 of 28 allegations set\nforth in the SOR and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on October\n7, 2009. The parties agreed to a hearing date of November 19, 2009. A notice of\nhearing was issued to that effect on October 16, 2009. The notice was reissued on\nNovember 10, 2009, reflecting a change in the hearing time. The hearing was convened\nas scheduled. Department Counsel introduced eight documents accepted into the\nrecord without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-8. Applicant was accompanied by her\nmother, who gave testimony on her daughter\u2019s behalf. Applicant also gave testimony\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n Tr. 41.\n      1\n Tr. 31.\n      2\n Tr. 23. The disability payments received were less than Applicant\u2019s regular salary. \n      3\n Tr. 19-20.\n      4\n Tr. 29. Applicant was paid benefits retroactively back to her November 2007 termination date.\n      5\n Tr. 30. Prior to her unemployment, Applicant was in good standing with most or all of her accounts.\n      6\n2\nand was examined by Department Counsel. Applicant introduced six documents, which\nwere accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A-F. She was given until\nDecember 4, 2009, to supplement the record with any additional documents. The\ntranscript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on November 24, 2009. The record was\nclosed on December 7, 2009.\nOn December 11, 2009, Applicant submitted one additional document, which\nwas forwarded to me on December 15, 2009. Department Counsel posed no objection\nto the document, noting it was \u201chelpful in completing the record.\u201d It was accepted into\nthe record as Ex. G on December 18, 2009, and the record was closed. Based on a\nreview of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant met her burden\nregarding the financial considerations security concerns raised. Security clearance is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old facilities manager/property administrator who has\nworked for the same government contractor for over one year. She has earned a high\nschool diploma. Applicant is a single mother who has never received child support.1\nShe joined a company in 1996 and received a security clearance in 2002.

She found new\n2\nemployment within a few weeks, but the position paid about $14,000 less in annual\nsalary. \nIn the summer of 2007, Applicant took temporary leave from her employment\nand received medical disability payments while she underwent foot surgery. Her doctor\nrepeatedly extended her recuperation period.  As she prepared to return to work in\n3\nNovember 2007, her employment was terminated. She filed for unemployment benefits,\nbut her claim was denied because her company reported that she \u201cleft her position and\ndidn\u2019t notify them of the extensions.\u201d  She appealed the denial, submitting evidence of\n4\nher correspondence with her supervisor regarding her circumstances. She was\nawarded unemployment compensation in February 2008.  Without income for four\n5\nmonths, however, many of her credit cards became past due.  \n6\n\n Tr. 21. \u201cI had family I had to pay back. I had friends I had to pay back. Other things, I had to get caught\n      7\nup. And there was just really no way to get all of that rolling and then get the fees paid to get to a good\nstanding and, then, I went in for counseling for bankruptcy and decided to do the bankruptcy.\u201d\n Tr. 36.\n      8\n Tr. 37.\n      9\n Id.\n      10\n Tr. 37-38.\n      11\n Tr. 41.\n      12\n Tr. 40.\n      13\n Applicant possessed approximately 30 credit cards.

Meanwhile, neither her job counseling nor job\nhunting proved to be effective, further vexing her desire to honor her debts. Although\nunemployment benefits were reinitiated in August 2008, she was hired by her present\nemployer the next month. \nDespite her new-found employment, eight combined months of unemployment\nleft her significantly in debt. Although she tried to address her debts, the effort was\n\u201coverwhelming.\u201d  She ultimately petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on July\n7\n29, 2009. She received credit management counseling and devised a budget.  As a\n8\nresult of this counseling, Applicant ceased her acquisition of new credit cards. She now\nlimits her use of credit and tries to use them only for emergency situations.\u201d  The\n9\nbankruptcy action and this process has been a learning experience.  She now\n10\nunderstands the pitfalls of credit cards, the way interest compounds, and how minimum\npayments make little headway toward paying off one\u2019s purchases.  Today, Applicant\n11\nlives within her means.\nAt work, Applicant has been entrusted with handling funds and has performed\nher functions with those funds successfully and responsibly.  She is considered a\n12\nreliable employee and has maintained her job without difficulty. She has had no\nsubsequent podiatric or other medical issues. Her mother corroborated Applicant\u2019s\nversion of Applicant\u2019s recent professional and financial difficulties. The mother noted\nthat her daughter is responsible, citing specifically to her daughter\u2019s successful single\nparenting and her genuine efforts toward honoring obligations to family and friends.  \n13\nAt issue in the SOR are 28 allegations. Each allegation represents a separate\nfinancial obligation. Most of the allegations concern credit cards.  A cumulative debt of\n14\napproximately $21,000 is at issue.

In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n19\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n20\n21\n\n Id.\n      22\n Id.\n      23\n AG \u00b6 18, which also notes, \u201cAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\n      24\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n22\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.23\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under\n24\nthis guideline. Here, Applicant acquired approximately $21,000 in delinquent debt\nbetween 2005 and 2008, principally comprised of numerous overdue credit card\nbalances. Therefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s acquisition of delinquent debt mainly occurred between 2005 and\n2008, when she was subject to a 2005 reduction in force and underwent necessary\npodiatric surgery in 2007. As a result of her protracted recovery period, she was\n\n6\nterminated from her job. This situation was followed by a delay in receiving\nunemployment benefits, followed by difficulty in finding new employment. Lacking\nstable income during these periods, she became delinquent on her previously current\ncredit card accounts despite her desire to honor her debts. Since recovering from her\nsurgery, her health has been good. She has been able to maintain steady employment\nand demonstrate her reliability with regard to office and personal finances. FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nAs noted, Applicant was terminated from her employment in 2005 due to a\nreduction in force. Necessary surgery and a protracted recovery in 2007 caused her to\nbe let go from her next position. For the next year, she faced difficulty securing\nappropriate unemployment benefits and finding a new position despite her best efforts.\nThroughout this time, she only received intermittent state aid. Her credit cards became\npast-due to the point she was overwhelmed when she tried to manage them after she\nfound new employment. Given these facts, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. It\nbrought Applicant clarity with regard to the potential hazards of unplanned credit card\nuse, the false allure of minimum payments, and the need to first consider the use of\ncredit in terms of one\u2019s overall financial means. As for the debt she acquired between\n2005 and 2008, her debts were successfully discharged through bankruptcy. She is\nrepaying debts to family and friends. She manages office funds reliably and is now\nliving within her means. Consequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control). In contrast, however, the Appeal Board declines\nto acknowledge bankruptcy as a good-faith approach toward resolving one\u2019s debts.\nTherefore, FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.\nIn presenting her case, Applicant demonstrated how easily an adverse change in\nfinancial circumstances can affect credit and credit cards which were previously in good\nstanding. But for her periods of unemployment and reduced income, there is no reason\nto believe any of her accounts would have become delinquent and triggered an adverse\nentry on her credit report. Overwhelmed and incapable of ameliorating her financial\nsituation on her own after adversity struck, she successfully sought bankruptcy\nprotection. \nWhile bankruptcy does not provide evidence that an applicant satisfied her debts\nthrough her own resources, it is a legally recognized method for resolving one\u2019s debts.\nMore importantly, Applicant demonstrated a superior understanding of the risks\nassociated with using credit cards, has committed herself to using them only for\nemergencies, and has learned the importance of living within her means at all times,\nboth good and bad. While it could be argued that additional time is needed to gauge\n\n7\nhow Applicant manages her income, her financial management while employed has\nnever been at issue. The only test of whether history will repeat itself is if she were to\nlose her job, face difficulty qualifying for unemployment, and endure a protracted period\nof unemployment. A repeat of such a confluence of events is unlikely. Therefore,\nadditional time to demonstrate her financial abilities under her current circumstances\nwould prove to be superfluous. There is no evidence that Applicant has poor self-\ncontrol or is unwilling to abide by rules. She has benefited from credit and financial\ncounseling. Her reliability has been proven at home and at work. In light of these\nparticular circumstances, Applicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant\u2019s testimony was highly credible. With regard to the \u201cwhole person,\u201d\nmany factors speak in her favor. She is a mature woman who has raised a child without\nfinancial aid. She persisted in her pursuit of employment despite adverse personal\nconditions during a downturn in the national economy. She recognized that she was\nfinancially \u201coverwhelmed\u201d after her periods of unemployment and responsibly sought to\naddress her situation. Her delinquent debt was caused by circumstances beyond her\ncontrol. She has learned that although she had her credit cards under control and in\ntimely payment before she lost her job, an unexpected professional downturn can\njeopardize otherwise well-balanced books.\nSpeaking against Applicant is her past use of credit cards. Between 2002 and\n2005 she acquired a large number of relatively modest credit cards. She did so as a\nmature woman fully aware of her income, financial resources, and obligations. While\nshe was able to keep current on her balances while employed, she lacked sufficient\nfinancial reserves to meet her minimum payments when her circumstances were\nreversed. While those reversals were beyond her control, prior financial counseling\n\n8\ncould have prepared her for such adverse contingencies. In Applicant\u2019s situation, she\nsought bankruptcy protection and received credit counseling that taught her the risks of\ncredit card reliance. Today, she is employed, derives a regular income, lives within her\nmeans, is debt free, and understands how to avoid setting herself up for potential credit\ncard problems in the future. In her highly credible testimony and in response to\nexamination by the government, she demonstrated her commitment to future restraint.\nIn light of the unique circumstances presented in this case, I find finance-based security\nconcerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.bb \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

He reported receiving an honorable discharge in 1994 from the inactive reserve after nine months of enlisted military service. This is his first application for a security clearance. He and his wife have two children living with them. He also has three children living with his former wife and one living with a former girlfriend. Applicant earned a degree in computer network engineering from a college of technology in 2002. He also earned additional class certificates from another technology school that he attended in 2005 and 2006. In his responses to the SOR, he formally admitted the 5 allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n, and denied that the falsifications on his security clearance application, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, were intentional.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes 14 delinquent debts totaling more than $60,000, including\nsubstantial child support and student loan balances. He demonstrated no voluntary\naction to resolve any of these debts despite continuous employment for the past three\nyears. He falsely denied the existence of these debts on his security clearance\napplication, and provided insufficient evidence to mitigate the resulting security\nconcerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on September 16,\n2008.  On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The action was\n2\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\nMay 27, 2010\n\nItems 6 and 7.\n3\nThe Government submitted 14 Items in support of the SOR allegations.\n4\nItem 5; Item 7 at 10.\n5\n2\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective within the Department of\nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 28, 2009, and again on\nSeptember 28, 2009, and requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge\non the written record without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the\n3\nGovernment\u2019s written case on October 27, 2009. A complete copy of the File of\nRelevant Material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an\n4\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation\nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non November 4, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He provided no further response to the\nFORM within the 30-day period, did not request additional time to respond, and made\nno objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. I\nreceived the case assignment on February 17, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he was hired\nin August 2008. He reported receiving an honorable discharge in 1994 from the inactive\nreserve after nine months of enlisted military service. This is his first application for a\nsecurity clearance. He and his wife have two children living with them. He also has\nthree children living with his former wife and one living with a former girlfriend. Applicant\nearned a degree in computer network engineering from a college of technology in 2002.\nHe also earned additional class certificates from another technology school that he\nattended in 2005 and 2006.  In his responses to the SOR, he formally admitted the\n5\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n, and denied that the falsifications on his security\nclearance application, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, were intentional. Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, including his responses to the SOR, to the FORM, and to DOHA\ninterrogatories, are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant admitted owing each of the 14 delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1,\ntotaling $60,484. He claimed to be paying off the $1,480 debt from a judgment entered\nagainst him in February 2004, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, through garnishment of his pay.\nHowever, he provided no documents to substantiate such payments, and the\n\nItem 7 at 1; Item 10 at 2; Items 11 through 14.\n6\nItem 7 at 8-9; Item 10 at 3; Items 11 through 14.\n7\nItem 8 at 11-17; Item 9 at 3.\n8\nItems 11 through 14.\n9\nItem 8 at 38.\n10\nItem 6 at 16; Item 7 at 15-17; Item 10 at 6.\n11\nItem 9 at 3-6.\n12\n3\noutstanding balance remains unchanged on all record credit reports.  He similarly\n6\nclaimed to be making payments toward his two delinquent child support accounts,\ntotaling $25,531, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i, through payroll deductions and tax\nrefunds. He provided no substantiation of these claims, and the total due actually\nincreased from his October 2008 credit report to the June 2009 credit report in the\nrecord.  He admitted making no payments toward any of the remaining debts, and\n7\nprovided no documentation of any progress in his claimed \u201cplan\u201d to make repayment\narrangements with the creditors involved. \nApplicant provided no evidence of financial counseling, and no budget\ninformation from which to determine his present or future solvency. Applicant was hired\nby a cellular telephone company in 2002 upon completion of his computer engineering\ndegree program. He worked there for two years, then was laid off. He did not explain\nthe reason for losing his job. He remained unemployed for two and a half years, but has\nbeen continuously employed since February 2007.  Some of his debts first became\n8\ndelinquent during each year between 2002 and 2008, except 2003.   \n9\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to questions 28a and 28b on his security\nclearance application. The former asked whether he had been over 180 days delinquent\non any debts in the past 7 years, and the latter asked if he was currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debts.  He subsequently admitted these answers were false, but\n10\ndenied that he intended to falsify the answers or to deceive anyone. He claimed to have\nbeen unaware of the existence of these debts.  During his interview with an investigator\n11\nfrom the Office of Personnel Management, conducted about six weeks after he signed\nand certified the truth of his answers on the SF 86, he displayed his knowledge of most\nof his delinquent debts, including all of the large ones, by describing how they arose.  \n12\nApplicant submitted no evidence describing character, trustworthiness, or work\nperformance. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person\nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.\n  \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\nFORM at 4.\n13\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns\nunder two Guideline F DCs, as set forth in AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n13\nApplicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy 14 delinquent debts, totaling\nmore than $60,000, which arose between 2002 and 2008. DC 19(a) and (c) were clearly\nestablished, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate the\nresulting security concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and \n\nISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2009).\n14\nISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App.\n15\nBd. Jul. 6, 2006)). \n6\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility involves 14 different accounts, spans the past\nseven years, and continues to date. He did not demonstrate that these obligations will\nbe fulfilled anytime soon, or that he can avoid additional delinquencies in the future. The\nevidence does not support application of MC 20(a). \nApplicant was unemployed for about a third of the time since he left school in\n2002, but he provided no evidence tending to show that the causes of this\nunemployment were largely beyond his control. Similarly, he made no showing that the\nmedical, educational, and child support debts arose from conditions that were beyond\nhis control. Finally, he provided nothing to substantiate that he acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances, so no mitigation under MC 20(b) was established.\nApplicant documented neither financial counseling nor any good-faith effort to\nresolve any of his outstanding debts. His claimed involuntary garnishments for the child\nsupport and judgment debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, and 1.i, even if true, do not\nqualify as good-faith efforts at resolution.  Accordingly, Applicant failed to establish\n14\nmitigation under MC 20(c) or MC 20(d). \u201cAn applicant is not required to show that [he]\nhas completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a reasonable\nplan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d15\nApplicant demonstrated neither a reasonable plan nor significant actions to implement\none.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The potentially disqualifying condition alleged in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n7\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d to two questions on his security clearance\napplication. His explanation for denying the existence of his numerous and substantial\ndelinquent debts was unconvincing. He admitted knowledge of the circumstances giving\nrise to most the debts shortly after certifying the truth of his false answers denying their\nexistence. Appellant is highly educated, and did not claim to misunderstand the\nquestions. His possible, and plausible, ignorance of the existence or particulars of a few\nof his smaller delinquencies does not justify his affirmative denial of any delinquent\ndebt. He knew that he had a large amount of significantly delinquent debt, including\nmore than $25,000 in child support arrears and almost $30,000 in student loans, yet\ndenied that fact twice on his SF 86. Serious security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a) were\nraised by these facts.\nOther than self-serving statements that his falsifications were not intended to\ndeceive the government, Applicant offered no evidence that would tend to support any\nmitigating condition under Guideline E. After careful review of the record, I find that\nnone of them apply. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature,\neducated, and experienced individual, who is responsible for his voluntary choices and\nconduct that underlie the security concerns expressed in the SOR. His financial\nirresponsibility spans the past seven years, including two and a half years of\nunemployment, and continue at present. He demonstrated little, if any, voluntary effort\n\n8\nto resolve his debts since regaining employment more than three years ago. He\nremains subject to coercion and duress from his financial obligations, and made no\nshowing that such problems are unlikely to continue or recur. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate attempt to conceal relevant information about his\ndelinquent debts on his SF 86 also raises serious and unmitigated security concerns.\nThe record contains insufficient other evidence about his character, trustworthiness, or\nresponsibility to mitigate these concerns. Recurrence of this disregard for the\nfundamental integrity of security procedures and requirements was not shown to be\nunlikely.\nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hayes, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on June 13, 2008. \nOn January 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) which became effective within the Department of Defense \non September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 10, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 21, 2010. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 28, 2010. On August 9, 2010, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued scheduling the hearing for August 31, 2010. The case was heard on that \ndate. The Government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 7. The Applicant testified and offered four exhibits which were \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The record was held open until September \n15, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. On September 10, 2010, \nApplicant requested additional time to submit documents. His request was granted until \nOctober 14, 2010\n\n \n \n \n2\nOctober 1, 2010. He submitted eight exhibits which were admitted as AE E \u2013 L. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response to the post-hearing submissions is marked as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 8, 2010.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He denied the allegation in \u00b6 1.g.  Department counsel withdrew the \nallegation in \u00b6 1.g because it was a duplicate of SOR \u00b61.b.  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old logistical analyst employed with a Department of \nDefense (DOD) contractor seeking to maintain a security clearance. He has been \nemployed with his current company since December 2009. He served 22 years on \nactive duty in the United States Marine Corps. He retired at the rank of gunnery \nsergeant in March 1998. He has held a security clearance continuously since 2007. He \nalso held a security clearance while on active duty. He is a high school graduate. He \ndivorced his first wife after 19 years of marriage in 1998. He married his current wife in \nFebruary 2008. Three sons were born during his first marriage. His current wife\u2019s two \nchildren, ages 14 and 18, live with Applicant and his wife. (Tr. 5-7, 27-28, 32-33, 81; \nGov 1)  \n \nWhen Applicant divorced his first wife, he gave her the house and assumed \nresponsibility for all of the debts of the marriage. He incurred credit card debt after the \ndivorce. (Tr. 28-31) \n \nApplicant worked several jobs after retiring from the military. In January 2006, he \nquit his job to start his own medical billing company. He and his wife and two employees \nhandled the medical billing for several doctor\u2019s offices. He leased office space and \nborrowed $20,000 to start the business. Unbeknownst to him, Applicant\u2019s two \nemployees made inappropriate charges on company accounts. They eventually quit, in \npart, because he was unable to pay their salaries. He and his wife moved the business \nto their home around 2008. In January 2008, Applicant obtained full-time employment \nwith a defense contractor. He worked for several contractors before being hired in his \ncurrent position. He paid off the office lease and the water bill. His medical billing \ncompany has only one client. His wife is the sole employee. He estimates that he \naccumulated $50,000 in debt from business losses. (Tr. 7, 33-36, 66; Gov 1, section 11; \nGov 3 at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that Applicant \nhas six delinquent accounts which total approximately $82,584. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f; Gov \n2-7) During the hearing, he testified that he was making payments towards his \naccounts. He did not bring documentation to the hearing verifying that he was paying \nhis debts. He was given additional time to provide documentation. (Tr. 40-44) Applicant \nwas advised about the importance of providing documentation to corroborate that his \ndebts were being paid at the end of the hearing. (Tr. 88-93) \n\n \n \n \n3\n The status of the delinquent debts are:  \n \n1.a: $1,530 judgment filed against Applicant in February 2008 on behalf of a \ncredit card company. In response to interrogatories dated September 4, 2009, Applicant \nindicated he was making $200 payments to the creditor. He alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.c were the same account but did not provide documentation verifying this \nassertion.  Status of this debt is uncertain. After the hearing, he provided a written \nstatement that he mails checks to a collection agency but provided no documentation \nverifying payments or a payment history. It is also unclear whether the $100 payment \ngoes to the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a or SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 51, 83-84; Gov 2 at 2; Gov \n7 at 3; AE I) \n \n1.b: $12,365 judgment filed against Applicant in December 2008 on behalf of a \nbank.  Applicant testified that he is making monthly payments of $200. After the hearing, \nhe provided the top part of a receipt that he received from the debt collection group to \nwhom he claims that he sends monthly payments. He wrote check numbers on the top \npart of the receipt for checks that he apparently sent to the debt collection group. The \ndocuments provided do not verify the amount of the payment, the date the payment was \nmade, and the current balance. He did not provide copies of his bank records showing \nthe processed checks. (Tr. 49;  Gov 3 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 5 at 3; gov 7 at 4, 11; AE H)  \n \n1.c: $18,161 charge off account with a credit card that is held by the same \ncreditor alleged in SOR \u00b61.a. In his response to interrogatories, dated September 4, \n2009, Applicant claimed that he was making $200 monthly payments towards this \naccount. In his post-hearing submissions, Applicant claims that he mails $100 checks to \na collection agency each month. He provided no documentation corroborating this \nassertion. It is also unclear whether the $100 payment goes to the account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a or SOR \u00b6 1.c.  (Tr. 41, 50, 65; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 1; \nGov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 5, 11; AE I) \n \n1.d: $5,911 judgment owed to a credit union. Applicant has been paying this \njudgment. The balance is down to $392.64. (Tr. 41, 58; Gov 3 at 3-4; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 \nat 3;  Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 5; AE J at 2) \n \n1.e: $29,611 charged off account owed to a military credit union. Applicant \ntestified that he pays between $100 to $200 a month towards this account. After the \nhearing, he provided a statement from the law office collecting on the account that he \nbeen paying $100 a month towards this debt per the arrangement made with their \noffice. It is not clear how long he has been making payments towards this account.  (Tr. \n41; Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 9; AE E) \n \n1.f: $15,006 charged off account owed to a military credit union. Applicant claims \nthat he has been paying $100 to $200 a month towards this debt. After the hearing, he \nprovided a statement from the law office collecting on the account that he been paying \n$200 a month towards this debt and is current on his scheduled monthly payments. It is \nnot clear how long he has been making payments towards this account.  (Tr. 41; Gov 2 \nat 3; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 11; AE F) \n\n \n \n \n4\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary for his full-time job is $80,000. He receives $8,340 \nannually from his military retirement check. The annual income generated from his \nmedical billing business is approximately $20,400. His wife receives approximately \n$12,000 annually in disability payments. He receives $3,900 annually in disability \npayments. Their joint annual income is $124,640. His and his wife\u2019s total monthly \nincome is $7,650. Their monthly expenses and debt payments total $4,786. After \nexpenses and debt payments, he and his wife have approximately $2,864 left over each \nmonth. (AE A) Applicant has paid off other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. (AE \nK at 2)  \n \nApplicant provided several references from co-workers, superiors, and two \nministers. His deputy program manager states he has known Applicant for several \nyears. He trusts him completely and believes he is a person with high integrity. He \nrecommends he be granted his security clearance. (AE B) Applicant\u2019s landlord provided \na letter stating Applicant has been an outstanding tenant for more than three years. (AE \nC and AE G) A business counselor with the Small Business Administration wrote that \nshe has been working with Applicant since he started his medical business in April \n2006. She notes his honesty, integrity, and persistence were evident in their many \ncounseling sessions. (AE L.)  \n \n \nDuring his active service in the Marine Corps, Applicant served in Desert Storm, \nOkinawa, Korea, and Thailand. His military awards and decorations include a Letter of \nAppreciation (6), Meritorious Mast (5 Awards), Achievement (6 Awards), Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon w/2 stars; Good Conduct Medal w/1 Bronze Star and 1 Silver Star, \nKuwaiti Liberation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal w/1 Star; and Navy Commendation \nMedal w/1 Star. (Tr. 39; AE D)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n \n \n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG &19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has \nsix delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $82,584.  Some of the debt \nresulted from his divorce from his first wife. Most of the debts were the result of his \nmedical billing business which was not as successful as Applicant anticipated.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \n\n \n \n \n6\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply. While Applicant presented evidence that he is making \npayments towards the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. 1.e. and 1.f, he did not provide \nsufficient proof that he is making payments towards the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.c. It cannot be determined from the record evidence whether Applicant has \nestablished a significant track record of timely debt repayments to mitigate doubts about \nhis reliability and trustworthiness regarding his finances based on his significant debts.  \n \n \nAG & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant incurred some \ndebt when he divorced his first wife. However, his divorce occurred over 12 years ago. \nMost of the debt resulted when Applicant\u2019s medical billing business was not as \nsuccessful as he anticipated. While there were some factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nwhich created his financial problems, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, it must also be determined \nthat the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. It appears Applicant has \nthe money to resolve his delinquent accounts. However, the record is unclear as to \nwhether Applicant has a track record of making payments towards all of his delinquent \naccounts. I cannot conclude that Applicant has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies.   \n \nAG & 20(c) (the person has received counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) potentially \napplies. Applicant received some counseling with an employee from the Small Business \nAdministration regarding his medical billing business. However there is no evidence that \nhe formally sought out counseling regarding his personal finances. While he is making \nsome payments towards some of his delinquent accounts, it is unlikely that his financial \nsituation will be resolved in the near future, considering the large amount of the \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \n \nAG & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, \nand 1.f. However, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to verify that he is \nmaking timely payments towards the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \nwhich account for approximately $32,056 of the delinquent debt. Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 22 years of \nhonorable active duty service in the United States Marine Corps as well as his favorable \nreferences. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were partially caused by his first divorce. \nHowever, most of his financial problems were caused by Applicant\u2019s attempt to start a \nbusiness which did not prove to be as successful as anticipated. Applicant has been \nemployed continuously since January 2008. He has earned a good income since \nDecember 2009. During the hearing, Applicant testified that he was paying on all of the \ndebts but provided no documentation verifying his assertions. He was advised that he \nneeded to provide documentation corroborating that his debts were being paid after the \nhearing. The record was initially held open two weeks to allow Applicant the opportunity \nto submit documentation. An extension was granted for an additional two weeks. While \nApplicant provided some documentation, it is insufficient to verify Applicant has been \nmaking payments towards all of his delinquent accounts. Questions remain about \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation. I find Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant owed approximately $63,000 for nine unpaid obligations. Applicant \nfailed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under financial \nconsiderations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 18, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 24, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn April 8, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated May 11, 2009. The FORM contained ten \nattachments. On May 18, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along with \nnotice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nResponses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on June 17, 2009. As of August 4, 2009, a response was not \nreceived. On August 7, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.i \nstating the claim against the insurance company had been filed for payment of a \nmedical debt, but payment had yet to be received. He admitted the remaining factual \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations \nare incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and \nexhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old individual working in a security position for a defense \ncontractor since December 2007. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Item 5) \n \n \nFrom October 2003 to January 2006, Applicant owned a dry cleaning business. \nApplicant incurred a $45,148 loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) to start and run this business. (Item 6) \nThe business failed. Applicant asserts the bank was to liquidate the remaining materials \nand equipment from the business and he would pay half of the debt that remained. \n(Item 6) No documentation of the repayment agreement was provided. The cleaning \nbusiness incurred a $1,086 utility bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g), which remains unpaid. (Item 7) The \ncertified public accountant (CPA) used by the business has not been paid $587 for \nservices provided (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant owes the landlord2 $680 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) related \nto the business.  \n \n \nApplicant, in his response to the SOR (Item 4), states that 90 % of his debt is \nrelated to his failed business. He asserts he had excellent credit before acquiring the \nbusiness. In January 2009, in response to interrogatories (Item 7), Applicant stated he \nhad talked with a financial coach and decided to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  \n \n \nOn March 20, 2009, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (Item 10) \nApplicant listed total assets of approximately $79,000 and total liabilities of \n \n \n2 This debt was listed in his March 2009 bankruptcy as owed to a hardware store. (Item 10) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \napproximately $110,000. Applicant listed approximately $70,600 in obligations, \nexcluding his home mortgage. Those obligations include: a $4,000 priority debt to the \nIRS (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $680 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c); three credit card accounts totaling $9,826 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d and \u00b6 1.e); a $52,681 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f); the $1,086 utility bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g); \nthe $587 CPA debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and a $264 medical bill (SOR \u00b6 1.i). (Item 10) The only \nSOR debt not listed was the state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.b). At the time of filing, Applicant\u2019s \nand his wife\u2019s net monthly take home pay was approximately $3,300. (Item 10)  \n  \n \nFrom the bankruptcy filing it does not appear Applicant was living beyond his \nmeans. In the filing, he listed as assets a 1997 Mercury Cougar as his vehicle and a \n$70,000 home, on which approximately $39,000 was owed. (Item 10) \n \n \nIn September 2006, the state entered a $732 tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for unpaid \nemployee taxes related to Applicant\u2019s business. In a July 2008, personal subject \ninterview, Applicant stated he was aware of the lien and was \u201ccurrently working to pay \noff the debt.\u201d (Item 6) In January 2009, in response to written interrogatories, Applicant \nstated the debt had ballooned to approximately $4,500, not further explained. He stated \nhe would make an $80 payment on January 25, 2009. (Item 7) No proof of payment was \nreceived. As of January 2009, the bank was still trying to sell the remaining equipment \nand supplies. (Item 7)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s January 2009 credit bureau report (CBR) lists a $5,751 lien (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and a $732 lien (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Item 8) The $732 lien is also listed in Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 2008 CBR. These are tax liens. \n \n \nApplicant had two3 credit cards with the same creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.d, $3,036 and \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $2,213) Applicant was 120 days past due on his personal credit card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.d, $3,036). (Item 7) The credit card was used for daily purchases and \ntravel expenses. Applicant disagreed with the amount owed. As of June 2008, Applicant \nwas \u201ctrying to make payments to have the debt [brought] up to date.\u201d (Item 6) In January \n2009, Applicant stated he had made a few payments on the debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d, $3,610), \nbut was unable to continue. The second credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $2,213) was a business \ncredit card with the same creditor. (Item 7)  \n \n \nFollowing the business failure, Applicant was unemployed from January 2006 to \nFebruary 2007. (Item 4) As of June 2008, Applicant asserted he was living within his \nmeans and meeting his financial obligations, other than the debts listed in the SOR. \n(Item 6) In January 2009, in response to written interrogatories, Applicant stated he was \noverwhelmed with stress and worry. He did not realize the importance of these matters \nand would provide the information requested. He stated he had learned much \nconcerning debts and was a wiser person. This was not further explained. (Item 7)  \n \n \n \n3 The bankruptcy filing lists Applicant and his wife as owing three credit card accounts to this creditor. \n(Item 10) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nA summary of the nine debts alleged in the SOR follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na \nInternal Revenue Service \ntax lien. \n$5,751 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy.  \nb \nState tax lien amount.  \n$4,500 \n \nUnpaid. Not Included in Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 2009 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nc  \nThis is either a defaulted \nlease account or a \nhardware store debt. \n$680 \n \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nd \nCredit card account. \n$3,036 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \ne \nCredit card account. \n$2,213 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nf \nDefault on a business \nloan. \n$45,186 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \ng \nUnpaid utility bill. \n$1,086 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nh \nUnpaid CPA bill.  \n$587 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \n9i \nUnpaid medical account. \n$264 \nIncluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n$63,303 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant owed a dry cleaning business which failed in January 2006. The \nbusiness generated a state and federal tax lien, unpaid credit card debt, an unpaid CPA \nbill, an unpaid utility bill, and unpaid rent. The record evidence supports a conclusion \nthat Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant had to resort to bankruptcy \nprotection as to his business obligations. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nFollowing the failure of the business, there is little evidence Applicant acted \nresponsibly in trying to address his financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s dry cleaning \nbusiness ended in January 2006. Applicant asserted he made some payments on this \ndebt, but provided no documentation supporting his assertion. In March 2009, he filed \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor bankruptcy protection. There is evidence the bankruptcy was filed, but no evidence \nthe debts having been discharged.  \n \nThe debts are recent and not infrequent. Some, but not all, of the SOR debts \nwere included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Because Applicant chose to have this \nmatter handled administratively, I am unable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or \nform a positive determination as to his truthfulness. Additionally, I am prevented from \nobtaining additional information in order to have a more complete picture concerning the \nfacts and circumstances resulting in Applicant\u2019s financial problems and his bankruptcy \nfiling. \n \nFrom the record, I am unable to find Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred \nunder such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant=s financial problems were contributed to by a failed business and a \nperiod of unemployment for more than one year following the failed business. Normally \na business downturn and loss of employment are factors beyond a person\u2019s control. \nThe record gives no indication why the unemployment occurred and I will not speculate \nas to its cause. However, it has been more than three and a half years since the \nbusiness failed and Applicant has failed to document payment on any debt. Even the \nmedical debt of $264 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) was not paid. Because Applicant has not acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n  \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling, nor is there \nclear indication the problem is being resolved. There is evidence of a bankruptcy filing, \nbut no evidence the debts have been discharged. Applicant asserts he is living within \nhis means and meeting his financial obligations. He also stated he had learned much \nconcerning debts and is a wiser person. Having been unable to evaluate Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to his truthfulness, I am \nunable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and honest in his statements. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20(d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d \nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling his debts is needed, but is not present here. The majority of the SOR debts \nmay be discharged in bankruptcy. The $4,500 state tax lien was not included in that \nbankruptcy and remains unpaid. The record fails to establish a good-faith effort to repay \nthe debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The majority of the debts relate to a \nfailed business. A bankruptcy has been filed, but there is no indication that the debts \nhave been discharged. His bankruptcy filing indicates he has a modest home and an \nolder car. He does not appear to be living beyond his means. I am limited in my findings \nas to credibility and honesty because Applicant chose to have this matter handled \nadministratively.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his failure to meet his \nfinancial obligations. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended. Should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, established they were discharged in bankruptcy, or otherwise \nadequately addressed the obligations, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of \nhis security worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III \nposition is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 30, 2007, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF \n85P). On April 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny Applicant eligibility for a public trust position, citing trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action \nwas taken under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) position, and it \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \nan ADP position. \n \nOn May 18, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 12, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 26, 2009. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled on September 15, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 11. GEs 1 through 9 were admitted without objection. GEs 10 and 11 \nwere considered for administrative notice purposes only. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 21, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the two allegations under \u00b6 1 of the SOR. He denied the \nallegation under \u00b6 2 of the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. He has worked in an ADP position for a defense \ncontractor since November 2007 with some periods of unemployment between jobs. He \nattended college in the late 1980s for approximately two years, but did not complete a \ndegree. He married his first wife in 1977, and they were divorced in 1993. Because of \nhis divorce, Applicant was overwhelmed by his financial problems and filed for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy protection in 1992. He married his current wife in 1997. He has two adult \nchildren of this marriage.  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Air Force from 1976 to 1985. He achieved the rank \nof staff sergeant (E-5), and was honorably discharged in 1985. Because of his military \noccupational specialty, he had access to classified information at the top secret level \nduring most of his 10 years of service. Applicant left the service because of the great job \noffers he received from government contractors. He worked for government contractors \nfrom 1985 to 1995. He held access to classified information, at the secret level or \nhigher, from 1985 to approximately 1993. From 1993 to 1995, he was granted eligibility \nfor a public trust position. From 1995 to November 2007, Applicant did not require \naccess to any classified information. \n \nApplicant has worked the same ADP job, albeit under different government \ncontractors, since 2000. He started working for his current employer in March 2009. His \ncurrent employer is sponsoring Applicant for a public trust position. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn 1990, Applicant failed to file his federal income tax return and did not pay his \ntaxes. In 1992, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against him. Applicant \npaid his 1990 taxes in 1994, and the lien was released.1  \n \nApplicant also failed to file his federal income tax returns and did not pay his \ntaxes for tax years 1992 through 1997. Applicant testified he had no good reason or \nexplanation for his failure to file his tax returns or to pay his taxes (Tr. 83). In 1997, \nApplicant hired an accounting firm to assist him with filing his back tax returns and \ndealing with the IRS. From 1997 to January 2003, he made payroll deduction payments \non his debt to the IRS. He stopped making payments in 2003 after he lost his job. He \nwas unemployed from January to July 2003. He also testified he was unemployed from \nOctober 2005 to October 2006.2  \n \nApplicant made no more payments to the IRS after January 2003. In December \n2006, the IRS filed a $23,504 tax lien against Applicant. In 2007, Applicant attempted to \nsettle his debt with the IRS, but was not able to reach an agreement because the IRS \nwanted a large lump sum down payment that he could not afford. As of his hearing day, \nApplicant had made no payments towards his $23,504 debt to the IRS. At his hearing, \nApplicant claimed he is no longer legally responsible for his debt to the IRS because the \ndebt is barred by the statute of limitations. \n \nIn his October 2007 public trust position application, Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d to \nquestion 22 (a) (asking whether in the last seven years he had been subject to a tax \nlien), and question 22 (b) (asking whether he was currently over 180 days delinquent on \nany financial obligation). He answered \u201cNo\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose that he \ncurrently had a $23,504 debt to the IRS, and that the IRS had filed a lien against him in \nDecember 2006.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant claimed that when he submitted his public trust position \napplication he had no knowledge of the IRS tax lien filed against him in December 2006 \n(Tr. 92). He also claimed that when he submitted his public trust position application \nthere was no valid federal tax lien pending against him (Tr. 24). He admitted, however, \nhe knew he was indebted to the IRS. In his May 2009 answer to the SOR, Applicant \nalso admitted knowing about his $23,504 debt to the IRS. He claimed; however, that he \nwas the one that provided the IRS tax lien information to the government in an \nattachment he included with his public trust position application.  \n \n \n1  SOR \u00b6 1.b mistakenly alleged that a state filed a $4,493 tax lien against Applicant in April 1992, \nwhich was still outstanding. Applicant established the tax lien was filed by the federal government \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to file his 1990 income tax return and to pay his 1990 income taxes. \nApplicant established that the debt was satisfied in 1994 and the lien was released. The government \nwithdrew the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Tr. 46). \n \n2  This statement is inconsistent with information Applicant submitted with his public trust position \napplication. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant claimed that AE 1 (Applicant\u2019s letter to DOHA, dated October 15, \n2008), is similar to a copy of the letter he submitted as an attachment with his public \ntrust position application. I note that Applicant\u2019s public trust position application contains \na one page \u201cAddendum to SF85P,\u201d in which Applicant disclosed he was self-employed \nduring the period of October 2005 to October 2006.3 There are no other addenda \nattached to his public trust position application. Applicant provided no copies of the \nactual addendum he claimed he submitted with his application. \n \nThe IRS \u201cNotice of the Tax Lien\u201d (GE 9), indicates that 1997 was the year of \nassessment for the tax period ending in December 1993. The year of assessment for \ntax years 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 was 1998. The $23,504 federal tax lien \nfiled against Applicant in December 2006 has not been officially released by the IRS \n(GE 7). \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, his answer to the SOR, and at his \nhearing, Applicant claimed that his $23,504 debt to the IRS is not collectable because of \nInternal Revenue Code Sections 6501 (limitations on assessment and collections), 6502 \n(collection after assessment), and 6511. He further claimed that when he invoked such \nprovisions to IRS personnel, he was informed by IRS personnel that there would be no \nfurther claims or attempts to collect his tax debt. Applicant provided no documentary \nevidence of such conversations with IRS personnel. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse and regret for his failure to file his tax returns, to \npay his taxes, and to disclose his tax liens in his public trust position application. He \nclaimed he has learned from his mistakes, and that he has matured. Applicant testified \nseveral times that his failure to disclose his tax liens in his public trust position \napplication was an inadvertent error that he tried to correct during his follow-up interview \nwith government investigators. He wants to continue working for the government, and \nbelieves that because of his years of experience working for the government and \ngovernment contractors, he has a lot to offer. Applicant averred he is well aware of the \nimportance of a public trust position and claimed he has never violated the trust placed \non him during his 30 years working for the military, government contractors, and the \ngovernment. He considers himself to be trustworthy and reliable. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant introduced two character reference letters. One of his \nreferences has known Applicant during 14 years and the other has known Applicant for \nover 23 years. Both references consider Applicant to have outstanding personal and \nprofessional integrity and a strong work ethic. He is also a good father and a family-\noriented man. Both references trust Applicant and endorsed his eligibility for a public \ntrust position.  \n \n \n3  This statement is contrary to Applicant\u2019s testimony indicating he was unemployed during the \nsame period (Tr. 84-85). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s controlling adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \n[or access to sensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the trustworthiness concern is that failure or inability to live \nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1990 and \n1992 through 1997. The IRS filed a tax lien against him in 1992, which was released in \n1994 after he paid his 1990 taxes. The IRS filed a tax lien against him in 2006, for tax \nyears 1992 through 1997, which has not been paid. Applicant had no good excuse or \nreason for his failure to timely file his income tax returns or to pay his taxes. AG \u00b6 19(a): \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(g): \u201cfailure to file annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns as required,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established some circumstances beyond his control contributing to his \ninability to pay his taxes, i.e., his periods of unemployment from January to July 2003 \nand from October 2005 to October 2006. Notwithstanding, none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file annual federal income tax returns as \nrequired by law or his failure to pay his taxes. Applicant claimed he made some \npayments to the IRS from 1997 to 2003, but he failed to provide documentary evidence \nto support his claims. He also failed to continue making payments after he regained \nemployment. After 2003, Applicant made no further effort to pay his back due taxes until \n2007.  \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s debt to the IRS is not collectable because of the passing of \nthe statute of limitations that does not automatically mitigate the financial considerations \nconcerns.4 His behavior is recent and cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security/trustworthiness concern \nstating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n4  In a series of decisions, the Appeal Board has clearly stated that the applicability of the statute \nof limitations does not automatically mitigate financial considerations concerns under AG \u00b6 20(d). See \nISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008). \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his 2007 public trust position \napplication when he failed to disclose that in 2006, the IRS filed a $23,504 federal tax \nlien against him for his failure to pay taxes for tax years 1992 through 1997. He also \nfailed to disclose his debt to the IRS on his application. I do not find his statement at the \nhearing about his lack of knowledge of the IRS lien to be credible. Applicant\u2019s 2007 \npublic trust position application indicated he has been living at his current residence \nsince September 2006 (GE 1). The federal tax lien was filed in December 2006, and it \ncorrectly reflects Applicant\u2019s current residence address (GE 7 and 9). More likely than \nnot, Applicant was mailed and received the notice of the federal tax lien. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions create trustworthiness concerns under two disqualifying \nconditions. Her behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d and 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none apply. Applicant \nfalsified his SF 85P. I do not find his explanations for his failure to disclose the IRS debt \nand lien to be credible. At his hearing, Applicant claimed that, at the time he submitted \nhis application in October 2007, he did not know the IRS filed a tax lien against him in \nDecember 2006. However, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed he disclosed \nthe tax debt and the lien to the government via an attachment to his application.  \n \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s claims of lack of knowledge ate not credible because in \n2004, he was in communication with the IRS and paid off a 2002 IRS lien against him. \nIn 1997, he retained the services of an accounting firm to help him file his back due \nincome tax forms and to deal with the IRS. With their assistance, he made payments to \nthe IRS towards resolution of the IRS debt generated from 1997 to 2003. He stopped \nmaking payments to the IRS because he was laid off for sever months. After resuming \nhis employment in July 2003, he never made any more payments to the IRS. I find it is \nlikely that Applicant and/or his accounting firm were notified by the IRS of the impending \nlien if the debt was not resolved, and later of the filing of the tax lien. \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsification is a serious offense (felony), it is recent, and casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Moreover, I find Applicant minimized his \nbehavior and lied at his hearing. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nor public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, trained man, \nand a good father. He has been successful working for the Air Force, government \ncontractors, and the government for close to 30 years during most of which he had \naccess to classified information. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that \nhe is not a competent worker. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis. He had no good reason to explain his failure to \ntimely file and to pay his federal taxes. Outside of his testimony, he presented little \ndocumentary evidence of efforts to resolve his IRS debt. \n \nMoreover, he deliberately falsified her public trust position application when he \nfailed to disclose his IRS tax lien. Considering her 2004 tax lien release, his contacts \nwith the IRS through his accounting firm, and the period over which the debts have \nbeen delinquent, Applicant knew or should have known of his debt to the IRS and was \nnotified of the 2006 tax lien.  \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s financial behavior and personal \nconduct raise doubt about his ability to have access to sensitive information and his \ntrustworthiness. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He paid $500 \neach month in May 2009 and June 2009 on his past due or delinquent Sallie Mae \nstudent loans. Applicant has not successfully mitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n1 \n \nJuly 31, 2009\n\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 27, 2009, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial \nproblems as evicenced by delinquent debts. \n  \n \nOn April 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nApril 30, 2009, I was assigned the case. On May 19, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on June 16, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through E , which were admitted into evidence.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nJuly 7, 2009, additional documents were received. There being no objection, the \nmaterial was admitted into evidence as Exs. F through J. On June 24, 2009, the \ntranscript (Tr.) was received. On June 30, 2009, the record closed. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied four debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d \nand 1.e) totaling approximately $2,000 and admitted the remaining factual allegations. \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted the $1,367 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), which had \nbeen placed for collection. (Tr. 29) Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are \nincorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old project manager who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since January 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor states, Applicant has excelled at his job due to his dedication and \nhard work. (Ex. I) The facility security officer (FSO) states, Applicant is a very \nresponsible individual who is diligent in security matters. (Ex. J)  \n \n \nPrior to college, Applicant worked for a company constructing tents and stages \nfor events and as a pipefitter. (Tr. 29) In 2002, Applicant sustained a back injury \npreventing him from continuing with manual labor. When injured, he was out of work for \nfour months. (Tr. 73) He reinjured his back in 2006, and was out of work for a week. (Tr. \n75) He then chose to attended college pursuing an architectural degree, which he \nreceived in December 2005. (Ex. 1) Due to a paperwork problem, he did not receive his \ndiploma until August 2008. (Tr. 100) While in school, Applicant moved into his parent\u2019s \nhome, and his son, then age 5, went to live with his mother resulting in a child support \nobligation. (Tr. 32) As of July 2005, his child support was $395 per month. (Tr. 33, Ex. \nE)  \n \nApplicant is seeking custody of his son, now 11-years-old. A custody hearing will \nbe held in September 2009. (Tr. 33) Applicant estimates during the last 11 years he has \nspent between $25,000 and $30,000 in court costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to \ncustody and child support. (Tr. 71) Applicant\u2019s most current earnings statement (Ex. H) \nlists a $91.15 deduction for child support for a two-week period, which is less than his \n2 \n \n\nmonthly obligation. Applicant asserts he was current on his child support obligation \nwhen he talked to the department of child services a month ago. (Tr. 117)  \n \n \nWhile in college, Applicant started an internship at an architectural design firm \nand, in December 2005, started full-time employment with the firm. His starting pay was \napproximately $36,000, which had increased to $51,000 by the time he left. (Tr. 30, Ex. \nD) Applicant also worked part-time as a stage hand at concerts. (Tr. 72) In January \n2008, he obtained his current job and his current salary is approximately $72,000 a \nyear. (Tr. 30, Ex. A) His monthly income after taxes is approximately $3,400 of which he \nhas budgeted $1,000 each month to pay his student loans and other past due accounts. \n(Ex. B, Ex. H) The student loans were in forbearance through early 2009. In May 2009 \nand June 2009, he paid $500 each month on his student loan obligation. (Ex. F) He has \nalso budgeted $200 per month to repay his mother.  \n \nDuring college, Applicant had various part-time jobs working as a stagehand or \nworking as a doorman at bars and clubs. (Tr. 40-41) During college, he obtained \nstudent loans to cover the $28,000 in tuition and $10,000 to $12,000 tuition for summer \nclasses. (Tr. 29) Applicant\u2019s March 2008 and January 2009 credit bureau reports (CBR) \n(Ex. 2) lists numerous student loans. Those obligations are: a $4,903 university \ncollection account (SOR \u00b61.f); a $2,661 Department of Education collection account \n(SOR \u00b61.g); six Sallie Mae student loans (SOR \u00b61.h through \u00b61.m) 1.b) totaling more \nthan $88,000, which were more than 120 days past due; and a $26,000 student loan \nwith an educational loan company that had been placed for collection (SOR \u00b61.q). His \nCBR lists the monthly payment on the Sallie Mae student loans as $533. (Tr. 60, Ex. 2) \nApplicant asserted when he logged onto his Sallie Mae account the monthly amount \ndue was $378. (Tr. 64)  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated he had never heard of the educational loan \ncreditor listed in SOR \u00b61.q ($26,603). (Tr. 41) However, in February 2008, when he \ncompleted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), in \nresponse to question 28, he listed two delinquent student loans, one for $70,000 and \nthe other for $26,728. (Ex. 1) The two amounts for student loans are very close. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) lists the debt twice with a balance of \n$26,603 and $26,708. (Ex. 2) Applicant stated the student loan debt in SOR \u00b61.h \n($26,593) might be the same debt as listed in SOR \u00b61.q ($26,603), but provided no \ndocumentation. (Tr. 48) Both debts remain unpaid. (Tr. 48)  \n \nAfter finishing college in 2005, Applicant asserts he consolidated his student \nloans. As of June 2009, Applicant owed Sallie Mae $62,489. (Ex. F) There is no \nshowing which student loans are included in this amount. Nor is there any \ndocumentation showing the $26,000 student loan with an educational loan company \n(SOR \u00b61.q) was consolidated into the Sallie Mae debt. Applicant acknowledges the \n$4,903 university collection account (SOR \u00b61.f) and the $2,661 the Department of \nEducation collection account (SOR \u00b61.g) are not included in the Sallie Mae debt \nconsolidation. (Tr. 111)  \n3 \n \n\nApplicant\u2019s monthly payment on the $4,900 university loan is $300. (Tr. 85) He \nhas made some payments on this debt and said he could provide a payment history. \n(Tr. 85) No history was received.  \n \n \nWhile in college, Applicant had credit cards, which he thought he had paid. One \ndebt is listed twice in the SOR. A collection agency is attempting to collect a $1,367 \ndebt (SOR \u00b61.e), which is the $1,102 credit card debt (SOR \u00b61.p). (Tr. 49) A different \ncredit card company obtained a 2005 judgment for $1,068 (SOR \u00b61.n), a 2004 judgment \nfor $2,593 (SOR \u00b61.o), and wrote off a $4,527 account (SOR \u00b61.c). Applicant stated he \nnever had that many credit cards with this creditor, but had failed to contact the credit \ncard company about any the debts. (Tr. 56)  \n \n \nApplicant denied owing a $395 debt (SOR \u00b61.d) that a collection agency is \nattempting to collect on a telephone account that was placed for collection. Applicant did \nnot contact the collection agency to discuss or challenge the debt. (Tr. 60)  \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant informed his roommate of two years that he was \nleaving the first of the year. (Tr. 88, 120) They had a month-to-month lease. (Tr. 120) \nHis roommate demanded an additional $750 the week before Applicant was to leave. \nWhen Applicant did not pay the money, his roommate changed the locks. Applicant \nincurred unexpected expenses due to his roommate\u2019s conduct. (Tr. 88) Applicant \nintends to litigate the matter in court. (Tr. 89) During this period, Applicant borrowed \nmoney from his mother to pay his expenses, which he intends to pay back at $200 per \nmonth. (Ex. B) On February 1, 2009, Applicant and his sister rented a townhome, which \nthey share with her son. (Tr. 35, Ex. C) In order to save expenses, they entered into a \ntwo-year lease.  \n \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant received written interrogatories about his finances. \n(Ex. 4) At that time, he stated he had no information about the $242 (SOR \u00b61.a) medical \ndebt or the $40 (SOR \u00b61.b) medical debt that appear on his March 2008 CBR and \nJanuary 2009 CBR. (Ex. 2) At the hearing, Applicant had no information about the two \ndebts. (Tr. 50) He said he would contact the credit reporting agencies to dispute these \ndebts. (Tr. 55) No documentation concerning disputing of the debts has been received. \n \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant completed a monthly budget. (Ex. 2). His budget \nincluded a $500 monthly payment to Sallie Mae, $200 to the Department of Education, \nand $300 on his university account placed for collection. (Ex. 2) Applicant was not \nactually making payments on these obligations, but listed them because he \u201cmeant to \nstart payments.\u201d (Tr. 87) Applicant\u2019s monthly income after taxes and his child support \ndeduction is approximately $3,600 and his monthly expenses are $2,575 (Tr. 92), which \nleaves approximately $500 in discretionary income after paying his $500 per month \nSallie Mae debt. (Tr. 93)  \n \n \nApplicant has $300 in savings, $3,200 in his checking account, and thought his \n401(k) retirement plan might have a $20,000 balance, but provided no documentation. \n(Tr. 96) He has never received financial counseling.

The amount \nof the student loans as listed in his \nCBRs is $88,219. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n6 \n \n\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of \nfinancial problems. The SOR lists two unpaid judgments and 15 accounts which were \ndelinquent or placed for collection, which total approximately $48,000. Applicant has six \npast due or delinquent Sallie Mae student loans. The amount past due or delinquent \n7 \n \n\nwas approximately $2,500 on six loans totaling more than $88,000. Since receiving the \nSOR, Applicant has made two payments of $500 each on his delinquent student loans. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nSince graduating from college in December 2005, Applicant has been employed \nfull-time. He currently makes $72,000 a year. Even though he has been employed for \nthree and a half years, he has paid only $1,000 on his student loan obligation and has \nmade no payments on his two unpaid judgments and nine additional past-due, charged-\noff, or collection accounts. These debts total in excess of $45,000.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant=s financial problems were mainly incurred \nduring college which ended in December 2005. His delinquent, charged-off, and \ncollection accounts are both recent and numerous. It is unlikely he will incur additional \nstudent loans, but the remainder of the SOR debts are credit card accounts and medical \ndebts, which are the types of debt likely to recur.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. Following a personal injury, Applicant decided \nto go to college. The choice resulted in his son having to live with his ex-wife and a child \nsupport obligation commencing. Additionally, he was out of work four months following \nhis injury. The injury and his son not being able to live with him were conditions beyond \n8 \n \n\nhis control. However, only $1,000 has been paid on his debts and those payments were \nmade recently.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has not received any financial \ncounseling and with two months payments made on his student loans it is too soon to \nfind there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to Applicant\u2019s Fannie Mae student loans and then only \npartially applies because he has only recently made two month\u2019s worth of payments. If \npayments continue this would constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve the debts. This is not a long track record. He says he will continue to \nhis payments. However, in January 2009, when Applicant completed a monthly budget \nhe indicated he was paying three student loans when in fact he was merely intending to \npay and was not actually making payment.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d in financial cases \nstating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted \nthat the concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an \napplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid \noff each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has . . . \u2018established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the \npayment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement \nthat the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan \nbe the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  Applicant denied three of the SOR debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n$242, SOR \u00b6 1.b, $40, and SOR \u00b6 1.d, $395), which total less than $700. However, he \nhas not contacted the creditors concerning these debts nor challenged them with the \ncredit reporting agencies. They appear on his CBRs. Additionally, Applicant has failed to \nestablish the educational loan corporation debt (SOR \u00b6 1.q, $26,603) is a part of his \nconsolidated Sallie Mae student loans. Applicant has failed to establish there is a \n9 \n \n\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts nor has he provided \nany documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The majority of the debt was student \nloans, which is a proper investment in one\u2019s future.  \n \nApplicant has recently started to make payments on his Sallie Mae student loans. \nThe amount delinquent or past due on the Sallie Mae loans was approximately $2,500. \nThe total amount of the loans was in excess of $88,000. Of course, the issue is not \nsimply whether all his debts are paid or are being paid\u2014it is whether his financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(a)(1)) He has paid $1,000 on his student loans. However, he owes more than $45,000 \nin other delinquent debt on which he has made no payments. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \n10 \n \n\n11 \n \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at \nthis time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAgainst APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h\u20141.m:   \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n\u20141.q: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 18, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Rita C. O\u2019Brien\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her evaluation\n\nThe Judge stated that she was considering the purchase of these two unalleged properties as part of the whole\n1\nperson analysis.

Finding\nno error, we affirm.\nApplicant began working for Federal contractors in 2001 in the field of information systems\nsecurity.  He began working for his current employer, a Defense contractor, in 2008.  He is married\nwith four children, two of which are from a previous marriage.  He served in the Navy from 1995\nto 1999, receiving his first security clearance during that time.  \nHe started investing in real estate in 2005.  He purchased an undeveloped lot (Lot A) for\n$186,000, financing 100% of the purchase.  Later that year he purchased a house for $660,000,\nfinancing 100% of the price by means of two mortgages.  The Judge also found that Applicant\npurchased two other properties, which were not alleged in the SOR.  Both were undeveloped lots,\nalthough he built a house on one.   \n1\nApplicant subsequently put Lot A up for sale.  This was done in 2005, even though he\ntestified that he had purchased it as a long-term investment.  He was unsuccessful in his attempts to\nsell Lot A.  In 2007, his wife gave birth to twins, which affected his financial situation.  He became\nunable to pay his mortgages and contacted his creditors to see if he could work out a favorable\nresolution.  Although the lender for Lot A and the lender on the first mortgage for his house were\nwilling to negotiate loan modifications, the lender on the second mortgage on the house was not. \nApplicant used credit cards to help with his mortgage payments, as well as a personal loan\nto the same effect.  He entered into a contract with a consumer credit agency to assist him in settling\nhis delinquent credit card debts.  Additionally, on the advice of an attorney, Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  He was discharged in bankruptcy just prior to the hearing in his\ncase.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of his job performance, for his\ntrustworthiness, and for his integrity. \nIn the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge stated, \nWhen Applicant purchased properties that were beyond his ability to afford, even\nwith his substantial salary, he was not acting reasonably . . . His speculating was\nneither prudent nor successful.  It led to bankruptcy and the loss of his family\u2019s\nhome.  Applicant\u2019s past risky conduct, and his contradictory testimony, indicate a\nlack of credibility, reliability, and good judgment.  Overall, doubts remain as to\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.  Decision at 7-8, 9.  \n\nAccordingly, the Judge denied Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance.   \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Specifically, he contends that\nthe Judge erred in concluding that he had given inconsistent reasons during the hearing for having\nmade the real estate purchases at issue here.  We have considered Applicant\u2019s argument in light of\nthe record.  Applicant testified that he purchased the properties as investments for his retirement and\nhis children\u2019s education. Tr. at 35.  He also testified that he intended to \u201cflip\u201d the properties to make\nmoney (Tr. at 78), which is not totally consistent with the previous statement.  Additionally,\nApplicant\u2019s attempt to explain his reasons for the purchases was somewhat confusing.  Tr. at 77.\nWe find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.    \nApplicant draws attention to record evidence that he has held a security clearance for many\nyears without incident or concern.  The Judge was required to consider this, along with all the other\nevidence in the record.  However, the government need not wait until an individual mishandles or\nfails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable security clearance\ndecision.  ISCR Case No. 08-00435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2009), citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d\n230, 238-239 (D. C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Applicant cites to new evidence\nin support of his appeal.  For example, he has attached to his Appeal Brief a timeline charting the\ncollapse of the U.S. housing market circa 2007.  However, we cannot consider this new evidence.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).\nSee also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2\n(App. Bd.

However, each case must be decided\nupon its own merits.  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2 (b).  Moreover, Hearing Office decisions are binding\nneither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App.\nBd. Feb. 5, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s case has significant differences from those which he cites, in terms\nof the extent of his mortgage indebtedness and his substantial credit card debt as well.  \nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

Mardulla, Esquire \n \n \n \n________________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the \nguideline for financial considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 17, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn July 9, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865 and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nMarch 18, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on August 20, 2009. Of the nine allegations in \nthe SOR, he admitted to six. He denied allegation 1.c. As to allegation 1.g., he admitted \nin part and denied in part. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 16, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on September 21, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nOctober 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 17, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered five exhibits, which I admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant testified, presented one witness, and \noffered 14 exhibits, admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through N. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on November 23, 2010. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling  \n \nI held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation \nshowing his contacts with his creditors before he filed a bankruptcy petition in July 2009. \nApplicant timely submitted 35 documents, which I admit, over Department Counsel\u2019s \nobjection, as AE O through WW.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 37 years old. He married in 1995, and divorced in 2002. He re-\nmarried in November 2005, and has four children. From 1995 to 1999, he was an \nenlisted member of the U.S. Navy. He received his first security clearance while in the \nNavy. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice in 1995, and a master\u2019s degree \nin public administration in 1999. He worked for a federal agency as a police officer from \n1999 to 2001, holding a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) \nsecurity clearance. He began working for federal contractors in 2001, in information \nsystems security. In May 2008, he began his current position as senior associate with a \ndefense contractor. His job involves ensuring that security rules and regulations are \nfollowed. He has been continuously employed for at least the past ten years. (GE 1; Tr. \n27-32) \n \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3 \n                                                \nApplicant started investing in real estate in 2005. (Tr. 35) He testified that he had \na \u201cfairly extensive history of buying real estate.\u201d3 In January 2005, he purchased an 11-\nacre undeveloped lot (Lot A) for $186,000 (allegation 1.a.), financing 100 percent of the \nloan. Later that year, in August 2005, he bought his primary residence for $660,000. He \nfinanced 100 percent of the loan, with a first mortgage of $528,000 and a second \nmortgage of approximately $164,000, with the additional amount covering closing costs \nand points (allegations 1.b. and 1.c.). (Tr. 58-59, 61, 70-71) \n \nWhen Applicant bought Lot A in January 2005, he paid $186,000, but its \nappraised value was between $228,000 (Tr. 35) and $256,000 (Answer). Applicant \ntestified that his \u201c\u2026goal was to hang on to it as long as I could for--just like I said--for \nmy kids' education and mine and my wife's retirement.\u201d (Tr. 33, 35) He also testified that \nLot A was a long-term investment and that he planned to build a house on it to live in \nduring the week, and then stay at his other property on weekends. (AE F; Tr. 71-72) \nHowever, he put Lot A up for sale in 2005, the year he bought it, for $256,000 (Answer).  \n \nDepartment Counsel asked Applicant if he had considered the cost of his real \nestate investments: \n \nQ: \nHad you ever done a calculation as to what the mortgage costs, \nthe carrying costs on these properties would be, before you bought the \nthird and fourth properties? \n \nA: \nYes; yes.  My--the--at this--when I--after I bought the properties, I \ndid--I did do that.  But I thought that I could, with the market the way it \nwas at the time, I could flip those and make, actually make some money \noff of them and then buy down the house in [city].  And obviously that \ndidn't happen.  \n. \nQ: \nSo your strategy changed from being a long-term investor to a \nspeculator, basically? \n \n \nA: \nYes. \n \n \nQ: \nTo try to make a quick profit on that\u2014 \n \n \n3 Applicant bought a house during his first marriage. He then owned a condominium from 2003 to 2005. \n(Tr. 57-58) He bought Lot A as well as his primary residence in 2005. In the fall of 2006, he bought an \nundeveloped lot (Lot B) for $273,000, which appraised for $320,000. (Tr. 36) He obtained 100% \nfinancing. (Tr. 72) He began trying to sell it in 2006 or 2007, but was unsuccessful. It was foreclosed, and \nis included in the bankruptcy. (AE E) In 2006, Applicant purchased a lot, and had a house built on it \n(Lot/house C) (Tr. 74-75). He lived in this house from 2007 to 2008. (GE 1) He obtained 100% financing \nfor this purchase: a first mortgage of $468,000 and a second mortgage of $116,000, for total \nindebtedness of $584,000. This property was foreclosed and sold for $300,000. (Tr. 63-64, 68) The debts \nrelated to Lot B and Lot/house C, are not alleged in the SOR. They are listed here to facilitate \nconsideration under the whole person analysis. \n\n \n \n4 \nA: \nYes. (Tr. 78) \n \n \nAlthough the assessed value of Lot A continued to rise through 2008, Applicant \nreceived no offers. (Answer; AE F; Tr. 35) He persistently tried to sell the land for \nseveral years through advertisements, realtors, and builders. He was unsuccessful. (Tr. \n36-37) In 2007, Applicant's wife had twins. This unexpected event resulted in additional \nexpenses and reduced income. Eventually, Applicant was unable to carry the payments \non his mortgages. About 6 months to 12 months before he reached this point, he \ncontacted his lenders. However, none would work with him on alternate loan \narrangements (Tr. 41). When he started to miss payments (Tr. 40), they did respond. \nThe lender who held his mortgage on Lot A (allegation 1.a.) agreed to a loan \nmodification that lowered his payments (AE S). The lender also accept a \u201cshort sale,\u201d in \nwhich the lot would be sold for less than the mortgage loan balance. Applicant also was \nable to negotiate a loan modification from the lender who held the first mortgage on his \nresidence (allegation 1.b.). This change reduced his monthly payment on that mortgage \nby half for a period of six months. (Tr. 82) However, the holder of the second mortgage \non his residence (allegation 1.c.) would not agree to a loan modification. (Tr. 40-41) \nApplicant had arrears on his residence mortgage, but kept up the payments, and the \nprimary residence mortgage was not foreclosed. (GE 2; AE S, MM \u2013 SS; Tr. 49, 55, 82)  \n \n \nApplicant obtained a personal loan of $40,813 to help with his mortgage \npayments (allegation 1.d). He also used credit cards for the same purpose. These credit \ncard accounts, listed at allegations 1.e. through 1.i., total approximately $71,000. In July \n2008, Applicant signed a contract with a consumer credit agency to represent him in \nnegotiations to settle his delinquent credit card accounts. Applicant agreed to pay $745 \nper month into an account to be used to pay the settlements. In spring 2009, the agency \nsettled one account of $2,641 (allegation 1.i.). The remaining four credit card accounts \nalleged in the SOR were not paid or settled. Applicant does not currently use credit \ncards. He has also retained a credit monitoring service to keep abreast of his debts. His \nOctober 2009 credit bureau report shows no delinquent credit card or installment \naccounts. (GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE D, M; Tr. 42-43, 46, 50, 52) \n \nIn July 2008, at about the same time as he worked with the consumer credit \nagency, he contacted an attorney for advice. The attorney proposed that he file a \nbankruptcy petition. Applicant preferred not to file for bankruptcy because he feared it \nwould jeopardize his security clearance. However, in July 2009, Applicant and his wife \nfiled a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The petition includes the unpaid SOR debts listed \nat allegations 1.a through 1.h. Applicant surrendered his primary residence in the \nbankruptcy petition. He decided not to reaffirm this debt because the house was \u201ctoo far \nunderwater\u201d that is, he owed about $660,000 but the market value was approximately \n$450,000. He and his family moved to a rental property. The bankruptcy discharged his \ndebts in November 2009. (AE N; Tr. 37-39, 82)  \n \nAs to financial counseling, Applicant considered learning about financial planning \nand budgeting, but decided that it was too costly. In June and August 2009, he \n\n \n \n5 \n                                                \ncompleted the two-part online credit counseling that is required as part of the \nbankruptcy process. As of the date of the hearing, he had enrolled in a course \nsponsored by his church that teaches family financial planning. He expected to begin \nthe course in 2010. (AE B, C, E, N; Tr. 44, 48-49, 88)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2007gross annual salary was $206,103. In 2008, Applicant earned \n$193,770. His 2009 gross income was approximately $175,000. His wife earned \napproximately $17,000, in both 2007 and in 2008. In 2009, she worked in sales, and \nearned an income that fluctuated between $48,000 and $60,000. Applicant testified that, \ncurrently, he has a positive cash flow and his only debts are his wife\u2019s school loans and \na car loan of $8,000. (AE H, I; Tr. 48-49)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness is his subordinate at their current employment. He has known \nApplicant for four years and is aware of Applicant's financial problems. He testified that \nApplicant is goal-oriented, methodical, and trustworthy, and has never ignored rules or \nregulations. (AE L; Tr. 23- 25) Another subordinate, who is also a friend, submitted a \nreference letter. He has known Applicant for two years, and stated that Applicant \nmentioned his financial problems, but did not let it interfere with his work ethic. He \nbelieves Applicant to have integrity, and to be trustworthy and loyal. Applicant's current \nsupervisor provided a letter that attests to Applicant's honesty and integrity. He notes \nthat Applicant has consistently followed the rules relating to classified information. \nApplicant has kept his supervisor aware of his financial situation. Another co-worker \nstated that Applicant has developed cost-saving projects for federal agencies and \nimproved security standards. His co-worker is aware of Applicant's financial situation \nand believes Applicant would never allow himself to be blackmailed. (AE J, K, L) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised AG.4 \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of \nthe AG. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).   \n \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n6 \n                                                \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nApplicant began investing in real estate when the market was booming in the \nmid-2000s. In 2005, he bought a house as a primary residence for $660,000, as well \nas an undeveloped 11-acre lot for $186,000. The mortgage loans, totalling $846,000, \nwere 100 percent financed. He put the lot up for sale the year he bought it. He had no \noffers and was unable to keep up with the loan payments. He also could not manage \nthe payments on his house, and eventually put his primary residence up for sale as \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7 \nwell. When he could no longer meet his mortgage payments on his income, he \nobtained a personal loan of almost $41,000. He also used credit cards to make \nmortgage payments, which resulted in approximately $70,000 in delinquent credit card \naccounts. The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b619 apply: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \n \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains conditions that can \nmitigate security concerns. The following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant's delinquencies are not distant in time, as \nthey were discharged in bankruptcy in November 2009, only four months ago. His \nfinancial speculating raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  \n \n \nThe real estate market was booming when Applicant bought Lot A and his \nprimary residence in 2005. The market crash only had a negative effect on his financial \nsituation from approximately 2007-2008. Applicant's wife\u2019s pregnancy with twins in \n2007 did result in twice the expected expenses, as well as the loss of his wife\u2019s \nincome. Applicant had no way to foresee the crash, or the advent of twins. Therefore, \nstarting in 2007, he was affected by events beyond his control. However, his financial \nproblems began in 2005, when his own disregard for a sound and reasonable \napproach to investing initiated his financial problems. When Applicant purchased \n\n \n \n8 \n                                                \nproperties that were beyond his ability to afford, even with his substantial salary, he \nwas not acting reasonably. AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot be applied. \n \n \nApplicant receives credit in mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c), which requires financial \ncounseling or indications that the problem is resolved. Applicant hired a credit repair \nagency in 2008, through which he paid one SOR debt; he also contacted an attorney \nfor advice on how he should proceed; and he completed the financial planning course \nthat is required of those who file bankruptcy.  \n \n \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to repay debts. The \nAppeal Board has defined \u201cgood faith\u201d as acting in a way that shows \u201creasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d In the same decision, the \nBoard held that, \u201cAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or \nshe relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the \nbenefit of [this mitigating condition].8 Although Applicant made efforts to sell the \nproperties, his imprudent assumption of excessive debt led him to a situation where, \nultimately, his only recourse was bankruptcy. Although it is a legitimate option to \nresolve overwhelming debt, it does not qualify under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nas a good-faith effort. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is \nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the applicable guideline in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \n8 ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004), quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. \nBd. June 4, 2001). \n\n \n \n9 \n \nWhen Applicant began investing in real estate, he was a mature adult, a \nhusband, and the father of four children. He purchased numerous properties between \napproximately 2001 and 2007 and admits that he had an extensive history of buying \nreal estate. When the real estate market was experiencing a boom, Applicant was able \nto buy properties with 100 percent financing. At one point, in 2007, he carried the \nfollowing debt: Lot A ($186,000); Lot B ($273,000); Lot C/house ($584,000); and his \nprimary residence ($660,000). It was financially irresponsible to carry such a burden, \neven with a substantial income. \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant offered contradictory reasons for his investment \nchoices. He first characterized his purchases as long-term investments to fund his \nchildren\u2019s education, and to have land on which to build homes for his family. He \nbought Lot A in 2005, and began trying to sell it the same year at a substantially higher \nprice. He began trying to sell Lot B after holding it for approximately one year. When \nquestioned by Department Counsel, he admitted that he thought he could \u201cflip\u201d the \nproperties to \u201cmake some money.\u201d His speculating was neither prudent nor successful. \nIt led to bankruptcy and the loss of his family\u2019s home. Applicant's past risky conduct, \nand his contradictory testimony, indicate a lack of credibility, reliability, and good \njudgment.   \n \n \nOverall, doubts remain as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant   \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR is comprised of 19 allegations that raise trustworthiness concerns under AG F, Financial Considerations. Eighteen allegations raised financial delinquency concerns totaling $34,443, and one allegation recited that Applicant, who petitioned for bankruptcy in October 2005, received a discharge in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2006. (Item 1.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted her 2006 discharge in bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and eight financial delinquencies totaling $30,449 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.f., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.m., 1.p., and 1.s.); she denied five debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.i., 1.n., 1.q., and 1.r.).

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \nI have carefully reviewed the administrative file, pleadings, and exhibits in this \ncase and conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under the \nFinancial Considerations adjudicative guideline. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) on May 20, \n2008. On April 9, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nOn June 15, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. She requested that \nher case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its \n1 \n \nDecember 21, 2010\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2010. The FORM contained \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 10. By letter dated September 10, 2010, a copy \nof the Form was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional \ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on \nSeptember 26, 2010. Her response to the FORM was due on October 26, 2010. She did \nnot file any additional information or objections within the required time period. The case \nwas assigned to me for a decision on December 8, 2010. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR is comprised of 19 allegations that raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG F, Financial Considerations. Eighteen allegations raised financial delinquency \nconcerns totaling $34,443, and one allegation recited that Applicant, who petitioned for \nbankruptcy in October 2005, received a discharge in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February \n2006. (Item 1.) \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted her 2006 discharge in bankruptcy \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and eight financial delinquencies totaling $30,449 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.f., 1.h., \n1.j., 1.k., 1.m., 1.p., and 1.s.); she denied five debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.i., 1.n., 1.q., and \n1.r.). She gave qualified admissions to five allegations, which the Government \nconsidered to be de facto denials (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.g., 1.l., and 1.o.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are entered as findings of fact. (Item 4 at 4-6.) \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old, never married, and the parent of two children, a \ndaughter who is approximately 17 years old, and a son who is approximately eleven \nyears old.1 She is a high school graduate and completed one year of junior college \nstudy. She recently joined a National Guard unit. (Item 4 at 4; Item 5; Item 7.) \n \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant was unemployed for two months in 2008 before \nassuming her current job. She was also unemployed for three months in 2007. Since \nMay 2008, she has been employed in customer service by a Government contractor. \nShe seeks a trustworthiness determination for the first time. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. The SOR alleges that \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.). When she filed for bankruptcy in 2005, Applicant reported total assets of $1,367 \nand total liabilities of $195,378. In a November 2008 interview with an authorized \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), she reported that \nshe was living \u201cpaycheck to paycheck,\u201d but staying current with her bills. Her credit \nbureau report of May 2008 revealed that Applicant owed an automobile creditor \napproximately $16,514 resulting from an automobile repossession. In April 2009, in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged the debt and stated: \u201cI am \nnegotiating payment amount. I do not owe this much. Waiting for itemized list of \ncharges. Company is not cooperating with me.\u201d The delinquent debt, which grew to \n$19,579 and which also appears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports of March 2010 and \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s Schedule I on her 2005 bankruptcy petition lists her children\u2019s ages as 12 and six, as of \nNovember 9, 2005. She did not list her children on her SF-85P. (Item 5 at 5; Item 7 at 42.) \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \nSeptember 2010, is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthat the debt had not been satisfied. Additionally, Applicant asserted that she was \npaying the creditor $580 a month by payroll allotment. However, she failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate her assertion. (Item 4 at 5; Item 6 at 25; Item 7 at 16; Item \n8 at 1; Item 9 at 1; Item 10.) \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a delinquent debt of $600 but failed \nto provide documentation corroborating payment. The record does not establish that the \ndebt, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c., has been satisfied. (Item 4 at 4.) \n \nApplicant admitted a $393 debt in collection status (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) and a $8,997 \ncharged-off debt (SOR \u00b6 1.s.).She stated she was \u201cworking on paying\u201d the debt alleged \nat SOR \u00b6 1.f. and was paying $100 monthly on the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.s. However, \nshe failed to provide documentation to corroborate her claims of payment. (Item 4 at 4-\n6.) \n \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h., 1.j., and 1.p. She stated \nthat she would pay those debts in the future. She also admitted the delinquent debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.m. and stated she \u201cneed[ed] to do some research to find out how to \npay this debt off.\u201d 2(Item 4 at 5-6.) \n \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.g., 1.l., and 1.o. She \nstated further that the debts were hers but had been paid. Applicant\u2019s admissions were \ntreated as de facto denials. However, Applicant failed to provide documentation \ncorroborating her assertions that the debts had been paid. (Item 4 at 4-5.) \n \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. She asserted that the debt had \nbeen discharged in her 2006 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. I also treated this admission as a \nde facto denial. The record includes the Schedule F (Creditors Holding Unsecured \nNonpriority Claims) that Applicant filed in her bankruptcy case. The debt listed in SOR \nallegation 1.d. does not appear on Applicant\u2019s Schedule F or on other bankruptcy \nschedules listing debts owed to other classes of creditors.3 However, the debt listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. appears on Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 30, 2008. The credit report \nshows the debt arose in 2007, after Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged in the 2006 \nbankruptcy. (Item 4 at 4; Item 7; Item 10 at 10.)  \n \nApplicant denied the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.i., 1.n., 1.q., and 1.r. In her personal \nsubject interview in November 2008, Applicant stated she did not recognize the $60 \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. but would contact the creditor and pay the debt if she owed it.  \nThe debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.i. appear on Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 30, \n2008. The debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n. and 1.q. are listed are listed on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports of March 12, 2010, and September 9, 2010. The delinquent debt alleged \n \n2 The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h. is for $72. The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j. is for $60. The debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. is for $40. \n \n3 See  Item 7, Schedules D and E, at 23-27. \n\n4 \n \n4, 26.) \n                                                          \nat SOR \u00b6 1.r. is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report of March 12, 2010. (Item 4 at 4-6; Item \n6 at 24; Item 8; Item 9; Item 10.)       \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories and an inquiry by the OPM investigator, \nApplicant provided personal financial information. Her net monthly income includes her \ntake-home pay of $1,743 and $200 in child support, for a total of $1,943.4 Her fixed \nmonthly living expenses total approximately $1,761 and are as follows: rent: $600; \ngroceries: $200-$250; utilities: $150; cell phone: $140; gasoline: $160; auto loan: $386; \nand auto insurance: $100. Additionally, she reported that she paid $300 each month on \ntwo debts.5 Applicant\u2019s financial information indicates that her monthly expenses \nexceed her regular monthly income by approximately $124. (Item 6 at 10, 2\n \nThe record does not establish that Applicant has had financial counseling.  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAGs. The guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, the administrative judge must apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n \n4 Applicant stated that she worked overtime when the opportunity was available to her. She reported she \ncould earn $200 to $400 in extra overtime income each month. (Item 6 at 25.)  \n \n5 It is not clear from the record how Applicant\u2019s current finances are affected by the $580 payroll allotment \nshe stated in her Answer to the SOR that she was paying to satisfy the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.k. \n(Item 4 at 5.) \n\n5 \n \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \ntrustworthiness concerns. While Applicant admitted allegations of financial delinquency \non the SOR and claimed to have satisfied several other alleged delinquent debts, she \nprovided no documentation to corroborate payment or to establish that the alleged \n\n6 \n \ndebts were not hers. Moreover, she denied several debts alleged on the SOR which \nwere listed on her credit reports. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted.) Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her \ncredit reports, her SF 85P, her interview with the OPM investigator, and her SOR \nresponse. In 2006, Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Since \nabout 2007, Applicant accumulated considerable delinquent debt and was unable to pay \nor satisfy her financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions identified at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the \ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nApplicant=s current financial delinquencies began in about 2007. While her financially \ndelinquent behavior began several years ago, it continues unresolved at the present \ntime, is likely to recur, and casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b620(a) does not apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation can occur where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s admitted \nfinancial delinquencies began in 2007 and continue to the present. While Applicant was \nunemployed for two months in 2008 and three months in 2007, she offered no \nexplanation for her failure to resolve or settle her financial delinquencies during the past \n2\u00bd years when she has been steadily employed. I conclude that she failed to act \nresponsibly in identifying and resolving her debts, some of which were for small \namounts. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies only in part as a factor for consideration in this \ncase.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant failed to provide documentation to corroborate her \n\n7 \n \nstatements that she had paid or was paying delinquent debts alleged on the SOR. The \nrecord does not reflect that she has received financial counseling. Moreover, her current \nmonthly budget shows a deficit of approximately $124, making consistent future \npayments unlikely. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (e) and 20 (f) are not raised by the facts of this \ncase. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In 2006, Applicant received a fresh \nstart under the bankruptcy law to follow a financially prudent course and satisfy her \ndebts in a timely manner. She has had a steady job with the same employer for over 2 \nyears. Since 2007, she has accumulated over $30,000 in new delinquent debts. She \nhas failed to demonstrate that her financial problems will not continue to be a \ntrustworthiness concern in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.s.: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 28-year-old processing engineer employed by a defense contractor since September 2008. He has not previously held a clearance. December 29, 2009 2 The SOR alleges, government exhibits confirm, and Applicant admits, a single delinquent collection account of about $16,000. The debt originated as education loans Applicant took out while he was in college. Applicant received his undergraduate degree in June 2005. After a six-month grace period, he should have begun repayment on the loan, but did not. Three factors contributed to his failure to begin repayment. First, he graduated from college without a job and was underemployed once he obtained employment. Second, he was unaware of the provisions of his loan that might have provided deferment or forbearance of repayment because of his financial situation. Finally\u2014and most important\u2014he was financially immature and simply did not comprehend the ramifications of his financial irresponsibility. Consequently, he let his education loan go into default. Applicant\u2019s financial naivete extended to other areas of his life. He opened credit card accounts without considering his ability to repay the accounts. Facing layoff from his employment, he stopped paying on the cards, which also fell delinquent.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 4 August 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant answered the SOR 1 September 2009, requesting a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 28 August 2009, and I convened a hearing 28 October 2009.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 3 November 2009.\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 28-year-old processing engineer\nemployed by a defense contractor since September 2008. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\nDecember 29, 2009\n\n2\nThe SOR alleges, government exhibits confirm, and Applicant admits, a single\ndelinquent collection account of about $16,000. The debt originated as education loans\nApplicant took out while he was in college.\nApplicant received his undergraduate degree in June 2005. After a six-month\ngrace period, he should have begun repayment on the loan, but did not. Three factors\ncontributed to his failure to begin repayment. First, he graduated from college without a\njob and was underemployed once he obtained employment. Second, he was unaware\nof the provisions of his loan that might have provided deferment or forbearance of\nrepayment because of his financial situation. Finally\u2014and most important\u2014he was\nfinancially immature and simply did not comprehend the ramifications of his financial\nirresponsibility. Consequently, he let his education loan go into default.\nApplicant\u2019s financial naivete extended to other areas of his life. He opened credit\ncard accounts without considering his ability to repay the accounts. Facing layoff from\nhis employment, he stopped paying on the cards, which also fell delinquent. He was\nunemployed from February to September 2008, which exacerbated his financial\nproblems.\nAfter he obtained full-time employment in September 2008, Applicant began to\nrealize he would have to deal with his financial problems. However, he waited until he\nhad saved some money before approaching his creditors. He eventually settled some\noutstanding accounts and brought other accounts current. His credit reports reflect\nnumerous accounts that were delinquent, but are now current.\nApplicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement with the creditor holding his\neducation loan. His initial loan balance was about $25,000, but capitalized interest\nincreased the balance to just over $28,000. However, in a year\u2019s time, Applicant\nreduced the balance to just over $17,000 (AE C). At the time of the hearing, Applicant\nhad rehabilitated the loan, which was then transferred to a different lender to resume\nnormal payments. Nevertheless, as of the date of the hearing, Applicant had missed the\npayment date for the new lender by two weeks.\nApplicant began his loan rehabilitation in December 2008 with a lump-sum\npayment of $3,000-4,000, followed by monthly payments of $500. His new monthly\npayment amount was $160, but Applicant intended to continue the $500 monthly\npayment. His post-hearing submission (AE D) reflects that he made the first payment\nelectronically at the end of October 2009, and had submitted the necessary paperwork\nto start automatic monthly deductions from his checking account. Meanwhile, he\nintended to continue to make monthly electronic payments until the automatic payments\nbegan.\nApplicant\u2019s finances have improved to the point that he and his brother were able\nto jointly buy a house in 2009. His character references (AE A) consider him honest and\ntrustworthy.\n\n\u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n2\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the whole-person factors listed in RAG \u00b6\n2(a). The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed where a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy\nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering\nthe SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F.\nApplicant candidly acknowledged that he was financially naive and irresponsible coming\nout of college and let his education loan become delinquent. His financial situation was\nfurther eroded by a brief, but significant, period of unemployment.  However, when he\n2\nobtained full-time employment in his career field and realized the importance of\nstraightening out his finances, he embarked on a sensible plan to repair his credit, and\nhas largely executed that plan\u2014to the point where the only SOR allegation was his\ndelinquent education loan which had been referred for collection\nApplicant satisfies important aspects of the mitigating factors for financial\nconcerns. While his financial difficulties were both recent and multiple, they were\n\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n3\nit is  unlikely to recur .\n\u00b6 20 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n4\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20 (c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n5\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n\u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. For\n6\nthis factor to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-\nfaith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling his debt, which is present here as to his\nstudent loan.\n4\nconfined to a relatively short period.  The debts were largely not due to circumstances\n3\nbeyond his control, but he acted responsibly in addressing his debts once he obtained\npermanent employment in his career field.  Similarly, while he did not seek credit\n4\ncounseling, he pursued a responsible repayment program and has brought the problem\nunder control.  He also has a plan that addresses the remaining debt faster than the\n5\ncreditor requires. Further, the record reflects a good-faith effort to satisfy debts that\nwere not alleged in the SOR, as well as the single debt that was alleged.  I conclude\n6\nGuideline F for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG).\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 17, 2009, denying all of the allegations\nexcept SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, and 1.j. On December 15, 2009, the case was\nassigned to me. On January 13, 2010, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the\nMay 27, 2010\n\n2\ncase for February 3, 2010. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. I received six\nGovernment exhibits, twenty-nine Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant\nwitnesses. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at the end of the hearing for him\nto submit additional exhibits. He timely submitted three additional exhibits that I\nincorporated into the record. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 12, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old married man with three children ages 14, 12, and six.\nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management in 2002.

(Id. at 17) \nWhile Applicant was unemployed, he fell behind on his car payments and the\npayments on his mobile home. Subsequently, his car was repossessed and a judgment\nwas entered against him in the amount of $786 for his mobile home debt. (Answer to\nSOR subparagraph 1.a; AE S, respectively) The creditor resold the car, and Applicant\nowes a deficiency of $4,312.

Approximately $18,000 consisted of the deficiencies from the\nrepossessed automobiles, as described above, and the remainder was delinquent credit\ncard debts and utility bills.\nIn August 2008, Applicant began working for his current employer. His annual\nsalary increased from $25,500 to $67,000. (Tr. 88) Applicant then began methodically\nsatisfying his debts beginning with the smaller ones first.

(AE EE) He has approximately $1,522 in monthly\nafter-expense income and $2,000 in a 401k retirement plan. (Id.; Tr. 65) \nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process to evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s economic hardship was triggered by an employment layoff in 2001.\nAlthough he was only out of work for four months, he earned only a fraction of his pre-\nlayoff salary until he began working at his current job in 2008. Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were exacerbated in 2004 when his wife experienced a difficult pregnancy\nthat generated extensive medical bills. Under these circumstances, Applicant could not\nmake ends meet. He did, however, avail himself of assistance from a church-based\nsocial service organization, which helped him keep his mobile home. Also, a few years\nlater, he met with a credit counselor.\n\n5\nWhen Applicant left his previous employer for his current employer, he received a\n$42,000 annual pay raise. Since then, he has either paid or successfully disputed\napproximately $4,000 of SOR debt and $1,300 of unlisted debt.\nAlthough Applicant has made progress, more than 80 percent of his delinquent\ndebt remains outstanding. This amount composed of debt owed to four creditors, and\nhalf constitutes the deficiency from one automobile repossession. Applicant is actively\nattempting to resolve these delinquencies, and has ample disposable income available\nto follow through with any developed settlement plan. The following mitigating\nconditions, as set forth in AG \u00b6 20, are applicable:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were triggered by an unemployment and a medical\nemergency. As soon as his financial situation improved, he began satisfying his\ndelinquencies. Although approximately $24,000 of debt remains outstanding, I am\n\n6\nconfident that Applicant will satisfy this debt given the responsible manner he has\naddressed his delinquencies thus far, and the ample income in reserve that he\npossesses. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security\nconcern. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted 12 of the 30 factual allegations in the SOR. I included Applicant's admissions in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old and has been employed as a technician for a defense contractor for approximately two years. He is presently suspended awaiting a determination on his security clearance application. Applicant served four years on active duty with the Marines, four years on active duty with the Army, and two years in the Army Reserve for a total of ten years of military service. He held a security clearance up to top secret and access to sensitive compartmented information while serving on active duty. He was married in August 1998, divorced in November 2003, and remarried in July 2006. He is supporting two of his own children and three step- children. He pays child support for a child living with his first wife. When he was working, Applicant's monthly net pay was $2,200 and his wife's net monthly pay was $1,700. Applicant also receives $600 monthly in Veterans Administration (VA) disability, for a total family monthly income of $4,500. His monthly expenses are $3,900, leaving him with $600 monthly in disposable or discretionary funds.

After an investigation conducted \nby the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 6, 2009, to \nApplicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the \nSOR on November 24, 2009.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 22, 2009, admitting 12 and \ndenying 18 of the allegations under Guideline F. Applicant requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 5, \n2010, and the case was assigned to me on January 14, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nHearing on January 25, 2010, scheduling a hearing for March 9, 2010. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The government offered four exhibits, marked Government \nExhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his behalf. Applicant offered three exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. \nEx.) A through C, which were received without objection. I kept the record open for \nApplicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted three additional \nsets of documents marked App. Ex. D through F. Department counsel had no objection \nto the admission of the additional documents. (Gov. Ex. 5) DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on March 17, 2010. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted 12 of the 30 factual allegations in the SOR. I included \nApplicant's admissions in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, \ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and has been employed as a technician for a defense \ncontractor for approximately two years. He is presently suspended awaiting a \ndetermination on his security clearance application. Applicant served four years on \nactive duty with the Marines, four years on active duty with the Army, and two years in \nthe Army Reserve for a total of ten years of military service. He held a security \nclearance up to top secret and access to sensitive compartmented information while \nserving on active duty. He was married in August 1998, divorced in November 2003, \nand remarried in July 2006. He is supporting two of his own children and three step-\nchildren. He pays child support for a child living with his first wife. When he was \nworking, Applicant's monthly net pay was $2,200 and his wife's net monthly pay was \n$1,700. Applicant also receives $600 monthly in Veterans Administration (VA) disability, \nfor a total family monthly income of $4,500. His monthly expenses are $3,900, leaving \nhim with $600 monthly in disposable or discretionary funds. (Tr. 13-15, 23-26, 60-69)  \n \nApplicant admits that a check he wrote for $100 was dishonored for insufficient \nfunds (SOR 1.a). Credit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, dated May 16, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 4, dated \nJuly 22, 2009) show the following delinquent debts for Applicant: medical debts for $59 \n(SOR 1.b), $505 (SOR 1.c), $1,141 (SOR 1.d), $7,132 (SOR 1.e), $358 (SOR 1.h), \n$574 (SOR 1.l), $35 (SOR 1.n), $2,946 (SOR 1.q), $87 (SOR 1.r), and $111 (SOR 1.x); \nfor unpaid utility bills of $473 (SOR 1.f), $453 (SOR 1.k), and $73 (SOR 1.v); for unpaid \ncable service bills of $400 (SOR 1.g), and $413 (SOR 1.m); two unpaid car insurance \nbills of $82 (SOR 1.i), and $368 (SOR 1.y); $3,069 (SOR 1.j); an on-line dating service \ndebt of $13,000 (SOR 1.o), car repossession debts of $19,000 (SOR 1.p), and $4,577 \n(SOR 1.dd); a credit card debt of $705 (SOR 1.s); a judgment from an automobile \naccident of $65,796 (SOR 1.t); telephone service bills of $398 (SOR 1.u), $554 (SOR \n1.w), and $100 (SOR 1.z); a bank overdraft fee of $129 (SOR 1.aa); and two unpaid \nloans from the same lender for $625 (SOR 1.bb), and $1,071 (SOR 1.cc). The total \ndelinquent debt listed in the SOR is $123,000. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was stationed in a mid-Atlantic state on active duty with the Army. The \naccident that resulted in his biggest debt happened in that state. Applicant incurred \nmost of his delinquent debt when he relocated from one state where he was assigned \nfor military duty to his present location. When he moved, he was unable to find \nemployment sufficient to support his family. He worked more than one job to get funds \nto make debt payments. He worked in a convenience store and drove a tow truck. Since \nhe started working for the defense contractor with a sufficient steady income, he has not \naccumulated any additional delinquent debt, and has paid off the debts for two vehicles \nand other small debts. However, he has not been able to make payments on all of his \nprior delinquent debts. His intent is to pay all of his debts as he receives sufficient \nincome to make the payments. (Tr. 23-25) \n \nThe allegation in SOR 1.a is for a check Applicant gave his first wife for a partial \nchild support payment. Applicant told his wife not to present the check for payment for a \nfew days to ensure sufficient funds were in the account. Instead, his former wife \nimmediately presented the check for payment. The check was dishonored and his \nformer wife filed a criminal complaint for uttering a worthless check. Applicant paid the \njudgment and court costs. (Tr. 26-33, 70-71; App. Ex. A, Sheriff Letter of No Criminal \nHistory, dated February 3, 2010; App. Ex. D, Court Documents and Receipt, dated \nMarch 22, 2010) \n \nApplicant paid the $59 medical debt at SOR 1.b. (Tr. 34-35; Answer to SOR, e-\nmail receipt, dated November 24, 2009) The medical debt of $505 at SOR 1.c is for \nmedical treatment for his son's ear. Applicant did not have health insurance at the time. \nHe has not paid this debt. (Tr. 34-35) The medical debt of $1,140 at SOR 1.d is a result \nof medical treatment for Applicant's chest pains. He did not have health insurance at the \ntime. The debt has not been paid. (Tr. 35) \n \nThe medical debt of $7,132 at SOR 1.e and $358 at SOR 1.h resulted from an \naccident requiring Applicant to be evacuated by helicopter to a hospital. Applicant was \ndriving a vehicle for his employer when his vehicle was hit by another car. At the time of \nthe accident, Applicant was entitled to medical care from the VA because he is a \ndisabled veteran. Applicant disputed the debts since the medical costs and resulting \ndebt should have been paid either by his employer, workman's compensation, or the \nVA. The creditor is billing workman's compensation for the debt. (Tr. 35-39; App. Ex. E, \nHospital statement, undated) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.f is for electric utility service at Applicant's present \nlocation. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.k is for water service at the same location. \nApplicant does not dispute the debts but does dispute the amounts owed. The debts are \nvalid. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.m is for cable service at this address. Applicant \nreturned the equipment to the cable company. After Applicant moved to this address, he \ncould not afford to pay all of his debts as they were incurred, and he fell behind on his \nbills. The debts have not been paid, but Applicant is trying to make payment \narrangements with the creditors. (Tr. 39-40, 44-47) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.g is for cable service at Applicant's former \nresidence. Applicant paid the cable company $89 when he moved, but did not realize he \nstill owed the cable company $400. He has not paid the $400 debt. (Tr. 40-42; Gov. Ex. \n2, answers to Interrogatories. Date April 13, 2009, at 3)  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.i is for car insurance. It has been paid in full. (Tr. \n42-43; Answer to SOR, Bank statement, dated December 3, 2009, and e-mail \nconfirmation, dated December 2, 2009) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.j is fees associated with an on-line dating service. \nApplicant disputes this debt. Applicant stated he only gave the dating service \nauthorization to use his picture on their web site at no cost to him. He did not sign up \nand use the dating service. The dispute has not been resolved. (Tr. 43-44) \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.n, 1.q, and 1.r are medical debts. Applicant has \nno information on the debts or the creditors. The information in the credit reports is \ninsufficient for Applicant to learn about the debts. (Tr. 46-47, 50-51) Applicant paid the \nmedical debt listed at SOR 1.x in full. (Tr. 55; Answer to SOR, dated November 3, 2009, \nat 2, letter, dated November 25, 2009) \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.o and 1.p are for the debt remaining from car \nrepossessions. Applicant purchased the car listed at SOR debt 1.o after moving to his \npresent location. Since he did not find good employment, he was unable to make the \npayments. He does not dispute the debt but does dispute the amount of the debt. He \nhas not made payments on this debt. Applicant co-signed the purchase of the car listed \nat SOR 1.p for his girlfriend before he moved. She was to make the payments. His \ngirlfriend made a few payments but could not make further payments. She turned the \ncar back to the creditor. The creditor is seeking payment of the remainder from \nApplicant as co-signer on the note. He has not made any payments on this debt. (Tr. \n48-50) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.s is for a credit card Applicant used at his former \nlocation. He attempted to negotiate a settlement with the creditor but has not been \nsuccessful. He has not made any payments on this debt and still owes the full $705. (Tr. \n51-52) \n \nThe delinquent debt of $65,796 is for a judgment against Applicant for damage \nand injury resulting from an automobile accident that happened before Applicant moved. \nApplicant did not have the proper type of insurance on his own vehicle for the state \nwhere the vehicle was located. He cancelled the insurance he did have and did not \ndrive the vehicle. He was driving a vehicle he borrowed from a friend when he had the \naccident. Applicant had no automobile insurance, and his friend did not have insurance \non his vehicle. The judgment is for the payment of injury and damage to the other driver \ninvolved in the accident. Applicant has made only one payment of $1,000 on the \njudgment. He does not have sufficient funds to make any additional payments at this \ntime. (Tr. 25-29, 52, Answer to Interrogatories, dated April 13, 2009, at 2) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.u is for telephone service at Applicant's present \nlocation. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.z is for telephone service Applicant's former wife \nopened in his name at another location where they were stationed while Applicant was \non active duty. Both debts have been paid in full (Tr. 52-53, Answer to SOR, dated, \nNovember 3, 2009, at 5 and 6, Payment Receipts, dated December 3, 2009). Applicant \ndisputed the telephone service debt at SOR 1.w since he had terminated service with \nthe telephone company and the bills were current. The debt has been removed from his \ncredit report. (Tr. 54-55) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.v is for electrical utility service from Applicant's \nformer residence. Applicant notified the utility to terminate service because he was \nmoving. The utility did not timely stop service and he incurred additional charges. \nApplicant paid the current charges when he moved. He disputes this debt and it has not \nbeen paid. (Tr. 53-54) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.y is for car insurance owed on vehicles Applicant \nvoluntarily returned for repossession. The debt has not been paid. (Tr. 55-56) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.aa is for an overdrawn bank account. Applicant \nthought he paid the account but learned he still owed over $860. The account has not \nbeen paid. (Tr. 56-57)  \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.bb and 1.cc are loans opened with the same \ncreditor by his former wife in his name while they were married and he was serving \noverseas. When he returned from overseas, Applicant and his wife separated and he \nlearned of the loans. He set up an allotment to pay the loans. The loans are paid in full. \n(Tr. 57-58; App. Ex. F, Letters, dated March 15, 2010) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.dd is for a car Applicant purchased from the \ntowing and automotive company he worked for after moving. The car was purchased \nwith warranty from the employer. The car had high mileage, did not work well, and had \nto be repaired by the company. Applicant paid over $3,000 in repairs to the car before \nreturning it to his employer. He continued to work for them for another 18 months. When \nhe left the company, he was informed he owed over $4,500 for the car. After he \nreturned the car to the employer, it was sold to another person. He disputes that he \nowes this debt because of the warranty, the repairs made to the car, and its sale to \nanother person. (Tr. 58-60) \n \nApplicant was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army \nAchievement Medal, and two Good Conduct Medals during his active duty service in the \nArmy. (App. Ex. B, Award Certificates, various dates) Applicant's pastor notes that he \nhas known Applicant for over four years. Applicant is dedicated, dependable, honest, \ntrustworthy, and compassionate. Applicant was also commended by his local police \ndepartment for his involvement with youth activities. A police community relations \nspecialist has known Applicant for over five years when Applicant served as a youth \nfootball coach teaching the youth life skills. Applicant is a dedicated youth mentor. He \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconsiders Applicant to be a person of honesty and integrity. Applicant's former employer \nstates that he has known Applicant for over five years. When he was Applicant's \nsupervisor, Applicant was responsible for over $60,000 of cash and equipment. \nApplicant proved himself to be reliable, dependable and honest. He required very little \nsupervision. (App. Ex. C, letters, various dates)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances responsibly to meet his financial \nobligations. The delinquent debts listed in credit reports for Applicant are a security \nconcern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 AG 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant incurred delinquent debt while on active duty, \nand after moving and being unable to find good-paying employment. He also incurred \ndebts from his first marriage that he was unable to pay. Applicant has paid some of his \ndebts but some still remain unpaid. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions partially apply. The largest debt, \nthe judgment from the automobile accident, happened while Applicant was on active \nduty. Most of the remaining debts were incurred after Applicant left active duty and \nmoved to a new location. The accident was not beyond his control since he was at fault \nand he was driving the car without knowing if it was properly insured. Most of his other \ndebts were the result of his inability to find good employment when he left active duty \nand moved. Some other debts were incurred by his former wife without his knowledge. \nUnder the circumstances, Applicant acted responsibly. He found work, even though it \nwas not at the rate of pay he formerly made, paid bills as he could, lived within his \nmeans, and did not incur any additional delinquent debt. He paid as many of the debts \nas his finances permitted.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. The \nconcept of good-faith action requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Applicant took \naction to pay the debts he could based on the limit of his financial resources. Applicant \nfully paid eight of his debts. He actively disputes six more debts and has plausible \nreasons for the disputes. He tried to determine the reasons for and the creditors of three \nother debts but does not have sufficient information to determine the nature of the debt \nand the creditor. He has not paid twelve of the debts because he does not at this time \nhave the financial resources to pay them. He made a token payment on his largest debt, \nthe accident judgment. The actions to pay his debts that he has taken show a good-faith \neffort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumentation to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue). Applicant disputes six of his delinquent debts. Three \ndisputes (SOR 1.e, 1.h, and 1.w) have been resolved in his favor. Three others (SOR \n1.j, 1.v, and 1dd) still have to be resolved. Applicant did not present documentation of \nhis dispute on these three debts, but based on the information provided by Applicant, it \nappears he has a reasonable basis for his disputes.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant served over \n\n \n9 \n \n \nten year of active and reserve military duty. He held a high level security clearance \nwithout issue while on active duty. He was rewarded and commended for his military \nservice. I considered the Applicant provides voluntary services in his church and \ncommunity and has a reputation for honest, integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. The issue is not simply \nwhether all of Applicant's debts are paid. It is whether his financial circumstances raise \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant has established a \nmeaningful track record by paying eight of his debts and disputing another six. Still of \nconcern are the debts he cannot pay because he does not have the financial resources \nto pay them. The debts were incurred because of an automobile accident, his move to a \nnew location, and his inability to find good paying meaningful employment to pay his \nbills. He worked at jobs he could find while seeking better employment. He is now living \nwithin his means and not incurring any additional delinquent debt. Applicant intends to \ncontinue to pay his debts as resources become available. It is doubtful he will have \nsufficient income to ever repay the automobile accident judgment. His inability to \ncompletely pay his delinquent debts is countered by the fact he successfully held a top \nlevel security clearance for over eight years while on active duty. Applicant established \nthat he acted reasonably and responsibly towards his finances. His actions indicate he \nwill act reasonably and responsibly to protect classified information. The management \nof his finances indicates he will be concerned, responsible, and not careless concerning \nclassified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.dd:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April\n27, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\n\nThe Judge made formal findings favorable to Applicant under Guideline E.  Those findings are not challenged\n1\non appeal.\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   For the following reasons, the Board\n1\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant\nbegan consuming alcohol regularly by age 13.  During his active duty tour in the military, he\ndeveloped serious alcohol and drug abuse problems.  In 1985 he was charged with drunk driving and\npunished under the UCMJ.  Applicant managed to successfully conclude his military career despite\nhis substance abuse problems.  Following his discharge from active duty in 1989, Applicant\ncontinued to abuse alcohol on a regular basis.  Because of his drinking, he encountered considerable\ndifficulties in his marriage and in holding jobs.  Besides alcohol, Applicant abused drugs (marijuana\nand cocaine) over a period of many years, including the years of his military service.  Applicant\nadmitted himself to a 28-day substance abuse program in 2000.  It is not clear from the record what\nthe program entailed or how Applicant progressed in the program.  \nIn March 2008, Applicant enrolled in a VA-sponsored inpatient First Step program.  Upon\nadmission, he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, cocaine dependence and cannabis abuse.\nApplicant experienced problems with the program regimen and, after participating for just over a\nmonth, was discharged from the program prior to completion due to aggressive behavior and an\naltercation with another patient.  There was no change in his diagnosis.  Since his discharge,\nApplicant has maintained abstinence from alcohol and drugs and is committed to a lifestyle of\npermanent abstinence.  He is participating in VA aftercare groups.  Applicant has not consumed\nalcohol since February 2008.\nThe Judge concluded: Applicant\u2019s recurrent problems with abusive and addictive drinking\nraise major concerns over his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  Whether Applicant can safely avert\nrecurrent drinking cannot be firmly established without an updated professional evaluation by a\ncredentialed physician or licensed substance abuse counselor.  Although Applicant has been able to\navoid any more alcohol-related arrests since his last arrest and conviction in 1985, his past excessive\nalcohol consumption was frequent, extreme, and recurrent over long periods of time.  Without proof\nof a longer period of sustained abstinence, application of mitigating conditions is precluded.  Based\non a whole-person assessment, Applicant fails to make a sufficiently convincing showing that he has\na sufficient period of sustained abstinence, considering his lengthy history of recurrent alcohol abuse.\nApplicant\u2019s mitigation efforts, while considerable, are not enough to overcome risks of potential\nrelapse, given his recurrent abuse and addictive history.  Regarding Applicant\u2019s drug abuse, at this\ntime there is insufficient credible seasoning of Applicant\u2019s mitigating efforts to avert foreseeable\nrisks of recurrent cocaine and marijuana use.\nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to consider or comment on his clearly demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, as indicated by disassociation from drug users and\ncontacts, avoiding the environment where drugs are used, and his signing of a statement of intent not\nto use with automatic revocation of his clearance for any violation.  Applicant asserts that the Judge\n\nerred by not informing him that he could submit the letter of intent.  Applicant states that the record\nevidence indicates that the alcohol and drug abuse concerns should have been mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nPortions of Applicant\u2019s argument are based on the content of documents that were submitted\nwith his appeal brief.  These documents were not part of the record below.  The documents submitted\nincluded an undated statement from Applicant indicating his intent not to use drugs or alcohol in the\nfuture and agreeing to an automatic revocation of his clearance in the future if he engages in\nsubstance abuse.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  \nApplicant asserts that the Judge erred by not informing him that he could have submitted the\nsigned statement of intent.  Applicant received a copy of the Directive prior to the hearing in his\ncase.  The Directive\u2019s adjudicative guidelines state that such a letter of intent may be mitigating.\nDirective, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 26(b)(4).  In DOHA proceedings, the parties are responsible for preparing\nand presenting their own cases.  The Judge is responsible for adjudicating the case based on the\nrecord.  The Judge was not obligated to advise the parties of specific steps that might advance their\ncase (such as submission of a letter of intent).  Applicant has not demonstrated error on the part of\nthe Judge.\nApplicant states that the Judge did not consider certain evidence (cited in a previous\nparagraph) relative to mitigation.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge has considered\nall the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).\nApplicant has failed to overcome this presumption.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that 22 months of sobriety without a\nrecurrence is an insufficient amount of time to mitigate the case is arbitrary, capricious, and not\nsupported by the evidence.  He also asserts that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that another year of\nabstinence is needed to provide sufficient assurances that he will not relapse is unreasonable.  After\na review of the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s conclusion, in light of this record, that\n22 months of sobriety is insufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns is sustainable.\nThe Judge\u2019s comment that an additional year of sobriety is needed to provide \u201csufficient assurance\u201d\nthat Applicant will not relapse is more problematic.  The Judge\u2019s comment concerning an additional\nyear of sobriety may simply be an acknowledgment that, once an Applicant\u2019s clearance is denied,\nhe is precluded from reapplying for a clearance for one year.  Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.37.\nHowever, to the extent that the Judge\u2019s comment about an additional year of sobriety constitutes a\nrecommendation for a future grant of a clearance to Applicant, it has no binding effect upon the\ngovernment inasmuch as it is based on presumed future conduct that is not before the Judge and\ncannot be a component of his current security clearance decision.  Indeed, the Judge acknowledges\nthat he does not have the authority to commit the government to approval of a clearance for\nApplicant at some identifiable future date.  Given this, the Board is unclear as to what purpose the\nJudge\u2019s recommendation serves, and it is out of place.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of the mitigating factors listed under\nGuidelines F and G and indicated in some detail why some mitigating conditions did not apply and\nwhy others only partially applied and why those partial applications did not ultimately mitigate the\nsubstance abuse concerns raised in the case.  Reading the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge had sufficient bases to conclude that Applicant\u2019s long history of recurrent\nperiods of both alcohol and drug abuse were of such gravity that they outweighed the more recent\nefforts Applicant has made to abstain from substance abuse and change his lifestyle.  The Judge also\nappropriately expressed a concern that the last regimen of inpatient treatment for Applicant ended\nwith an involuntary withdrawal from the program short of the completion date.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs), effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 17, 2009, and requested a decision \non the record.  At the government\u2019s request, the case was converted to a hearing.  The \ncase was assigned to me on September 11, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on \nOctober 8, 2009.  A hearing was convened on the scheduled date, and for good cause \nshown was continued (Tr. 9-11).  The case was rescheduled for hearing on December \nApril 27, 2010\n\n10, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the government's \ncase consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and seven \nexhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 22, 2009.  Based upon a review \nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues and Rulings \n \nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend \nsubparagraph 1.a of the SOR to substitute the date of 1982 for 1972 and subparagraph \n2.a to change the date of 1977 to 1980.  For good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion requests were granted.  Applicant admitted the allegations as amended. \n \nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the \nrecord with chips commemorating 18 months of sobriety.  For good cause shown, \nApplicant was afforded seven days to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, \nApplicant documented his receipt of chips commemorating 18 months of sobriety.  \nApplicant\u2019s submission was admitted for consideration as exhibit H. \n \n \n \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \nUnder Guideline G, the Government alleged that Applicant: (a) consumed alcohol \nto excess and to the point of intoxication between 1972 (amended to 1982) and February \n2008; (b) was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in \n1985 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and awarded 25 days of \ncorrectional study and reduction in rank; (c) participated in a substance abuse treatment  \nand detoxification program operated by a charitable organization (S Services) in 1997; \n(d) participated in a 28-day outpatient substance abuse program in 2000; (e) participated \nin a substance abuse first step program (sponsored by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (DVA)) between March 2008 and April 2008, where he was diagnosed with \nalcohol dependence and cannabis abuse; and (f) experienced negative affects in his \nmarriage and loss of jobs attributable to his abuse of alcohol. \n \nUnder Guideline H, the Government alleged that Applicant: (a) used and \npurchased marijuana and cocaine on multiple occasions between 1977 (amended to \n1980) and February 2008; (b) was diagnosed with cocaine dependence in 2008; (c) used \nmarijuana frequently while in the U.S. Marine Corps (between 1983 and 1989), (d) tested \npositive for marijuana in 1986 and 2006, respectively; (e) was diagnosed with cocaine \ndependence and cannabis abuse; (f) was charged with marijuana possession in August \n1994 (dismissed) and November 2006; (g) was treated for substance abuse in 1997 and \n2000, respectively; and (h) used marijuana on multiple occasions while possessing a \nDoD security clearance and serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant falsified his security \nclearance application (e-QIP) in August 2008 by (a) omitting his drug-related arrests in \n1994 and 2006 and (b) understating his marijuana use. \n \n2\n\n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, except for \nthe date corrections he cited.  He added explanations. \n \n       \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is 44-year-old security professional for a defense contractor who seeks \na security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow. \n \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children.  After high school, he enlisted in the \nMarine Corps and served for four years of active duty (between 1983 and 1987) and two \nyears in the active reserves (see ex. 1; Tr. 48-49).  During his active service, he was \nassigned to an air and naval gunfire company and belonged to a rapid deployable \nforward operating airborne unit (Tr. 49-50). He received his honorable discharge in 1989 \n(Tr. 51). \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and drug history \n \nAt a very early age, Applicant was introduced to alcohol.  By the time he was 13, \nhe was consuming a six-pack of beer a week in social situations. While in high school, \nhe regularly consumed alcohol at abusive levels on a virtually daily basis (see ex. 4).  He \ngraduated from high school in 1981, and soon enlisted in the Marine Corps. (see exs. 1 \nand 3; Tr. 62). \n \nDuring his active duty tour in the Marine Corps, Applicant developed serious \nalcohol and drug abuse problems.  His medical records reveal he consumed alcohol \nregularly when not on duty (see ex. 4).  In 1985, he was charged with drunk driving \nunder the UCMJ, and was awarded article 15 punishment and sentenced to 25 days in \ncorrectional study, and reduced in rank (see exs. 3 through 5).  Despite his alcohol and \ndrug problems during his active military tour of duty, Applicant continued to function at \nacceptable levels and received numerous awards and commendations recognizing his \ncontributions to his command. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing his discharge from active military service in September 1989 (see ex. \nC), Applicant continued to abuse alcohol on a regular basis.  Between 1982 and \nFebruary 2009, he abused alcohol daily, both on the job and at home (ex. 4).  In 1997, \nhe turned to a recognized charitable organization (S Services) for guidance in controlling \nhis drinking.  Records document that he participated in an outpatient substance abuse \nprogram operated by HL. He completed this program and was able to remain sober for \nthe duration of the program and for about six months thereafter (see ex. 4; Tr. 56-57), \nbefore returning to abusive drinking. Because of his drinking, Applicant encountered \nconsiderable difficulties in his marriage and in holding jobs.  His continued drinking also \ncontributed to serious strains in his relationships with his father and siblings (see ex. 4). \n \n \n3\n\nApplicant admitted himself to a 28-day substance abuse program offered by a \nrecognized substance abuse facility in 2000 (Tr. 58).  It is not clear from the record what \nthis program entailed and how Applicant progressed in the program.  \n \nBesides alcohol, Applicant abused drugs over a period of many years.  He was \nintroduced to marijuana when he was about 14 years of age (ex. 3).  He continued using \nit on a recurrent basis between 1980 and February 2008 (exs. 3 and 4). Typically, he \nsmoked marijuana with friends and used the drug throughout his active duty military tour.  \nHis frequent use of marijuana in the Marine Corps contributed to six reductions in rank \nand several forfeitures of pay (see ex. 4).  Records document that he used marijuana \ncontinuously between November 1983 and December 1989 while in the Marine Corps. \nand holding a security clearance (see exs. 3 and 5; Tr. 66-67).  Applicant freely \nacknowledges that his use of illegal drugs violated DoD\u2019s drug policy (Tr. 67). Records \nreflect that he tested positive for marijuana in 1986, and again in 2006 (see ex. 3; Tr. 47). \n \n \n \nIn 1989, Applicant was introduced to cocaine.  Between 1989 and December \n2008, he used cocaine with varying frequency.  Except for an extended period of non- \nuse between 1996 and 2000, he used cocaine regularly between 1980 and February \n2008, a period of almost 28 years (exs. 3 and 5; Tr. 63).  \n \nOver the course of his use of both drugs (marijuana and cocaine), Applicant \noccasionally purchased small quantities of both drugs for his personal use and sharing \nwith friends (Tr. 64).  However, he never purchased nor sold drugs for the purpose of \nproducing a profit.  Twice, he was arrested and charged with possession of illegal drugs: \nonce in August 1994 (charge later dismissed) and again in November 2006 (dismissed) \n(see exs. 3 and 5; Tr. 45-47). \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant enrolled in a VA-sponsored First Step program. This \nwas an inpatient program designed to treat admitted patients for substance abuse (both \ndrugs and alcohol) over the course of the 90 days allotted to the program (see exs. 3 and \n4; Tr. 59-60).  Upon admission, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, \ncocaine dependence, and cannabis abuse. His provider-designed treatment regimen \nincluded daily sessions of milieu therapy (including community meetings), group therapy, \npsycho-educational classes (e.g., relapsed prevention, 12-steps, communication, and \ncognitive coping), recreational therapy, and individual drug and alcohol counseling.  His \nhospital report reveals he encountered First Step problems in his associations with his \nFirst Step peers (ex. 4).  His records note that he sometimes left the organized group \nsetting to isolate with a female member of the group.   \n \nAfter spending just a little over a month in the VA program, Applicant was \ndischarged from the program, as the result of reported verbal altercations with one of his \npeers in the program (see ex. 5; Tr. 59-60). Notwithstanding the objectionable behavior \nof the other patient in the cited exchange, Applicant was determined by the VA\u2019s hospital \nstaff to be the most culpable party and was discharged from the program prior to \ncompletion due to aggressive behavior and the altercation with another patient of the \ncommunity (ex. 4).  \n \n4\n\n \nPrior to his discharge from the VA\u2019s First Step program, Applicant was advised to \nmaintain his abstinence from alcohol and drugs after his discharge, attend a local \nhousing shelter, attend aftercare meetings, attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nsponsored 12-step meetings and other peer-oriented support groups in the community, \nand continue to work with Next Step groups seeking employment and vocational \nassistance (ex. 4). He was discharged in April 2008 with no reported change in his \ndiagnoses. \n \nSince his discharge from the VA\u2019s First Step program, Applicant has maintained \nhis abstinence from alcohol and drugs and is committed to a lifestyle of permanent \nabstinence (ex. 4). Applicant\u2019s substance abuse coordinator with the VA First Step \nprogram he was involved with in 2008 credited him with making an excellent transition \nfrom the VA\u2019s program to the clean and sober transitional housing system it operates on \ncampus (see ex. F).  This VA coordinator stressed Applicant\u2019s continued participation in \nVA aftercare groups and individual case management, his regular attendance at 12-Step \nmeetings with the aid of his sponsor, his local church affiliation, and his service as a \nsource of support and inspiration for his fellow Veterans (ex. F; Tr. 81-82).  Applicant \nassures he has not consumed any alcohol since February 2008, and provides chips that \ncommemorate his sobriety since February 2008 (a period of almost 22 months) with the \nsupport of his recovery programs (see ex. H; Tr. 80-82). Applicant\u2019s assurances of \nsustained sobriety since February 2008 (Tr. 54-55) are credible ones and are accepted. \n \nOther VA staff members who are familiar with Applicant\u2019s progress since his \ndischarge from the VA\u2019s First Step program vouchsafe for his commitment to sober \nliving, involvement with outpatient therapy groups, and regular meetings with his AA \nsponsor (see ex. F).  They make optimistic assessments of his ability to stay sober in the \nforeseeable future.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions and understatements \n \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in August 2008, Applicant omitted his drug-related \narrests in 1985 and 2006, and understated his use of marijuana and cocaine (see ex.1). \nHe attributed his omissions and understated drug use to misunderstanding how much \nbackground information the e-QIP questions were intended to elicit (Tr. 70).  When \ninterviewed by an OPM agent in November 2008, he voluntarily disclosed his arrests and \nmore extensive drug use without any prompting from the agent (see ex. 3; Tr. 45, 70-71). \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of misunderstanding and confusion are not very \nconvincing.  He impresses as a very intelligent and experienced ex-Marine who was \nclearly embarrassed over his transgressions with alcohol and drugs and determined to \nlimit as much adverse information about his abuse of alcohol and drugs as he could \nplausibly achieve without exposing himself to detection.  \n \nTo his credit, Applicant was completely honest and forthcoming about his alcohol \nand drug abuse with his military and VA providers who treated his extensive alcohol and \n \n5\n\ndrug addictions in March and April 2008.  And when he appeared for a scheduled OPM \ninterview in August 2008, he promptly disclosed all of his drug-related arrest history and \ninvolvement with drugs without any prompting by the interviewing OPM agent.  \nApplicant\u2019s credible corrections are accepted upon consideration of all of the facts and \ncircumstances. \n \nEndorsements \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor and work colleagues, aware of his continuing \nparticipation in recovery programs (Tr. 74-82), describe Applicant as professional in \nevery way in carrying out his responsibilities and an outstanding employee (see ex. G).  \nHis plant manager and direct supervisors describe Applicant\u2019s job performance under \nstressful conditions as exceptional and credit him with dependable and reliable \nperformance on a consistent basis (ex. G). Applicant\u2019s military and employment credits \ninclude numerous training certificates and team awards (see exs. D, E, and G; Tr. 51-52, \n68-69).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father explained Applicant\u2019s reasons for enlisting in the Marine Corps \nfollowing his high school graduation and described Applicant\u2019s continued devotion to the \nUnited States (see ex. B). A former teacher characterized Applicant as honorable, \nhonest, prudent, and possessed of good morals (ex. B).  She credits him with turning his \nlife completely around and attending AA meetings regularly (ex. B).  Other family \nmembers extol his Marine service, his sobriety commitments, and his active and healthy \nlifestyle (ex. B).   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations \nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered \nbefore deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or \ndenied.  However, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision.  \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk.  \n \n6\n\n \n7\n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the \nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nSee AG \u00b6 21. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription \ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBurden of Proof \n \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \n\n \n8\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 (1988).  As with all \nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a \nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot \ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \n \nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the \nfacts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a \nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, \n531 (1988).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nApplicant is a highly regarded employee of a defense contractor with a history of \nrecurrent abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs over 30 years. Applicant\u2019s exhibited alcohol \nand drug abuse raise security concerns covered by Guidelines G and H of the AGs.  \nApplicant\u2019s omissions create initial concerns about his trustworthiness and reliability \nunder Guideline E. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol issues \n \nApplicant\u2019s recurrent problems with abusive and addictive drinking raise major \nconcerns over his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  On the strength of the evidence \npresented, two disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol \nconsumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from \nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis \nby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or \npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d \u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d \n \n\n \n9\nHistorically, Applicant has experienced serious and recurrent problems with \nabusive and addictive drinking.  His difficulties include an award of Article 15 punishment \nduring his active tour duty in the Marine Corps for a DUI offense, and several treatment \nepisodes to address his alcohol dependence issues.   \n \nWhether Applicant can safely avert recurrent drinking cannot be firmly \nestablished without an updated professional evaluation by a credentialed physician or \nlicensed substance abuse counselor. His recent participation in a VA First-Step program \nwas encouraging but abbreviated by his necessitated early discharge from the program \ndue to behavior issues. To his credit, Applicant has continued to abide by the \nabstinence principles he absorbed during his stay with the VA-First Step program and \nhas utilized a combination of VA and community resources to further solidify his sobriety \nand promote his recovery and progress as a valued member of his community. The \nupdated assessment he provided from his clinical services coordinator with the VA and \ndocumented chips commemorating his 18 months of sustained sobriety strengthens his \nprospects for maintaining his alcohol-free commitments.  \n \nDocumented support of Applicant\u2019s sustained sobriety over the past 18 months \nis, of course, an important consideration in determining what weight to assign to his  \nrehabilitation claims.  See ISCR Case 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006); ISCR Case \n01-20579, at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004).   While his sobriety efforts certainly improve his \nchances for staying alcohol-free, with his recurrent history of alcohol abuse and \ndiagnosed dependence, it is still too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant is at \nno foreseeable risk to relapse. DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has consistently stressed the \nimportance of a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption in serious \ncases that involve extensive alcohol use and diagnosed dependence.  See ISCR Cae \nNo. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. \nBd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007). \n \nHere, although Applicant has been able to avoid any more alcohol-related arrests \nsince his last arrest and conviction in 1985, his past excessive alcohol consumption was \nfrequent, extreme, and recurrent over long periods of time. His relatively recent \nconversion to sobriety under the circumstances (almost 22 months) precludes any more \nthan partial application of MC \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nWithout proof of a longer period of sustained abstinence (almost 22 months \nhere), none of the other potentially available mitigating conditions under the alcohol \nguideline are available to Applicant.  Passage of time without a recurrent incident, and \nrenewed commitments to sobriety, while certainly important, are not enough to warrant \napplication of any of the other mitigating conditions without any demonstrated \nsatisfaction of the requirements imposed by these other mitigating conditions.  \n \nFaced with similar evidence of recurrent alcohol abuse over a considerable \nperiod of time, and the absence of any lengthy abstinence observance, DOHA\u2019s Appeal \nBoard has expressed reluctance to make safe, predictive judgments about an \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \napplicant\u2019s ability to avoid abusive incidents in the future without strong probative \nevidence of sustained recovery, aided by positive professional reinforcements, DOHA\u2019s \nAppeal Board has expressed reluctance to make safe, predictive judgments about an \napplicant\u2019s ability to avoid abusive incidents in the future.  See cases, supra.  Another \nyear of abstinence is needed by Applicant to provide sufficient assurances he will not \nrelapse. \n \nTaking into account both Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his strong work \nrecord, the applicable guidelines and a whole person assessment of his most recent \nalcohol moderation efforts, conclusions warrant that his overall efforts, while \nencouraging, do not reflect sufficient evidence of sustained commitment to a program \nthat provides optimum protections against recurrent alcohol abuse.  In the past, he has \nenjoyed considerable periods of abuse avoidance, only to return to abusive drinking that \ninvolved alcohol-related incidents away from work. Because of this recurrent abuse \nproblem, his earlier incidents and treatment history cannot be considered sufficiently \nbehind him to afford reliable assurances he will not again relapse in the foreseeable \nfuture.   \n \nBased on a whole-person assessment, Applicant fails to make a sufficiently \nconvincing showing that he has a sufficient period of sustained abstinence, considering \nhis lengthy history of recurrent alcohol abuse (with diagnosed dependence) to avert any \nrecurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol. His contributions to the \nMarine Corps and other participants in the VA\u2019s First Step program are notable and \nworthy of praise. Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts, while considerable, are not enough, \nhowever, to overcome risks of potential relapse, given his recurrent abuse and addictive \nhistory. Some additional time in sustained abstinence (at least a year) is needed to \nfacilitate safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated \nwith alcohol abuse. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations \ncovered by the alcohol guideline of the SOR.  \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug concerns \n \nOver a 27-year period (between 1980 and February 2008), Applicant used and \npurchased marijuana and cocaine intermittently in social situations and tested positive \nfor marijuana use during his active duty tour with the Marine Corps (in 1986), and again \nin 2006.  His active involvement with illegal drugs includes arrests in 1994 and 2006 for \nmarijuana possession.  Use and purchase of illegal drugs, (inclusive of marijuana and \ncocaine) are proscribed by both state law and federal law (see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802, et seq.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of his marijuana-related arrests, his use and purchases of  \nmarijuana and cocaine over recurrent periods, his testing positive for marijuana while \nserving in the U.S. Marine Corps, and his diagnosed cocaine dependence raise both \njudgment concerns and security concerns over risks of recurrence. On the strength of \nthe evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions of the AGs for drug abuse are \napplicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d DC \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug \nuse,\u201d DC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d DC \u00b6 25(d), \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, \nor psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence;\u201d DC \u00b6 25(f), \u201cfailure to successfully a \ndrug treatment program prescribed by a duly qualified medical professional,\u201d and DC \u00b6 \n25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d \n \nBased on his own creditable testimony, the testimonials of Applicant\u2019s character \nreferences, and his demonstrated abstinence over an appreciable period of time, \nApplicant is entitled to take some advantage of two of the mitigating conditions of MC \u00b6 \n26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 26(b)(2), \n\u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used,\u201d to the merits of his \nsituation.  In fairness to Applicant, he has exhibited candor about his past marijuana and \ncocaine use and his associations with persons who have used the substances.  \n \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established independent \nprobative evidence of his overall reliability and trustworthiness with his employer and \ncommunity sponsors and understanding of DoD policy constraints on the use of illegal \nsubstances.  His positive endorsements from his colleagues who are familiar with his \npast marijuana involvement reinforce his discontinuance assurances.  Whole-person \nassessments, however, are still insufficient to enable Applicant to surmount the \njudgment questions raised by his recurrent use of illegal drugs over a prolonged period \n(some while holding a security clearance) and diagnosed addiction to cocaine.  Despite \nhis credible abstinence efforts over the past 22 months and his strong character \nreferences from friends and colleagues who know him, it is still too soon to make safe \npredictions about his ability to avert any recurrence risks. Lingering doubts remain \nconcerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Some additional \ntime in sustained abstinence (a year or more) is needed to provide sufficient assurance \nthat he will not return to illegal drug use. 1 \n  \n \n \nConsidering the record on a whole, at this time there is insufficient credible \nseasoning of Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts (almost 22 months of sustained abstinence) \nto avert foreseeable risks of recurrent cocaine and marijuana use. Taking into account \nall of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug use and purchases, his \ndrug-related arrests, his positive drug tests, and his judgment lapses associated with his \nuse of marijuana while holding a security clearance in the U.S. Marine Corps. Applicant \nfails to mitigate security concerns under Guideline H.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant \nwith respect to the allegations covered by Guidelines H, as they pertain to his drug \ninvolvement. \n \n \n1Any recommendation to approve Applicant\u2019s clearance in the future, of course,  is not binding on \nthe Government. If Applicant\u2019s company sponsors him for a clearance one year after the date of this \nclearance, approval of a clearance at that time will be based on all the facts and circumstances at that \npoint in time. An administrative judge does not have authority to commit the government to approval of a \nclearance at some future date. See generally ISCR Case No. 08-07540 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2010); \nISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, \u201cThe Board has no authority to grant \n[a]pplicant a conditional or probationary security clearance to allow [him or] her the opportunity to have a \nsecurity clearance decision while [he or she] works on [his or] her financial problems.\u201d and citing ISCR \nCase No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)).   \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nPersonal conduct concerns \n \nSecurity concerns over Appellant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are \nraised under Guideline E as well as the result of his omissions of his two drug-related \narrests and his understatement of his drug use.  By omitting his recurrent drug use and \npast experiments in marijuana cultivation, Applicant failed to furnish materially important \nbackground information about his drug use that was needed for the government to \nproperly process and evaluate his security clearance application.  DC \u00b6 16(a) of the \npersonnel conduct guideline, \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d is fully applicable to the facts of Applicant\u2019s situation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s omissions are not excusable and cannot plausibly be attributable to \nmisunderstanding and confusion over the scope of the questions presented in his e-\nQIP. His full and voluntary disclosures to the OPM agent who interviewed him three \nmonths later enable him, however, to take advantage of one of the mitigating conditions \nof the personnel conduct guideline: MC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d   \n \nTaking into account all of the evidence produced in this record, Applicant may be \ncredited with mitigating trust and reliability concerns associated with his e-QIP \nomissions and understatements.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the \nGuideline E allegations that Applicant knowingly and wilfully (a) omitted his two drug-\nrelated arrests and (b) understated the extent of his use of marijuana and cocaine.  \n \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including \neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs. \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, \nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate \nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparas. 1.a through 1.f:                 \n     \n    Against Applicant  \n \nGUIDELINE H: (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):              AGAINST APPLICANT  \n    \n Subparas. 2.a through 2.m: \n \n \n    Against  Applicant \n \nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):             FOR APPLICANT \n    \n  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n Subparas. 3.a and 3.b: \n \n \n     \n For  Applicant \n \n Conclusions \n \n  \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admits the factual allegations in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 51-year-old software design engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since September 2001, and is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance. In August 1996, Applicant obtained a secret security clearance. (Item 5, page 6 of 10) In November 2005, he was granted a top secret security clearance. (Item 9) In July 2005, Applicant was interviewed concerning his marijuana usage. (Item 6) Applicant used marijuana from 1980 to 1984 and 1988 to 1990. He used marijuana two or three times a week, spending $50 per month for marijuana. (Item 6) In January 1983, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. He was fined.

In August 1996, Applicant had obtained a secret security clearance. In \nNovember 2005, he obtained a top secret security clearance. Applicant has failed to \nrebut or mitigate drug involvement and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nDecember 18, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 9, 2009, detailing security concerns under drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct. \n \n \nOn August 7, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated September 9, 2009. The FORM contained nine \nattachments described as \u201cItems.\u201d On September 23, 2009, Applicant received a copy \nof the FORM, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nResponses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on November 25, 2009. As of December 2, 2009, no response had \nbeen received. On December 7, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admits the factual allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old software design engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since September 2001, and is seeking to maintain a secret security \nclearance. In August 1996, Applicant obtained a secret security clearance. (Item 5, \npage 6 of 10) In November 2005, he was granted a top secret security clearance. (Item \n9) \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant was interviewed concerning his marijuana usage. (Item 6) \nApplicant used marijuana from 1980 to 1984 and 1988 to 1990. He used marijuana two \nor three times a week, spending $50 per month for marijuana. (Item 6) In January 1983, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. He was fined. \nApplicant reported this offense on his Security Clearance Application, Standard Form \n(SF) 86. (Item 5) He did not use marijuana from 1984 to 1988 because it was not \navailable. In 1990, he voluntarily attended counseling concerning his marijuana use. He \nattended counseling once a week for approximately a year and a half. As of July 2005, \nApplicant had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant suffered from anxiety and a lack of sleep. From 1999 to 2002, he was \nprescribed Prozac. In August 2007, when he thought his medication was not working as \nit should, he decided to \u201cself-medicate\u201d with marijuana. (Item 6) His medication was \nchanged from Prozac to Paxil. Applicant used marijuana from August 2007 to \nSeptember 2008. Applicant obtained marijuana from his nephew and used it twice a \nweek. The marijuana helped him to sleep. In May 2008, he stopped smoking marijuana. \n(Item 6)  \n \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant self-reported his marijuana usage and sought help from \nhis company\u2019s employee assistance program to refrain from using marijuana and to \nresolve his anxiety. (Item 6) From June 2008 through November 2008, he was treated \nby a licensed clinical social worker for a condition diagnosed, in part, as cannabis \nabuse. (Item 8) Applicant asserts he last used marijuana in September 2008, three \nmonths after he began counseling. (Item 4)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to \ndrug involvement in that the use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse \nor drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who, is a staff member of a \nrecognized drug treatment program; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program \nprescribed by a duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1980 to 1984, 1988 to 1990, and August 2007 to \nSeptember 2008. In 1983, he was arrested, charged, and fined for possession of \nmarijuana. His arrest and fine did not stop his marijuana usage. It was not until 1984 \nthat he first stopped using marijuana and that period of non-use lasted only four years. \nIn 1996, Applicant had obtained a secret clearance, and in 2005, he obtained a top \nsecret clearance. Even with a clearance, Applicant used marijuana. In June 2008, he \nwas diagnosed with cannabis abuse. AG \u00b6 25(a) drug abuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) possessing \nand purchasing illegal drugs, AG \u00b6 25(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence \nby a licensed clinical social worker, and AG \u00b6 25(g) any illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance, apply.  \n \nIn 1990, Applicant received counseling for his marijuana use and again from \nJune 2008 through November 2008, Applicant received treatment. I do not find \nApplicant\u2019s seeking treatment to be a disqualifying condition. I find for him as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1(d) and 1 (e). \n \nAG \u00b6 26 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, \nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the \nfuture, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs \nwere used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or \nprolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed, \nand abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nNone of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns apply. AG \u00b6 26(a) \ndoes not apply because Applicant use was frequent and recent. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not \napply. Applicant asserts he will no longer use marijuana. Because Applicant chose to \nhave this matter handled administratively, I am unable to: test the veracity of his \nassertions; to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or to form a positive determination \nas to his truthfulness;  to find Applicant was sincere, open, and honest. Applicant last \nused marijuana in September 2008, slightly more than one year ago. This period of \nabstinence is insufficient to insure Applicant will not return to using marijuana. \nAdditionally, Applicant had abstained from marijuana usage for 17 years before using \nmarijuana again. Applicant has not signed any statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply because prescription drugs were not abused. AG \u00b6 \n26(d) does not apply because there is no favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse after being granted a clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.b), the pertinent disqualifying condition is \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations. Marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance violated important civil and criminal rules in our society, and a history of such \nproblems is conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s \nprofessional and community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply because \nomission, concealment, or falsification was not alleged. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply \nbecause there was no allegation of refusing or failing to cooperate with the security \nclearance  process. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because Applicant used marijuana after \nhaving obtained a clearance and that use occurred slightly more than one year ago. \nApplicant used marijuana to self-medicate his problem with anxiety. His marijuana use \nwas not infrequent nor did it happen under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur or does not cast doubt on the his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant self-reported his marijuana usage and sought help from his company\u2019s \nemployee assistance program to help him refrain from using marijuana and to resolve \nhis anxiety. AG \u00b6 17(d) partially applies. Applicant has expressed his desire to refrain \nfrom marijuana use and sought counseling. In 1990, Applicant received counseling and \nhad no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. However, he returned to marijuana \nusage.  He again received counseling and again intends to refrain from using marijuana. \n \nIn AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d does not apply to Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use after being granted a clearance. There is no showing Applicant has taken \npositive steps to eliminating any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. \nAny personal conduct security concerns pertaining to his marijuana use after being \ngranted a clearance is dealt with more thoroughly under the specific, pertinent \nguidelines. For example, drug use is best addressed under the drug involvement \nguideline in this decision.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am \nunable to find Applicant has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply because the information \nwas substantiated. AG \u00b6 17(g) does not apply. There is no showing Applicant has \nceased his involvement with persons involved in criminal activity. The only alleged \nperson involved in criminal contact was Applicant\u2019s nephew from which Applicant \npurchased his marijuana. Applicant\u2019s current contact with is nephew is unknown. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant used marijuana \nperiodically. He used it after being arrested for possession and after periods where he \nabstained or refrained from using it for years. His use occurred over a 27-year period. \nFrom 1980 until 1994, Applicant used marijuana, then abstained from using it for four \nyears before using again. He used marijuana again for two years before a 17-year \nperiod where he abstained or refrained from its use. In August 2007, he again started \nusing marijuana. His only explanation for using marijuana was that he suffered from \nanxiety and his medication was not working.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs is serious and recent. He did not satisfactorily \nexplain why he returned to marijuana use after such a long absence or why he used \nmarijuana after having obtained his security clearance. I am unable to find that illegal \ndrugs are no longer a part of his life. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his illegal drug usage and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

On October 30, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 16, 2009. Applicant \nrequested her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn March 19, 2010, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written \ncase. In the written case the Government amended Paragraph 1 of the SOR to add two \nAugust 10, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nadditional financial allegations. Those allegations were Subparagraphs 1.e for $100 and \n1.f for $1,140.  \n \n A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the \nApplicant on March 25, 2010, when she received the file. She was given the opportunity \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant \nfiled a Response to the FORM beyond the 30 day time allowed that would have expired \non April 24, 2010. She filed her Response on May 5, 2010. Department Counsel had no \nobjection to the inclusion of the Response in the file. \n \nI received the case assignment on June 2, 2010. Based upon a review of the \ncomplete case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the financial allegations in Paragraph 1 of the SOR, including \nthe two paragraphs added in the SOR amendment. She denied the allegations \nconcerning falsification in Paragraph 2 of the SOR. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and has one child. She was married and divorced twice \nsince 2000. She works for a defense contractor. She was unemployed from January \n2005 to May 2008. During that time she married her second husband and spent \n$50,000 from her retirement account to buy a house. She obtained a second mortgage \non the house and used the proceeds to finance a honeymoon, to defease the debt on \nher husband\u2019s vehicle, to repay Applicant\u2019s credit card debt, and make two or three \nmortgage payments. (Items 4, 5; Response)  \n \nApplicant has six delinquent debts alleged in the SOR as amended, totaling \n$29,132. Those debts and their current status are as follows: \n \n1. A medical account debt for $387 was owed from 2008 \n(Subparagraph 1.a). This debt was unpaid until \nApplicant\u2019s Response showed it was paid in January \n2010. This debt is resolved. (Items 7-9; Response)  \n2. An auto loan debt owed to a credit union. The collection \naccount (Subparagraph 1.b) and the credit union account \n(Subparagraph 1.d) are the same loan under two \ncreditors. This debt was awarded to Applicant\u2019s first \nhusband in their divorce decree. Applicant is not \nresponsible for the debt. This debt is mitigated. (Items 4, \n7-9; Answer) \n3. A credit card debt owed to a bank (Subparagraph 1.c). \nApplicant opened this account on her own in May 1998 \nbefore any of her marriages. Applicant resolved this debt \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nin April 2010 by paying $9,373 borrowed from her father. \n(Items 7-9; Response) \n4. A medical debt for $100 was resolved in November 2009 \nwith the payment of the debt (Subparagraph 1.e). It \noriginated in 2008. The debt is resolved. (Items 7-9; \nResponse) \n5. A medical debt dating from 2008 for $1,140 owed to a \nhospital was paid on April 30, 2010, and is resolved \n(Subparagraph 1.f). (Items 7-9; Response) \n \n \nApplicant had a tax lien filed in May 2006 and released when she paid it in March \n2007. The amount of the individual tax lien was $2,148. Applicant did not disclose in her \nAugust 15, 2008, e-QIP in Question 27 (c) (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien \nplaced against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d) the existence of \nthis lien. She answered that question with a \u201cno.\u201d (Item 5) \n \n \nApplicant did not answer Question 28 on the e-QIP (\u201ca. In the last 7 years, have \nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and b. \u201cAre you currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d) with accurate answers. Her response was \u201cno\u201d to \nboth questions. She did have the debts listed in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s Answer of \nDecember 16, 2009, stated she thought her former husbands were responsible for the \ndebts based on their respective divorce decrees.  \n \n \nShe claims the February 11, 2009, divorce decree from her second husband \nrequires her to pay the $11,000 credit card debt listed in Subparagraph 1.c of the SOR. \nShe was waiting for a March 3, 2010, court date to \u201cresolve\u201d the auto loan debt listed in \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.d of the SOR. The divorce decree from her second husband \ndoes not list the credit card debt as a marital debt, therefore, it is Applicant\u2019s debt from \n1998 which she is responsible to pay. The auto loan debt is allocated to Applicant\u2019s first \nhusband in the divorce decree of July 7, 2005. The other debts in the SOR are not \nmentioned in either divorce decree and are properly debts of Applicant. The 2009 \ndivorce decree stated Applicant and her second husband spent $90,000 of her savings \nin the six months they lived together after their marriage. (Items 4, 5, 7) \n \n \nApplicant submitted three character letters from three supervisors. Those letters \ndescribe her as conscientious and diligent in her work. She is also described as honest \nand professional in her attitude. (FORM Response) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole-person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \nfound in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy; and,   \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nFrom 1998 to the present, Applicant accumulated six delinquent debts, totaling \n$29,132 that remained unpaid or unresolved when the SOR was issued.  \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Three mitigating conditions might have partial \napplicability: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) applies because Applicant\u2019s two marriages and divorces adversely \naffected her ability to pay her debts in a timely manner. The auto loan debt listed twice \nin the SOR was the result of her first husband\u2019s failure to pay the debt. The second \nmarriage dissipated $90,000 of Applicant\u2019s savings in a six month spending spree. \nApplicant was responsible for allowing that to occur, but she did stop the expenditures \nand now has divorced that husband.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d) applies because Applicant has resolved her debts by payment or \nsettlements with required payments. She paid the credit card debt of $11,000 after \nnegotiating a lump sum payment of $9,373. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\n AG \u00b6 20 (e) applies to the auto loan debt because the first divorce allocates that \ndebt to her former husband, making him responsible for it. She has a legal basis to \ndispute that debt listed in the SOR as being her debt.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not disclose her financial delinquencies as alleged in SOR \nParagraph 1. She disclaims any intentional action in doing so. Applicant claims she \nthought her divorce decrees made her former husbands responsible for the debts listed \nin the SOR. Only the auto loan was the financial obligation of her first husband to pay. \nThe other debts listed in the SOR were Applicant\u2019s to pay. It is obvious from the entire \nbody of evidence that Applicant is not astute with her money and did not read fully or \ncomprehend the totality of the divorce decrees. Applicant committed an inadvertent \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nerror, not a deliberate effort to mislead the Government. This guideline is found in her \nfavor. Hence, it is not necessary to consider any mitigating condition.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult when she \nincurred the debts. She was dilatory in resolving her delinquent debts, but after she \nrealized the debts were her obligation she moved quickly to pay them. All the debts \nlisted in the SOR were resolved in some manner. She incurred her debts voluntarily. \nThere is no potential now for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. After two failed \nmarriages and the six month expenditure of $90,000 during the short-lived second \nmarriage, Applicant should have learned her lesson and there is almost no likelihood for \na recurrence of such conduct.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or substantial doubts \nas to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nFinancial Considerations and the security concerns under the guideline for Personal \nConduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraph 1.a to 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S.

    "summary": "findings of fact were in error; whether the Judge failed to consider or mis-weighed record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Finding no harmful error, we affirm. The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a divorced mother of two. She holds a Master of Science degree. Her former husband, an immigrant, was deported to his home country due to criminal activity. He has not provided child support. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, for telephone services, medical bills, etc. Her 1 delinquencies date back to at least 2001. She has not had financial counseling. Although her debt situation has been affected by her divorce and by periods of unemployment, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to demonstrate that circumstances beyond her control fully account for her problems. The Judge noted, for example, that a budget submitted by Applicant indicated that she spent more each month than she takes in, relying on her father for financial assistance. We construe Applicant\u2019s brief as contending that the Judge was biased against her, specifically due to her being a single mother. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is fair and impartial, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.

These debts are no longer in deferment, and Applicant had not made payments for three months as of the\nclose of the record.  They were not alleged in the SOR but are relevant to the issue of mitigation. \n \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 25, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 13, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: Whether the Judge lacked the requisite\nimpartiality; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were in error; whether the Judge failed\nto consider or mis-weighed record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a divorced mother of\ntwo.  She holds a Master of Science degree.  Her former husband, an immigrant, was deported to his\nhome country due to criminal activity.  He has not provided child support.\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts, for telephone services, medical bills, etc.   Her\n1\ndelinquencies date back to at least 2001.  She has not had financial counseling.  Although her debt\nsituation has been affected by her divorce and by periods of unemployment, the Judge concluded that\nApplicant had failed to demonstrate that circumstances beyond her control fully account for her\nproblems.  The Judge noted, for example, that a budget submitted by Applicant indicated that she\nspent more each month than she takes in, relying on her father for financial assistance.  \nWe construe Applicant\u2019s brief as contending that the Judge was biased against her,\nspecifically due to her being a single mother.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is fair\nand impartial, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on\nappeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01306 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).  We have reviewed the\nJudge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole, paying particular attention to the Judge\u2019s conduct\nof the hearing.  We find nothing in the record that would lead a reasonable person to question the\nfairness and impartiality of the Judge.  We resolve this issue adversely to Applicant.\nApplicant also argues that Guideline F is discriminatory against those who are not \u201crich,\nwhite, and well off.\u201d  We have repeatedly noted that our jurisdiction and authority are limited.\nNothing in the Directive gives the Board the jurisdiction or authority to pass judgment on the\nguidance provided to us or to entertain challenges to the wisdom or authority of provisions of the\nDirective.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-10821 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2006); ISCR Case No. 09-\n03724 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2010).  Furthermore, we observe that there is nothing in the plain\n\n3\nlanguage of the Guideline to support Applicant\u2019s contention.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-00951 at\n3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  For example, she challenges the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that she overspends her monthly income by approximately $1,600.  Applicant also challenges\nthe statement quoted above concerning her having been steadily employed for two years.  She asserts\nthat, as a contract employee, there have been periods during the past two years in which she has not\nworked.  Regarding the first challenge, Applicant submitted an exhibit containing budget\ninformation for a single month.  This exhibit reflects expenditures that exceed Applicant\u2019s income,\nthough by a slightly lesser amount than that found by the Judge.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s finding as\nto the specific monetary amount is erroneous.  However, this exhibit does support the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant has failed to demonstrate a reasonable plan to discharge her debts.\nConcerning the second challenge, we have examined Government Exhibit 1, Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application, at 13.  This document states that Applicant has been employed by a\nnamed company since July 2008.  Accordingly, it supports the challenged finding.  The Judge\u2019s error\nconcerning the amount by which Applicant overspent her income is not likely to have affected the\noutcome of the case.  Therefore, it is harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 29, 2009) for definition of harmless error.  The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare supported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) \nIn support of her appeal, Applicant submits new evidence not contained in the record, for\nexample information about debt repayment occurring after the close of the record, which we cannot\nconsider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (No new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal\nBoard).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  Applicant contends that\nthe Judge either did not consider or that she mis-weighed favorable record evidence, for example\nApplicant\u2019s debt repayment plans and her excellent work ethic.  A Judge is presumed to have\nconsidered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.\n20, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal has not rebutted that presumption.  Neither has it\ndemonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-10821 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2006); ISCR Case No. 09- 03724 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2010). Furthermore, we observe that there is nothing in the plain 3 language of the Guideline to support Applicant\u2019s contention. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-00951 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. For example, she challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she overspends her monthly income by approximately $1,600. Applicant also challenges the statement quoted above concerning her having been steadily employed for two years. She asserts that, as a contract employee, there have been periods during the past two years in which she has not worked. Regarding the first challenge, Applicant submitted an exhibit containing budget information for a single month. This exhibit reflects expenditures that exceed Applicant\u2019s income, though by a slightly les",

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on August 14, 2008. On January 25, 2010, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n  \n On February 4, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to   \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March \nMay 13, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n12, 2010. On March 25, 2010, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling Applicant\u2019s \nhearing for April 12, 2010. On that date, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified \non her own behalf and called two witnesses. She introduced 19 exhibits, which were \nmarked as Ex. A through Ex. S. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without \nobjection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business \non April 19, 2010, so that Applicant could, if she wished, provide additional \ndocumentation for the record. Applicant timely provided 21 pages of additional \ndocumentation, which I marked as Ex. T (nine pages); Ex. U (two pages); Ex. V (two \npages); and Ex. W (eight pages). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on April \n21, 2010. \n \n  \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 15 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.o.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted 14 of the allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d through 1.o.) She denied the \nallegation at \u00b6 1.c. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact. \n(Answer to SOR; Tr. 34-56.) \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old, divorced, and the mother of two daughters, who are 19 \nand 17 years old. Applicant supports both daughters and a 15-month-old grandson. In \n2001, Applicant earned a Bachelor of Science degree, and in 2003, she was awarded a \nMaster of Science degree. Her current annual salary is $54,000. The government \ncontractor sponsoring her for a security clearance has offered her an annual salary of \napproximately $60,000, if she acquires a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 58-60, 63-65, \n93.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former husband, an immigrant, was deported to his country of origin \nfor criminal activity. He did not provide child support for his two daughters. Applicant \nrelied on welfare and other social service programs to subsidize her living and \neducation expenses. She owes two student loan debts, one for $54,415 and the other \nfor $47,338.1 As of January 2010, the loans were no longer in deferment. Applicant is \nobligated to pay $278 each month in interest on the two loans. At her hearing, she \nstated that she had not made the required payments for three months. (Tr. 60-66, 88-\n89.) \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s student loan indebtedness was not alleged in the SOR. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is responsible for 15 delinquent debts totaling \n$14,712.2 One of those debts arose when Applicant purchased furniture from a creditor \nin 2001. Thereafter, she lost her job and was unable to make payments on the debt. Her \ncredit bureau reports show that she owes the creditor approximately $3,776 on a \njudgment entered against her in February 2004. Applicant admitted the debt and \nreported that she had made two payments of $100 to the creditor in 2008, although her \nbank was unable to honor the second payment because there were insufficient funds in \nher account. The creditor then sought court approval for enforcement of the judgment \nthrough garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages. Applicant made two small payments on the \ndebt in 2010. In a post-hearing submission, she provided documentation establishing \nthat, beginning May 14, 2010, the creditor would receive eight bi-weekly deposits of \n$350 from her pay to settle the debt for $2,800. This debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n(Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Ex. G; Ex. L; Ex. O; Ex. U; Tr. 35-38, 67-70.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $945 to a \ntelephone company, and, as of January 25, 2010, the debt had not been paid. Applicant \nadmitted the debt but denied she owed the entire amount. At her hearing, she stated \nthat she had disputed the debt. She also stated she would pay the debt in the future. In \na post-hearing submission, she provided a copy of a letter she had written on April 16, \n2010, to the credit reporting agencies requesting that the debt be removed from her \ncredit report because the balance on the account was $300 when the service was   \ndisconnected, and the account was closed four years ago. (Ex. W; Tr. 41-44.) \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.d. that Applicant owed a creditor $4,910 on a delinquent \naccount. Applicant provided documentation establishing that the creditor had agreed to \nsettle the account for $2,757 and that she had made the following payments on the \naccount: $250 in October 2009; $250 in November 2009; $766 in February 2010; and \n$766 in March 2010. Applicant\u2019s documentation also established that she had agreed to \nmake a final payment of $725 on the debt no later than April 23, 2010. (Ex. N; Ex .V; Tr. \n39-45, 70-74.) \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant acknowledged that the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e. ($292); 1.f. ($329); 1.h. ($70); 1.i. ($105); 1.m. ($100); and 1.o. ($254) had not \nbeen paid. In a post-hearing submission, she provided documentation establishing that \non April 14 and 15, 2010, she had written to the creditors identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.f., \n1.h., and 1.m. and had made settlement proposals. (Ex. C; Ex. M; Ex. W; Tr. 46-50, 53-\n56.) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation establishing that the delinquent debts alleged \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. ($574) and 1.n. ($438) referred to the same account. She stated that \nshe made payments on the account occasionally. She also acknowledged a $1,692 \ndelinquent account alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. and stated that she made payments to the \ncreditor when she was able to do so. (Ex. F; Ex. K; Ex. M; Tr. 51-55.) \n \n2 Applicant denied responsibility for a $180 medical debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. She was unable to identify \nthe creditor. The Government did not produce any evidence to further identify the debt. (Tr. 44-45.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate that the $428 delinquent debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l. had been paid off and satisfied in full. She stated she had made \npayoff arrangements with the creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.j. ($291) and expected the \ndelinquent debt to paid off soon. (Ex. Q; Ex. R; Tr. 50, 53.)   \n \n \nApplicant hopes to purchase a home in the near future. She has not had formal \ncredit counseling. She relies on a financial self-help program in managing her finances \nand paying her debts. Using her self-help financial program, she prepared a personal \nfinancial statement, which she submitted after the hearing for inclusion in the record. \n(Ex. B; Ex. T; Tr. 75-78.)  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement showed that her net monthly income is \n$2,6003. She listed her monthly expenses in four categories: household expenses: \n$2,060; restaurant, food, groceries: $695; auto expense: $270; insurance and medical \nexpenses: $515. Additionally, Applicant planned to set aside $200 a month for paying \nher debts. Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement showed that she spent $1,680 more \nthan she earned each month. (Ex.T.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that her father helps her with some of her living expenses. Her \nfather, who appeared as a witness on her behalf, confirmed that he provided Applicant \nwith financial assistance. Neither Applicant nor her father specified the amount or the \ndegree of financial assistance that he provided to her on a regular basis. Applicant\u2019s \ngood friend also testified as a witness on Applicant\u2019s behalf. She stated that she \nbelieved Applicant to be an honorable and honest person. (Tr. 80, 87, 106, 107, 110-\n112.) \n \n                                                          Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n \n3 Applicant stated that she received a rent subsidy from a community housing commission, but she did \nnot specify the amount of the subsidy. (Tr. 79.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \n       \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.   \n \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debt that remained unsatisfied for several \nyears. She was unable or unwilling to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the \nfinancially delinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might \napply. If \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply. If \u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply. If \u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 20(d) might apply. Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies date to a least 2001, \nand they have continued to the present time. Moreover, each month she spends \napproximately $1,680 more than she earns. While Applicant\u2019s current financial \ndelinquencies do not involve large sums of money, she lives beyond her means, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthereby increasing her financial instability and her indebtedness. Applicant has not had \nfinancial credit counseling, and her financial difficulties occurred under circumstances \nthat are likely to recur. Her financial delinquencies cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nThe record does not include facts that suggest protracted conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control that would explain her failure over a period of years to meet her \nfinancial obligations. While she experienced periodic unemployment, divorce, and the \nchallenges of raising two children as a single parent, she has also acquired a college \neducation and an advanced degree. She has been steadily employed for approximately \ntwo years.  \n \nApplicant provided documentation to establish that she had paid one of the debts \nalleged on the SOR. However, most of her debts, some of them for $100 or less, remain \nunpaid. She provided post-hearing evidence that she has attempted to settle or dispute \nsome of her debts. Her personal financial statement indicates that she lacks a plan to \navoid financial overextension in the future. According to her budget, she spends more \nthan she earns each month. While Applicant\u2019s intention to satisfy her creditors is \nlaudable, she has failed to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility. She \nhas not yet demonstrated priorities that emphasize paying her existing debts and \navoiding additional financial delinquencies in the future. While I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) and 20(d) apply in part to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case, I also conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(c), and 20(e) do not apply to her case.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has worked hard \n\n \n8 \n \n \nto acquire an education and to care for her two daughters and her grandson. She has \nbeen steadily employed for at least two years. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was a mature adult.  While she \nrecently established a payment plan to satisfy a judgment pending since 2004, she has \nfailed to demonstrate that she has developed a long-term strategy to satisfy her \ncreditors and that she understands how to avoid excessive debt in the future. She \nappears to have a monthly deficit of over $1,600, putting in doubt her ability to make \nconsistent payments to reduce her debt in the future. \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude, \nafter a careful review of the facts of her case, the Financial Considerations adjudicative \nguideline, and the whole person concept, that Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her financial delinquencies. If she wishes, and if her employer \nsupports reapplication, Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the \ndate that this decision becomes final. At that time, she can produce new evidence that \naddresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n           Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.b.:  \n   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n                      For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. \u2013 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m. \u2013 1.o.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \n \n                                                Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nOctober 12, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn December 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn February 4, 2010, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 4, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 12, 2010, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on May 7, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 7,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibit A, at the time of hearing which was also admitted without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on May 17, 2010. I granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to keep the record open until May 21, 2010, to submit additional documents.\n\n2\nApplicant timely submitted additional documents, which have been identified collectively\nand entered into evidence as Exhibit B. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations 1.a.,through 1.e., and\n1.g., and he denied 1.f. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is married and has two children. Applicant is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists seven allegations (1.a. through 1.g.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  The allegations will be discussed below in the same\norder as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $74.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt had not been paid, but it was included as one of the debts in the\nbankruptcy that he filed in March 2010. (Tr at 24, 34.) Exhibit A consists of the\nbankruptcy documents, filed by Applicant. It establishes that this debt was included in\nthis bankruptcy.  \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $529. Applicant\ntestified that this debt had initially been $729. It had been reduced to $529, after he had\nmade several payments, but then he was unable to make additional payments so he\nincluded it in his bankruptcy. (Tr at 24-25.) Exhibit A establishes that this debt was\nincluded on this bankruptcy. \n \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $7,929. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was for a vehicle that he voluntarily allowed to be repossessed.\nHe averred that he included it on his bankruptcy. (Tr at 25.) Exhibit A establishes that\nthis debt was included in this bankruptcy. \n \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $100. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was not paid, but he included it in his bankruptcy. (Tr at 26.)\nExhibit A establishes that this debt was included in this bankruptcy.   \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $10,112. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was not paid, but he included it in his bankruptcy. (Tr at 26.)\nExhibit A establishes that this debt was included in this bankruptcy, although the\namount listed as owed was $7,143. \n \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,169. Applicant\ndenied this allegation in his RSOR, and at the hearing he testified that this debt was not\nhis because he was a victim of identity theft. He has been trying to get it resolved by\ngoing to the creditor and explaining this was not his debt. However, he has been\nunsuccessful resolving this debt, so he included it in his bankruptcy. (Tr at 26-28.)\nExhibit A establishes that this debt was included in this bankruptcy. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,044. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was not paid, but he included it on his bankruptcy. (Tr at 29.)\nExhibit A establishes that this debt was included in this bankruptcy, although the\namount listed as owed was $3,523. \nApplicant testified that the primary reason for his financial difficulties was that in\nthe years from approximately 2000 to 2004, he was laid off from his employment for\nperiods from two months to six months for each of those years. (Tr at 31-32.) He\ntestified that he eventually increased his income after changing jobs in 2005, and he\ntried to pay off his bills. However, when his wife lost her job in 2009, he believed that the\nonly way that he would be able to resolve these debts was by filing bankruptcy. (Tr at\n36-39.) Applicant testified that he and his wife do not use credit cards and they do not\nplan to use them in the future, and they now have more income than outgoing debts. (Tr\nat 53-54.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted nine very positive character letters in Exhibit B, from people\nwho have known him in his personal and professional life.  He was described by his\nformer supervisor as, \u201cdependable, very professional and had a full understanding at\nany task at hand.\u201d Another former supervisor stated Applicant \u201calways had a great\nattitude, a team player, and was always eager to provide a high level of customer\nservice. I would recommend [Applicant] and believe he would be an asset to any team.\u201d \nAlso, while it was submitted long after the deadline for receiving evidence,\nApplicant did send an email on June 14, 2010, in which he wrote that his bankruptcy\nwas granted, and he received a discharge \u201cunder section 727 of title 11.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that his financial problems resulted from the periods of two to\nsix months of unemployment every year for several years, when he was laid off. I find\nthat he acted responsibly, as he initially attempted to pay off his debts when his new\nemployment gradually increased his income. However, when his wife lost her job, and\nhe did not believe he would have sufficient income to pay off his debts, he also used the\nlegal remedy of bankruptcy to ultimately resolve his overdue bills. Therefore, I find that\nthis potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nAG \u00b6  20(d) is also applicable since Applicant has \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d by use of the legal means of\nbankruptcy. I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial concerns of the\nGovernment.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply, considered with the very positive\ncharacter letters, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no significant questions\nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the\nwhole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on September 11, 2008. On March 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have his \ncase decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. On May 27, 2009, he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. \nI convened a hearing on July 15, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 \nthrough 4 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and called no witnesses. He introduced sixteen exhibits, which were identified \nand marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through P and admitted to the record without objection.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of \nbusiness July 22, 2009, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the \nrecord. Applicant timely filed 14 additional documents, which were marked as Ex. Q \nthrough Z and AA through DD. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted to \nthe record without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on July \n23, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains sixteen allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.p.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted thirteen of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.i., 1.j., \n1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., and 1.p.); he denied three allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.h., and 1.o.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 46-65, 83-\n96, 112-133.)  \n \n \nApplicant seeks a security clearance. He is 32 years old and, since September \n2008, he has been employed as an enterprise management engineer by a government \ncontractor. He has been married to his wife for five years, and they are the parents of \nthree young children. Applicant\u2019s annual gross salary is approximately $75,000. His \nwife, who is not employed outside of the home, manages the family\u2019s finances. (Ex. 1; \nEx. R; Tr. 68-69, 109, 138, 146-147.) \n \n \nApplicant is a high school graduate. He attended college for a time and estimates \nthat he achieved sophomore or junior status. Since September of 1997, he has worked \nfor a variety of employers as a computer technician and specialist. From December \n2004 until September 2008, he worked for a municipal government as a security \nengineer. His highest annual salary in that job was $70,000.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 70-75, 137-\n140.) \n \n \nIn 2005, when his annual salary was approximately $65,000, Applicant and his \nwife purchased a home, which was financed by a first mortgage of approximately \n$125,000 and a second mortgage of approximately $30,000. In 2006, Applicant\u2019s \nmother, who lived in a neighboring state, fell ill and required two surgeries in one month. \nDuring this time, Applicant and his wife drove frequently to his mother\u2019s home to be with \nher. Applicant found that he needed to use his disposable income to purchase gasoline \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor the trips to visit his mother, and he fell behind in paying some of his financial \nobligations, including his home mortgages. He contacted the mortgagor and requested \na reduced payment plan. The mortgagor complied, and after about nine or ten months \non the payment plan, Applicant was able to catch up and became current on his \nmortgage payments.  In mid to late 2007, Applicant again fell behind in his mortgage \npayments, and after four months on a payment plan, he became current again on his \nmortgages. In September 2008, Applicant resigned from his job. He took a position with \nhis current employer and moved his family to another city. He was unable to sell his \nhouse, and he did not have sufficient funds to pay his mortgages. (Tr. 48-49, 135-137.)  \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was over 180 days past due in \nthe approximate amount of $10,946 on the $125,776 mortgage and over 180 days past \ndue in the approximate amount of $1,860 on the $30,962 mortgage. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j. and \n1.k.)  The lender has offered to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure from Applicant and \nhis wife, but the final terms of the agreement were not in place at the time of his \nhearing, and the debts were not resolved. When he completed his e-QIP in September \n2008, Applicant reported his mortgage delinquency of $125,776 and stated: \u201cThis is the \nonly thing that is past due on my credit report.\u201d (Tr. 49-50, 123.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of September 30, 2008 revealed 13 debts in collection \nstatus. Those debts were alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.g., SOR \u00b6 1.i., and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l., to \n1.p. Additionally, the SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that Applicant was 30 days past due in \nmaking a payment of $137 on a debt of $2,423. (Ex. 4; SOR.) \n \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and provided a \nmonthly budget and a long-range plan to satisfy his delinquent debts. He stated that he \nintended to pay the $105 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. in March 2009 and the \n$163 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. in April 2009. He further stated he intended to \npay the $367 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. with three monthly payments of $123 in \nMay, June, and July of 2009; he intended to pay the $476 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.p. in four monthly payments of $120 from August through November 2009; he \nintended to pay the $726 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.n. in seven monthly payments \nof $110 from December 2009 to June 2010; and he intended to satisfy the $1,024 \ndelinquency alleged  at SOR \u00b6 1.m. with eight monthly payments of $128 from July \n2010 to February 2011. (Ex. 2 at 4-5.) \n \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, he also expressed his intention to \nsatisfy the $1,595 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. in 12 monthly payments of $133 \nbetween March 2011 and 2012, and he expressed his intention to satisfy the $2,035 \ndelinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. in 15 monthly payments of $136 between April 2012 \nand June 2013. (Ex. 2 at 5.) \n \n \nIn his April 23, 2009, answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he intended to pay \nthe debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. in July 2009. He stated that he intended to pay the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. in August 2009. He stated he was currently paying the debt \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d, and he stated he had paid the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Answer \nto SOR.) \n \n \nAt his July 15, 2009, hearing, Applicant stated that he intended to satisfy his \nsmaller debts first and pay the larger debts in the future. He stated he did not intend to \ncontact his creditors until he was ready to pay them. As his Ex. A, he provided a third \niteration of his plan to satisfy his debts. He acknowledged that none of the three plans \nindicated how he intended to satisfy the $2,240 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. He also \nacknowledged that he had not contacted the creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In his third \nplan describing his intention to pay the creditors identified on the SOR, he stated that \nthe $105 delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. would be satisfied in June 2009. He \nstated that the debt had been incurred in 2001 or 2002.  He reported that his wife was \nplanning to hand a check for $105 to the creditor. As a post-hearing document, he \nprovided a receipt corroborating a payment of $25 on the debt on July 21, 2009.  (Ex. A; \nEx. U; Tr. 57, 83-84, 8-93.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that, in addition to the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a., he intended to \npay the following delinquent debts alleged on the SOR at some future date: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \n($649), 1.e. ($2,116), 1.i. ($1,595), 1.m. ($1,024), 1.n. ($726), and 1.p. ($476). He \nstated he planned to pay the $163 delinquency alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. in August 2009. \nHe provided documentation to corroborate that he had paid the $624 delinquent debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l., and he provided documentation to corroborate a payment of $20 \non the $367 delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. He claimed he had paid the $235 \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f., but he failed to provide documentation to corroborate \npayment. Additionally, he claimed he had disputed the $137 delinquent debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.1 and the $58 delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.o., but he failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his disputations. (Ex. M; Ex. CC; Tr. 57-65.)         \n \n \n \n   Applicant is paid once a month. His net take-home pay is $4,076.45.  His \nmonthly fixed expenses are as follows: rent: $1,600; groceries: $500; clothing: $100; \ngas: $100; electricity: $130; water: $65; trash collection: $20; telephone: $156; and cell \nphones for himself and his wife: $210.  He estimates his monthly out-of-pocket medical \nexpenses are about $20. He budgets $100 for miscellaneous expenses.  (Ex. R; Ex. 2; \nTr. 52, 145-149.)  \n \n \nAdditionally, in 2008, Applicant\u2019s mother signed a purchase agreement on his \nbehalf for a new 2008 model automobile which cost $28,000. Applicant pays $600 a \nmonth directly to the automobile creditor. He estimates that his additional monthly car \nexpenses include $260 for gas for his automobile and his wife\u2019s automobile, $150 for \nautomobile insurance, and $10 for oil changes and maintenance. (Tr. 149-155, 157.) \n \n \n1 Applicant claimed that he had paid the creditor over $4,000 to satisfy this debt and he denied he owed \nthe remaining $137. However, he failed to provide documentation to corroborate his claim. (Ex. Y; Tr. \n114-115. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net remainder at the end of each month is approximately $55. He \nlacks sufficient resources to pay additional medical bills which arose when his third child \nwas born. These debts are outstanding, and his mother subsidizes his income each \nmonth by paying about $100 of those medical bills. Additionally, Applicant owes a tax \ndebt of $14,000, including interest and penalties, to the Internal Revenue Service, and \nhe has agreed to pay $200 each month to reduce his federal tax debt. When asked \nwhere he obtained the money to pay the tax debt, he stated: \u201c[W]e take it out of \ngroceries, we take it out of utilities, whatever we don\u2019t use. And we\u2019ve never been late. \nWe do - - - what is it - - - rob Peter to pay Paul.\u201d (Ex. S; Tr. 157-161.) \n \n \nApplicant presented six letters of character reference from supervisors, co-\nworkers, and former colleagues. The letters of character reference emphasized \nApplicant\u2019s \ndependability, \nexcellent \ntechnical \nskills, \nstrong \nwork \nethic, \nand \nprofessionalism. (Ex. F; Ex. G; Ex. H; Ex. I; Ex. J; Ex. K.) \n \n \nApplicant has not sought or received professional consumer credit counseling. \n(Tr. 172-173.)  \n    \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Additionally, under AG \u00b6 19(e), a security concern can be raised \nwhen there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, \nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt, was \nunable or unwilling to pay his creditors, and consistently spent beyond his means. This \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g.,loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from   \nat least 2001 or 2002 to the present time. When his mother fell ill and required surgeries \nin 2006, Applicant drove great distances to visit her, and this cost him money in \ngasoline. Fortunately, Applicant\u2019s mother recovered, and he has, for the most part, been \nsteadily employed since that time. His annual income is approximately $75,000. \n \n Applicant is financially overextended, and he has few resources available to pay \nhis delinquent debts at this time. He hopes to pay most of his creditors in the future, but \nhe has difficulty meeting his basic expenses each month, a situation that casts doubt on \nhis ability to plan realistically for the future. He provided documentation to corroborate \nthat he had paid a debt of $624, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to prove that he had satisfied a debt of $235, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. He \nalso failed to provide documentation to corroborate that he had contested debts alleged \nat \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.o.    \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He relies on his wife to manage \nhis income, and he relies on his mother to provide him with extra money to meet his \nexpenses. While he admitted his financial delinquencies, it was not clear that he \nunderstood his financial problems or how to resolve them. He was financially over-\n\n \n8 \n \n \nextended and had very little money left at the end of each month. In spite of this, he \npurchased a new automobile for $28,000 in 2008, and his automobile expenses \nconsume a substantial portion of his monthly disposable income. He uses money \nbudgeted for food or other basic living expenses to pay his federal tax debt each month. \nHe has no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial delinquent debt and \nprepare for future contingencies. I conclude that none of the Financial Consideration \nmitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 32 \nyears. His supervisors and colleagues consider him to be diligent, hard-working, and \nprofessional. They appreciate his technical skills and dependability.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began at least seven years ago. He has not \npursued financial counseling. Despite an annual income of $75,000, he has not taken \naffirmative action to live within his means and to pay or resolve his substantial \ndelinquent debts. His lack of attention to his financial delinquencies continues to raise \nsecurity concerns. Despite a steady income for several years, he failed to budget his \nincome to satisfy his many delinquent debts. Instead, he continued on a pattern of \noverextension. He has a low net remainder at the end of every month, and he appears \nunable to meet his financial obligations, raising concerns about his judgment and \npotential financial vulnerability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhis financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.k.:           Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n          For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m. - 1.p. :         Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 21, 2008. On \nDecember 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 15, 2009; answered it in an undated \ndocument; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nJune 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on January 4, 2010. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 31, \n2020, and the case was assigned to me on February 5, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 5, 2010, scheduling the hearing for March 30, 2010. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel and Applicant both submitted demonstrative exhibits \nsummarizing the evidence, which are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I \nand II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 5, 2010.  \n \nI kept the record open until April 19, 2010, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX H through X. On April 28, \n2010, he submitted AX Y. Department Counsel did not object to AX H through X or the \nuntimely submission of AX Y, and they were admitted. Department Counsel\u2019s comments \nregarding AX H through X are attached to the record as HX III. The record closed on \nApril 28, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n1.e-1.h, and 1.j-1.n. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since August 1996. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nbusiness management in June 2004, and he expects to receive a master\u2019s degree in \nengineering management in the spring of 2011. (AX B; AX G-17; Tr. 54.)  \n \nApplicant married in August 1973 and divorced in February 1989. He remarried \nin March 1990 and separated in December 2005. Since November 2006, he has been \ncohabiting and in a committed relationship with a woman who was a family friend before \nshe divorced her husband and Applicant separated from his wife. (AX C-21; Tr. 29-31.)  \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1970 to May \n1974. (AX F-1.) He was discharged from the Air Force and enlisted in the Army National \nGuard in January 1975. (AX F-2; AX F-3.) He served in the Army National Guard from \nSeptember 1975 to June 1982. (AX F-5.) He has held a clearance since October 1981. \n(GX 3, Item 31.)  \n \n \nApplicant lost his job shortly after his divorce in 1989. He then had custody of the \nthree children from his first marriage. On the advice of his lawyer, he filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and received a discharge in March 1992. (GX 7; Tr. 66, 106.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s second wife, who had a business background, managed the family \nfinances until they separated in December 2005. Between 2002 and 2004, Applicant \ndiscovered his wife had opened at least six credit card accounts without his knowledge \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand was \u201cfloating\u201d the account balances, using one credit card account to pay the \nbalance on another. (Tr. 69.) After they separated, he found that their financial records \nwere in disarray. He asked a friend with experience as a bookkeeper (now his \ncohabitant) to assist him in early 2006, but she could not reconcile the accounts. \nApplicant opened a new bank account because of his inability to reconcile the marital \naccount. (Tr. 31-34; 71-74.) Applicant was aware of two auto loans that were in arrears \nand some delinquent medical bills. (Tr. 35, 72.)  \n \n \nAfter his separation, Applicant was ordered to pay spousal support of $2,711 per \nmonth, which is collected directly from his pay. (GX 6 at 9.) From 2006 to 2008, his \nspouse refused to sell the marital home, and the market value of the home declined \nduring that period. (AX C-19.) When the home was eventually sold in May 2009, the \nproceeds were held in escrow. (GX 6 at 18; Tr. 40.) In December 2009, Applicant \nreceived $20,000 from the sale of the marital home, which he used to resolve as many \ndelinquent debts as possible. (Tr. 40. 75-77.) He recently received his income tax \nrefund of $8,597, which he has used to resolve the debt for apartment rent alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h.

He has filed a complaint with the state attorney \ngeneral\u2019s office. (AX J.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement in July 2009. It reflects gross monthly income of about $10,808, net monthly \nincome after deductions (including a deduction of $2,713 for spousal support) of $3,102, \nmonthly expenses of $2,501, and a net remainder of $601. (GX 6 at 4.) His cohabitant\u2019s \nincome is limited to monthly Social Security payments and disability payments from the \nstate. The record does not reflect the amounts of those payments. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he expected that his divorce would be final \nwithin about a month. When it is final, his spousal support payments will be reduced by \nat least $450 per month. (AX C-19 at 3; Tr. 68.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his cohabitant share all household expenses and jointly manage \nthe household budget. Before he received his share of the proceeds from the sale of the \nmarital home, he borrowed money from his cohabitant to pay his share of the household \nexpenses, but he has since repaid her. His cohabitant testified he has not incurred any \ndelinquent accounts since they began cohabiting (Tr. 41-43.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated March 30, 2010 reflected a medical collection \naccount for $895. (GX 14 at 1.) Applicant could not explain this collection account at the \nhearing. (Tr. 88.) However, after the hearing, he submitted evidence that he had \ndisputed the credit report entry, and it had been removed from his credit report. (AX X.) \n \n \nApplicant is a talented, well-trained, creative, experienced engineer who has \nreceived numerous awards for leadership and engineering excellence. (AX C-1 through \nC-12; AX D; AX E; AX G-1 through G-16.) He is highly respected among supervisors, \nproject managers, and peers. Numerous colleagues and supervisors submitted \ntestimonials to Applicant\u2019s candor, honesty, diligence, and reliability. All held current \nsecurity clearances and were aware of his pending divorce and his financial situation. \n(AX C-13 through C-18.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts. Two of those debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h) \nare duplicates. All but one have been resolved. One debt arising from an automobile \nrepossession (SOR \u00b6 1.i) is disputed.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nAll three disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts were recent and numerous. They occurred because he did not pay attention to \nthe family finances and his wife was financially irresponsible. Applicant has learned his \nlesson about neglecting his financial responsibilities, and he and his irresponsible wife \nhave parted ways, making another financial disaster unlikely to recur. He acted \nresponsibly after the marital breakup, enlisting the help of his cohabitant to use her \nbookkeeping experience to evaluate his financial situation, minimizing his living \nexpenses, borrowing money from his cohabitant to pay current expenses, and resolving \nhis delinquent debts when the proceeds from the sale of the marital home finally \nbecame available. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n \nApplicant encountered several conditions beyond his control: his spouse\u2019s \nfinancial irresponsibility, the high costs of an acrimonious divorce, the refusal of his \nspouse to dispose of the marital home until the real estate market plummeted, and the \nrefusal of the domestic relations court to release the proceeds from the sale of the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfamily home until all issues in the divorce were resolved. He acted responsibly by \nreviewing his financial records, reducing his living expenses, borrowing money from his \ncohabitant to pay some of his debts and living expenses. Once the marital assets were \nreleased, he repaid his cohabitant and paid as many delinquent debts as he could. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case \nNo. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that \nan applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. Id. \n \nApplicant was living on a tight budget until the marital home was sold and the \nproceeds distributed in January 2010. He has paid or resolved all his delinquent debts \nexcept the auto repossession in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which he has disputed. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h and 1.j-1.n. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nhas disputed the amount of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i because he has not received \ncredit for the sale of the repossessed property. He has documented the basis for the \ndispute. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent, talented, well-educated man. He has served his \ncountry for many years in the armed forces and as an employee of a defense \ncontractor. He has held a clearance for many years without incident. He is devoted to \nhis work, to the extent that he completely entrusted his financial well-being to his \nspouse while he focused exclusively on being an engineer. He has learned, however, \nthat his responsibilities extend beyond the workplace, and he now actively participates \nin the financial management of his household. He has a reputation for being candid, \ntruthful, and reliable. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 28, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 4, 2009. Department Counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on July 28, 2009. The case was assigned to me on July 30, \n1 \n \nApril 30, 2010\n\n2 \n \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 21, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 24, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until October 9, 2009, to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant submitted AE K \nthrough U, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on October 2, 2009. The record closed on October 9, 2009. On February 16, 2010, \nI received an e-mail from the Applicant advising that he would be contacting the creditor \nfor SOR \u00b6 1.i. (charged off account for $67,937) to confirm the debt was paid as well as \nprovide status updates on the remaining unresolved SOR debts. (Feb. 16, 2010 e-mail \nmarked as Ex. I.) As of the decision issuing date, I have not received any additional \ninformation from the Applicant. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old circuit design electrical engineer, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since July 2007. He seeks to renew his secret \nsecurity clearance, which he has successfully held for approximately 12 years. \nMaintaining a clearance is not a condition of his continued employment; however, \nwithout a clearance, he will be limited to working on non-classified programs. (GE 1, GE \n3, Tr. 17, 21-22, 33-35.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1981. He later attended a \nuniversity from August 1995 to August 2000, and was awarded a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in Electrical Engineering in May 2000. He has never married and has no \ndependents. (GE 1, GE 3, Tr. 35-37.) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his August 2000 security clearance application (SF-86), his \nAugust 2008 e-QIP as well as his April 2001, September 2008, March 2009, April 2009, \nand July 2009 credit reports. (GE 1 \u2013 8.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 12 separate debts - one past-due account, one tax \nlien, two collection accounts, and eight charged-off accounts, totaling $215,797. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.l.) \n \n\n3 \n \nUntil 2006, Applicant was financially solvent, had a credit score in the 700s, \nowned property, had a viable retirement account, and money in the bank. In mid-2006, \nhis former fianc\u00e9e introduced him to an investment group that identified investors with \ngood credit, such as the Applicant to (1) cash out the equity in their homes, (2) open \ncredit card accounts and withdraw the maximum cash advances allowed, and (3) cash \nout their retirement plans and turn those funds over to the investment group. The \ninvestment group in turn would buy homes, rent them, and the rental income they \nreceived from tenants would theoretically cover the monthly mortgage payments. The \ninvestment group represented to the investors that they would reap quick returns up to \nthree times their investment in a relatively short time.  \n \nApplicant owned a single family home and a condominium. He refinanced those \ntwo properties and turned over the equity he received to the investment group. In mid-\n2006, the investment group bought two properties with those funds and listed the \nApplicant as the owner of those two properties. Applicant was to forward monthly \nmortgage bills to the investment group for reimbursement. Applicant remained legally \nresponsible for all payments on these newly acquired properties. (Response to SOR, \nAE E, Tr. 60, 85-88.) \n \nThe investment group also opened credit cards in Applicant\u2019s name and withdrew \nthe maximum amount of cash possible from these newly opened accounts. The \ninvestment group invested these funds in \u201csomething\u201d that was supposed to double \nApplicant\u2019s money in one year. As with the real property, Applicant was to forward credit \ncard bills to the investment group for reimbursement of minimum monthly payments. As \nwith mortgage payments, Applicant remained legally responsible for making the \nminimum payments on these credit cards. (Response to SOR, AE E.) Applicant \nexplained that only \u201ctwo or three\u201d of the credit cards on the SOR were his. He also \nstated he expected his return \u201cin six months to a year . . . would be, you know, two, \nthree times what it was.\u201d(Tr. 43, 85-88.)  \n \nApplicant liquidated his IRA and Roth IRA, also with an understanding he would \nnet a substantial and quick return. Applicant stated he handed over \u201cclose to [a] half a \nmillion [dollars] ($500,000)\u201d to the investment group in total. (Response to SOR, Tr. 58-\n59.)  \n \nIn January 2007, a law firm filed a class action suit against the investment group \nand was granted a temporary restraining order against the investment group, which \namong other things, froze all funds held by them. At his hearing, Applicant was unable \nto provide any status updates of this litigation. He testified that he has not had any \ncommunication from the law firm representing the plaintiffs since their initial January \n2007 letter. The investment group was unable to dispense funds to investors, funds they \nneeded to cover their monthly mortgage and credit card payments. This had disastrous \nfinancial repercussions for the Applicant. (Response to SOR, AE E, Tr. 44, 88-91.) Until \nthen, Applicant received sufficient funds from the investment group to cover monthly \nexpenses related to his investment expenses. As far as profit or return on his $500,000 \ninvestment, Applicant testified that he received nothing or \u201czero\u201d from the investment \ngroup. (Tr. 59, 85-88.)  \n\n4 \n \n \nTo deal with his pressing debt, Applicant retained the services of a law firm \nspecializing in debt resolution (law firm) in January 2009. He had been referred to this \nlaw firm by a credit counseling service in December 2008. (Response to SOR, AE E \n(Section 2).) Applicant submitted a list of creditors to the law firm and they in turn \nnegotiate settlements with creditors. Applicant remits $587 per month by direct debit to \nthe law firm to fund his client trust fund. The law firm\u2019s fee for their services as well as \npayments to creditors comes directly from a client trust fund. (Response to SOR, AE A, \nAE E(Section 2).) \n \nApplicant identified the following debts for resolution: (1) SOR \u00b6 1.a. credit card \ncharged off account $7,291, (2) SOR \u00b6 1.b. credit card charged off account $13,738, (3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. credit card charged off account $3,631, (4) SOR \u00b6 1.d. credit card charged \noff account $6,755, (5) SOR \u00b6 1.e. credit card charged off account $1,658, (6) SOR \u00b6 \n1.f. credit card charged off account $9,835, (7) SOR \u00b6 1.g. credit card charged off \naccount $4,854, and (8) SOR \u00b6 1.l. credit card collection account $6,958.  \n \nIn January 2009, the law firm wrote to each of the eight identified creditors with \nwhat could be referred to as a \u201cno contact letter.\u201d As of the hearing date, the law firm \nhad settled and paid the three creditors identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g. (AE A, \nAE E, AE O, Tr. 37, 61-67.) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b61.k. tax lien $196 had been paid. (AE S, Tr. 81.) These four debts are \nthe only debts from the 12 debts alleged for which Applicant submitted sufficient \ndocumentation of payment or resolution. (Tr. 76-81.) \n \nAdditionally, and most significant are the deficiencies or indebtedness owed on \nthree properties. These debts are: (1) SOR \u00b6 1.h. lender charged off account $70,749, \n(2) SOR \u00b6 1.i. lender charged off account $67,937, and (3) SOR \u00b6 1.j. past-due account \n$22,195 with a balance of $522,000. Applicant was issued a Form 1099-A in the \nrespective amounts of $70,749.44 and $522,000 for the properties associated with \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.j. In July 2009, Applicant received notification that the lender \nholding the note for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. had transferred the loan to another lender. At \nhis hearing, Applicant testified that he received a Form 1099-A from the original lender, \nbut was unable to locate it. To date Applicant has not provided a Form 1099 for this \ndebt. (Response to SOR, AE E, AE E, pgs 30 and 34, AE R, AE V, Tr. 67-75, 80-81.)  \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a Certificate of Counseling documenting that \nhe had completed credit counseling in August 2008. (AE N, Tr. 83-84.) Applicant \ntestified that he earns approximately $80,000 per year and estimated that after he pays \nall his monthly bills, he has a net remainder of $1,500 per month. He no longer is a \nhome owner and rents an apartment; however, he hopes to save enough to purchase \nanother home. He is in the process of rebuilding his retirement account. (Tr. 92-95, AE \nP, AE Q.)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n\n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s department manager testified on his behalf. He stated that he has \nknown the Applicant \u201cabout two years\u201d and observes him on a daily basis. He described \nApplicant as \u201chard working, \u201cvery reliable,\u201d \u201csolid,\u201d \u201cvalued employee,\u201d and has \u201ca \nhundred percent confidence\u201d in Applicant. He described Applicant\u2019s duties and added \nthat if Applicant were not granted a security clearance \u201cour national defense would be \ngreatly reduced.\u201d (Tr. 17-27.) \n \nApplicant submitted several certificates which include an award from a blood \nbank for volunteer donations in 2006, a company award for his contributions for persons \nwith disabilities in 2008, and another company award for outstanding job performance in \n2008. Applicant submitted performance evaluations for the years 2004 through 2009 \nthat reflect sustained solid performance. (AE B \u2013 D.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n6 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and evidence \npresented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.l., he had 12 delinquent debts totaling \n$215,797 that have been in various states of delinquency since 2007. The Government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n7 \n \n                                                          \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b). \nBecause there is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not isolated. \nIt was not until 2009 that Applicant retained the services of a law firm for debt resolution. \nOf eight debts referred to the law firm, only three have been satisfied. Applicant also \npaid one small debt separately. Therefore, his debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d \nunder the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant\u2019s \nsituation was of his own doing. He engaged in financial behavior that \u201cthrew caution to \nthe wind\u201d leaving himself completely vulnerable in a \u201cget rich quick\u201d scheme. Applicant\u2019s \ncollective behavior raises serious questions about his good judgment. See ISCR Case \nNo. 08-08435 (App. Bd. July 16, 2009.) The record does not support a conclusion that \nApplication\u2019s debt arose from causes outside his control. There is no evidence that \nApplicant took any affirmative steps to resolve his debts until January 2009 leaving \nthem dormant for one year.1  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. Although Applicant did seek financial counseling, \nthere are no clear indications that his financial status is under control. There is sufficient \ninformation to establish partial application under AG \u00b6 20(d).2 Applicant has paid or \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nresolved four of the twelve debts alleged. He testified that he has a $1,500 net \nremainder after all his monthly bills are paid, yet he remits only $587 per month to the \nlaw firm to pay down his remaining debts. This explains, in part, why only three of the \ntwelve debts are paid off. He paid his $196 tax lien separately. Applicant offered no \nevidence that he is disputing any of the debts alleged. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists 12 debts \ntotalling $215,797. Applicant refinanced his two properties for purpose of using the \nequity in investment properties. He cashed out his retirement plans for the purpose of \nusing that cash for investment purposes. Lastly, he authorized the investment group to \nopen credit cards in his name for the purpose of drawing cash advances for investment \npurposes. Applicant surrendered all of his net worth, retirement accounts, and good \ncredit to the investment group. They had convinced him he would reap a return of two to \nthree times his investment in a relatively short time. According to Applicant\u2019s testimony, \nhe lost approximately $500,000 and received nothing in return. His lack of judgment and \ndue diligence raises serious questions about his judgment and security worthiness. \nMany creditors are still waiting to be repaid and will most likely be required to accept \nless than full payment and three creditors owed significant balances on real estate \nholdings most likely will never be paid. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is insufficient to \novercome the situation Applicant has created of his own doing. The volatile real estate \nmarket over the past several years does not excuse Applicant\u2019s irresponsible behavior. I \ntook note of his good employment record with a defense contractor, his contributions to \nthe community, and the fact that he is a law-abiding citizen. His monthly expenses are \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n9 \n \ncurrent. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis \nin financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). I \ndo not view Applicant\u2019s monthly payment of $587 he sets aside for debt repayment \nwhile retaining a net monthly remainder of $1,500 as \u201csignificant action.\u201d Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nIn fairness to the Applicant, this decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that he cannot or will not attain the state of financial stability necessary to \njustify the holding of a security clearance. To the contrary, his mitigating evidence and \nwhole-person analysis suggests a sound potential for positive reform and outstanding \naccomplishments in the defense industry. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity \nto reapply for a security clearance, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence \nwarranting a favorable result. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has not fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.d.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e. \u2013 1.g.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h. \u2013 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.g, and 1.j, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 45 years old. They married in December 1985. Their two sons are now 22 and 20 years old. He also has two children with a girlfriend with whom he lived from 1998 to 2003. Those children are eight and nine years old. Applicant pays child support for those children and is current on that obligation. He must also maintain health insurance for them. (Tr. 24-32; Exhibit 1) Applicant works for a defense contractor as a network support specialist. He earns about $51,000 annually. Applicant served in the U.S. Army and had a security clearance during his service from 1984 to 1987. He also had a security clearance when he worked for a defense contractor from 1987 to 1996. He does not have a security clearance now. (Tr. 25-28; Exhibit 1) Applicant has 10 delinquent debts. They total $13,574. Seven of the debts are under $600 each. The remaining three delinquent debts are $1,371, $2,852, and $7,952. Six debts are paid or in the process of being paid on an installment plan basis. They total $10,172. Four debts remain unpaid because Applicant disputes his obligation to pay them or does not have the money at present to pay them. Those debts total $3,372. (Tr. 32-77; Exhibits 2",

On July 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 31, 2009. He answered the \nSOR on August 15, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 30, 2009, and I received \nthe case assignment on October 6, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October \n29 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 17, 2009. The \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 25, 2009. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 2, 2009, to submit \nadditional matters.  On December 22, 2009, he submitted Exhibits C through F, without \nobjection. The record closed on December 22, 2009. Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c to 1.g, and 1.j, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.h, and 1.i. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. They married in December 1985. Their two sons are \nnow 22 and 20 years old. He also has two children with a girlfriend with whom he lived \nfrom 1998 to 2003. Those children are eight and nine years old. Applicant pays child \nsupport for those children and is current on that obligation. He must also maintain health \ninsurance for them. (Tr. 24-32; Exhibit 1) \n \nApplicant works for a defense contractor as a network support specialist. He \nearns about $51,000 annually. Applicant served in the U.S. Army and had a security \nclearance during his service from 1984 to 1987. He also had a security clearance when \nhe worked for a defense contractor from 1987 to 1996. He does not have a security \nclearance now. (Tr. 25-28; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant has 10 delinquent debts. They total $13,574. Seven of the debts are \nunder $600 each. The remaining three delinquent debts are $1,371, $2,852, and \n$7,952. Six debts are paid or in the process of being paid on an installment plan basis. \nThey total $10,172. Four debts remain unpaid because Applicant disputes his obligation \nto pay them or does not have the money at present to pay them. Those debts total \n$3,372. (Tr. 32-77; Exhibits 2-4, E-F) \n \n \nApplicant stated he disputes a $53 medical debt because it resulted from medical \ntreatment his former girlfriend and mother of his two youngest children sought in 2004 \n(Subparagraph 1.a). He is trying to have it removed from his credit report. He did not \nsubmit any documents to show he actually disputed this debt. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 17, 59; Exhibits 2-4)  \n \n \nApplicant paid a $30 debt owed on a returned check from 2005 (Subparagraph \n1.b) on November 13, 2009. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 17, 61; Exhibits 2-4, C)  \n \n \nThe three medical debts ($210, $1,371, and $50) are owed to the same collector. \nThey are debts resulting from medical treatments rendered to his two young children in \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2007. Applicant is paying on an installment plan and made payments on October 13, \n2009, November 13, 2009, and December 31, 2009 (Subparagraph 1.c, 1.d, 1.e). He \npaid $800 and then $100 monthly. These debts are being resolved. (Tr. 18-21, 61-65; \nExhibits 2-4, B, C, D, E)  \n \n \nApplicant owes $2,852 to a collector on a credit card debt (Subparagraph 1.f). \nThis debt was incurred in 2008. The collector is willing to settle the debt for $1,500. \nApplicant would like to accept the settlement, but does not have $1,500 to pay the \ncollector. He is paying other creditors and until they are paid he cannot pay this creditor. \nThis debt is unresolved. (Tr. 18, 68; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant agreed to settle a car loan debt of $7,952 for $4,200 (Subparagraph \n1.g). He paid the creditor $4,200 on November 12, 2009. He co-signed an auto loan \nwith his former girlfriend. The vehicle was repossessed. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 19-\n22, 46, 69; Exhibits 2-4, A, C) \n \n \nApplicant owed $589 to a collector (Subparagraph 1.h). This debt was incurred in \n2006. He paid $375 in a settlement arrangement with the collector. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. 20-22, 70; Exhibits 2-4, F) \n \n \nApplicant disputes the $230 debt owed to a collector for medical care given to his \nformer girlfriend (Subparagraph 1.i). He disputed the debt with the Experian credit \nreporting agencies and had it removed from his record. He is attempting to have the \ndebt removed from the other two national credit reporting agencies. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 20, 70; Exhibits 2-4)  \n \n \nThe final debt is owed to an auto insurance agency in the amount of $237 \n(Subparagraph 1.j). Applicant asserts the debt is so old the company cannot provide \nhim with any information about it. He does not find the debt listed on his Experian credit \nreport. Applicant\u2019s answer admitted this debt. This debt is not paid and is not resolved. \n(Tr. 20, 73; Exhibits 2-4; Answer) \n \n \nApplicant did not file or pay his Federal and state income tax reports for the years \n1990 to 1996. His tax debt was $11,000. He later established an installment payment \nplan with the taxing authorities and paid the debt. Applicant did not file his 2008 income \ntax returns for the Federal and state taxing authorities. He had no explanation why he \ndid not file his returns. He was given additional time after the hearing to file his 2008 \nFederal and state income tax returns, but failed show proof of filing and payment. (Tr. \n51, 75-77; Exhibits 2-4)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n4 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Two of those conditions apply to the facts in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred $13,574 worth of delinquent debts. These debts are owed \nfrom 2004 through 2007. Applicant started paying them in 2009, after he received the \nSOR.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two of the \nmitigating conditions have limited applicability: \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has paid or is paying six of his delinquent debts totaling $10,172. He \ndisputes and has not paid four debts totaling $3,372. However, he has not produced \ndocumentary evidence of his disputes filed with the creditor or the credit reporting \nagencies. These debts have existed for more than two years and Applicant has had \nample opportunity to dispute and resolve these debts in some way. He has not done so. \nThese mitigating conditions do not outweigh the disqualifying conditions on the four \nunpaid debts. He also delayed resolving these debts until 2009, and after the SOR was \nsent to him. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred substantial debt, \nwhich he allowed to become delinquent. He undertook to resolve these debts only after \nhe received the SOR in July 2009, when the earliest debt dates from 2004. Applicant \nwas a mature adult when these debts were incurred. They demonstrate a pattern of \nfinancial mismanagement beginning in and continuing over the past six years. He \nexhibits a blas\u00e9 attitude toward his financial debts. His actions are voluntary. No \nbehavior changes are shown by this pattern of conduct from his actions as shown by his \nhistory of inaction. He failed to file and pay his income tax obligations from 1990 to \n1996, incurring a tax obligation of $11,000. It is likely his financial irresponsibility will \ncontinue in the future, as demonstrated by his failure to file his 2008 income tax returns \neven though given additional time after the hearing to do so and submit proof of filing. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1. i and 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d to 1.i (GE 9). She established that that she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($45) (GE 9 at 3-4). The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.i and 1.n and 1.o pertained to delinquent student loans (GE 9 at 5-7).2 On March 23, 2009, she received an offer of a repayment schedule with a $125 monthly payment starting on March 27, 2009, to address a balance owed on six student loan accounts of $8,302 (GE 9 at 6). A handwritten note indicated the medical debt of $228 in SOR \u00b6 1.p was settled for $148 and paid using a money gram (GE 9 at 9-10). A March 18, 2009, letter from the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r ($1,671), 1.s ($2,110), and 1.t ($563) indicated the debts were transferred to a different creditor (GE 9 at 19). Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6). In 1989, she graduated from high school, and she has completed some credits towards her bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 6, 36). She majored in business administration (Tr. 7). She has never been married and does not have any children (Tr. 7).

She paid two debts. Seven student loans were duplicated in the SOR. She \nconsolidated her student loans into one debt for $7,784, and established a payment \nplan. She has established payment plans on all of the other SOR debts, except for three \ndebts, which total $6,867. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated, and \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 26, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 8) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nDecember 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 22 and July, 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (Transcript (Tr.) \n14-15; GE 9). On September 18, 2009, Department Counsel announced he was ready \nto proceed on his case. On September 28, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to \nme. On October 1, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). On October 23, 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits \n(GE 1-6) (Tr. 29-30), and Applicant offered eight exhibits (Tr. 31-35; AE A-H). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 30), and AE A-H (Tr. 35-36). \nAdditionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 7-9). On \nNovember 2, 2009, I received the transcript. After her hearing, Applicant provided nine \nexhibits (AE I-Q), which were admitted into evidence without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d to \n1.i (GE 9). She established that that she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($45) (GE 9 at 3-4). \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.i and 1.n and 1.o pertained to delinquent student loans \n(GE 9 at 5-7).2 On March 23, 2009, she received an offer of a repayment schedule with \na $125 monthly payment starting on March 27, 2009, to address a balance owed on six \nstudent loan accounts of $8,302 (GE 9 at 6). A handwritten note indicated the medical \ndebt of $228 in SOR \u00b6 1.p was settled for $148 and paid using a money gram (GE 9 at \n9-10). A March 18, 2009, letter from the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r ($1,671), 1.s ($2,110), \nand 1.t ($563) indicated the debts were transferred to a different creditor (GE 9 at 19).  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6). In 1989, she \ngraduated from high school, and she has completed some credits towards her \nbachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 6, 36). She majored in business administration (Tr. 7).  She has \nnever been married and does not have any children (Tr. 7). Her September 26, 2008, \nsecurity clearance application describes her delinquent debts and two judgments (GE \n1). It does not list any other reportable incidents involving illegal drugs, alcohol, the \npolice, or courts (GE 1).    \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n2 Department Counsel conceded in his opening statement that there were duplications of her \nstudent loans and the actual number of student loans was seven totaling about $8,000, as opposed to the \n14 student loans listed on the SOR (Tr. 20, 89). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFinancial considerations \n \nThe SOR listed 20 delinquent debts, totaling $26,848. Six SOR debts are \nunrelated to student loans: \u00b6 1.a (apartment lease\u2014$1,222); \u00b6 1.b (apartment lease\u2014\n$4,315); \u00b6 1.c (pizza\u2014$45); \u00b6 1.k (telecommunications\u2014$356); \u00b6 1.l (judgment \nmedical\u2014$1,330); and \u00b6 1.p (medical\u2014$228). The remaining 14 SOR debts are all from \nstudent loans: \u00b6 1.d ($423); \u00b6 1.e ($579); \u00b6 1.f ($2,168); \u00b6 1.g ($1,717); \u00b6 1.h ($1,084); \u00b6 \n1.i ($1,648); \u00b6 1.j ($1,013); \u00b6 1.m ($2,720); \u00b6 1.n ($991); \u00b6 1.o ($1,061); \u00b6 1.q ($1,604); \n\u00b6 1.r ($1,671); \u00b6 1.s ($2,110); and \u00b6 1.t ($563) (Tr. 64-71).  \n \nAfter graduation from high school, Applicant worked at a drug store, for the \nairlines, at a bank, at a hotel, and in the travel industry (Tr. 37-38, 43-44). She was \nunemployed from July 2002 to March 2003 and from about November 2004 to August \n2005 and in 2007 for several months (Tr. 44-46; GE 1). After she lost her job in 2007 \nshe was financially devastated (Tr. 46). In July 2007, she was evicted and her car was \nrepossessed (Tr. 24, 28-29). She received her current employment in July 2007 as a \ntemporary employee, and then was hired as a full-time employee in September 2007 \n(Tr. 47-49). On February 27, 2009, she paid the $5,229 debt related to her repossessed \nvehicle (Tr. 47-48; GE 4 at 4).   \n \nFourteen SOR debts are related to Applicant\u2019s student loans: \u00b6 1.d ($423); \u00b6 1.e \n($579); \u00b6 1.f ($2,168); \u00b6 1.g ($1,717); \u00b6 1.h ($1,084); \u00b6 1.i ($1,648); \u00b6 1.j ($1,013); \u00b6 1.m \n($2,720); \u00b6 1.n ($991); \u00b6 1.o ($1,061); \u00b6 1.q ($1,604); \u00b6 1.r ($1,671); \u00b6 1.s ($2,110); and \n\u00b6 1.t ($563) (Tr. 64-71). Applicant attended college for about five semesters from 1989 \nto 1990 and then part time from 2001 to 2002 (Tr. 37-40). From 2001 to 2002, she \nreceived six student loans totaling $6,624 under the Stafford program in the amounts of: \n$458; $1,750; $1,333; $875; $1,333; and $875 (GE 9 at 11). The seventh student loan \nwas for about $2,000 and was evidently paid off in 2008 when her $2,600 federal tax \nrefund was diverted and applied to her delinquent student loans (Tr. 65-73, 84-85; GE 2 \nat 12-18; GE 9 at 11). She had difficulty locating the current creditor of her student loans \nbecause the loans were transferred to different collection companies (Tr. 25, 28-29). \nOver the last seven years, she made some payments and received some deferments \non her student loans (Tr. 40).  \n \nApplicant said she could not afford her student loan payments because her rent \nexpenses and car payments did not leave enough money to make payments on her \nstudent loan (Tr. 22, 28-29).  On March 23, 2009, she received a payoff figure of $8,302 \nfor all of her education loans with a $125 per month payment plan (AE J). She agreed to \nthis payment plan (AE B, J, K). On September 11, 2009, she received an updated \npayoff figure of $7,784 for her education loans (AE K). Her loan statement of October \n29, 2009, showed outstanding interest owed of $6, indicating her payment plan was \ncurrent (AE L at 2). \n \nApplicant promised to begin addressing her debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a (apartment \nlease\u2014$1,222) after she pays some of her other debts (Tr. 50-51).  The creditor offered \nto settle the debt for $800 (Tr. 51). She made a $25 payment on November 9, 2009 (AE \nP). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b (apartment lease\u2014$4,315) offered to \nsettle for a $3,600 lump sum (Tr. 52). The collection agency has obtained a judgment \nfor $2,398 for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Tr. 53; GE 2 at 27). \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c (pizza\u2014$45) resulted from a check returned for \ninsufficient funds (Tr. 54). She established that that she paid this debt (Tr. 54-55; GE 9 \nat 3-4).   \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($356) related to a telecommunications account (Tr. 55). \nShe has been paying $100 per month for about seven months, and had reduced the \ndebt from $900 to $200 (Tr. 55-56). \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l (judgment\u2014$1,330) relates to medical treatment Applicant \nreceived at an emergency room in 2006 (Tr. 57-59). She did not have medical \ninsurance (Tr. 57-59). Applicant has made two $125 payments to this creditor (Tr. 58). \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p (medical\u2014$228) relates to Applicant\u2019s visit to an \nemergency room (Tr. 61). She did not have medical insurance. Applicant paid this debt \n(Tr. 61-64; GE 9 at 10). \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross pay is $5,039 and her monthly net pay is $3,456 (AE \nM). Her monthly expenses total $2,424 (AE M, O). Her monthly rent is $1,099, and her \nrent is current (AE M, Q). Her debt payments include the following monthly payments: \n$125 for her student loan; $50 for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a; $157 for a debt consolidation \nloan; $487 for her car loan (Tr. 83); and $100 for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k (AE M). Her \nmonthly remainder after deducting her expenses and debt payments is $113 (AE M). \nHer car loan amount is $13,000 (Tr. 83; AE O). Applicant received financial counseling \nas documented by her personal finance management information sheet and personal \nfinancial statement (AE M, O).  \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s evaluations describe her as an exceptional employee with a positive, \ncan-do attitude (AE C). She treats others with respect, and accepts responsibility for her \nactions and decisions (AE C). She is diligent, responsible, competent, and professional \n(AE D). She shows flexibility, adaptability, appropriate initiative, and good judgment (AE \nD). \n \nA July 23, 2009, email from a customer lauded Applicant\u2019s hard work, \norganization skills, and attention to detail (AE H). A U.S. Navy Captain, who has known \nApplicant from June 2007 to September 2008, was impressed with Applicant\u2019s positive \nattitude, hard work, and desire to improve herself and her organization (AE F). He noted \nher increasing competence and value to her organization (AE F). He highly \nrecommended her for employment in administration (AE F).   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The Appeal Board has noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ncredit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is \ndocumented in her credit reports, her OPM interview, her responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories, her SOR response, and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to \nensure her creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \nconditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She did not resolve all of her delinquent \nSOR debts through payment, established payment plans or disputes.   \n \n AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) apply. Applicant had three periods of unemployment in \nthe period July 2002 to July 2007, with her most recent unemployment causing the most \nadverse financial impact. She was evicted from her apartment, her student loans \nbecame delinquent, and her vehicle was repossessed.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an \nApplicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after \ncircumstances outside an applicant\u2019s control cause delinquent debt.  In ISCR Case No. \n08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had a judgment against him in June 2001 \nfor $7,948; an IRS tax lien in January 2001 for $25,441 from tax years 1993 to 1997 \n(since released), and a state tax lien in September 1999 for $6,701 (since released). \nThese three delinquent debts established a history of financial problems, which included \nsignificant tax problems extending over eight years (1993 to 2001). Id. at 2. In 2007, the \napplicant\u2019s business faltered (the circumstance beyond his control), and he generated \nabout $21,000 in additional delinquent debt. Id. at 3-4. He paid six of his new debts, and \nthree debts totaling about $17,000 remain for resolution. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). He obtained financial counseling, developed a repayment \nplan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment plan. Id. at 3. The Appeal \nBoard at 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, \n \n.  .  .  what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncondition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in \nlight of his limited circumstances.    \n \nOnce Applicant returned to full-time employment in September 2007, she worked \ndiligently to pay their creditors.3 For example, she paid the $5,229 debt related to her \nrepossessed vehicle. She received financial counseling, and generated a budget. She \npaid two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.p). She established a payment plan for her \nconsolidated student loan, and paid her telecommunications debt from $900 down to \n$200 over the seven months prior to her hearing (SOR \u00b6 1.k). She paid $250 towards \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l and $25 to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She has not made any \npayments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b, who wants a $3,600 lump sum payment. She \nhas contacted all of her SOR creditors and knows what she must do to resolve her \ndebts. Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are clear \nindications that her financial problem is being resolved or is under control. She has \nestablished her financial responsibility.   \n \nApplicant does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) or 20(e). She did not \nestablish good faith4 in the resolution of her SOR debts because she did not adequately \ndemonstrate her efforts to pay her debts in the first year after she received her current \nemployment. She did not show sufficient adherence to her obligations. AG \u00b6 20(e) \napplies to the student loans that were duplicated. The record establishes that the seven \nstudent loans were duplicated in the SOR. In 2009, her student loans were consolidated \ninto one debt, which in September 2009 amounted to $7,784.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her debts resulted from unemployment, (two \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndebts were due to medical problems, and she did not have medical insurance). Her \nSOR listed 20 delinquent debts, totaling $26,848. She paid two debts. Fourteen of the \nSOR debts related to student loans, which were consolidated into a single payment \nplan, in which she owes $7,784. She has established payment plans on all of the other \nSOR debts, except for three debts, which total $6,867 (her total of $275 in payments \ntowards these three debts are not sufficient to establish a payment plan). I am confident \nshe will keep her promise to pay her delinquent debts5 because of her sufficient track \nrecord of financial progress shown over the last year.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \n  \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they do not warrant revocation of her security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay or resolve her just debts in accordance with contacts she \nsigned was not prudent or responsible. She has a history of financial problems. Her \n2008 and 2009 credit reports listed delinquent debts including two judgments.  \n      \n \n5 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional \nclearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

This footnote \ndoes not imply that this Applicant\u2019s clearance is conditional. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe rationale for granting or reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. \nShe was forthright and candid in her security clearance application, her responses to \nDOHA interrogatories, her responses to an OPM investigator, her SOR response, and \nat her hearing about her financial problems. Several problems beyond her control \nadversely affected her financial status. Her debts resulted from unemployment, (two \ndebts were due to medical problems, and she did not have medical insurance). \nFourteen of the SOR debts related to student loans, which were consolidated into a \nsingle payment plan, in which she owes $7,784. She paid two debts. She has \nestablished payment plans for all of her other SOR debts, except for three debts, which \ntotal $6,867 (her total of $275 in payments towards these three debts are not sufficient \nto establish a payment plan). I am confident she will keep her promise to pay her \ndelinquent debts. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person \nanalysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. She has achieved some important educational and \nemployment goals, demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. Her \nfinancial problems were caused by her unemployment, rather than by her misconduct or \nirresponsible spending. Before her employment problems, she did not have any \ndelinquent debts. Applicant is an intelligent person, and she understands how to budget \nand what she needs to do to establish and maintain her financial responsibility. Clearly, \nshe could have acted more aggressively to resolve her debts, after receiving \nemployment with a government contractor in September 2007. There is, however, \nsimply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt re-payment.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through \nher service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. A character witness \ndescribed Applicant as highly professional and diligent. Her evaluations document her \nsolid work performance and good character. She is an asset to her corporation. Her \nsecurity clearance application does not list any other reportable incidents involving \nillegal drugs, alcohol, the police, or courts.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors,\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. I conclude \nshe has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.t:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on July 19, 2008. \nOn May 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005. Applicant answered the SOR on in an undated document and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nJune 11, 2009. \nSeptember 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 26, 2009, DOHA issued a Supplemental SOR (captioned as an \namendment to the SOR), adding four allegations under Guideline E. Applicant \nresponded to the Supplemental SOR on June 29, 2009. Department Counsel was ready \nto proceed on July 1, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on July 7, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on July 8, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 3, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, but submitted no \ndocumentary evidence. I kept the record open until August 14, 2009, to allow him to \nsubmit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nF, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX A \nthrough F is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on August 11, 2009. The record closed on August 14, 2009.  \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s motions, without objection from Applicant, to \ncorrect SOR \u00b6 1.d by substituting \u201c$1,000\u201d for \u201c$1,00.00\u201d, to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c by \nsubstituting the name of Applicant\u2019s homeowners\u2019 association for a medical provider, \nand to change the amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e from $147 to $913 (Tr. 27-28, 103-06). \nThe amendments are handwritten on the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, \n1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, and Supplemental SOR \u00b6 2.d. His admissions in his answer and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor. He \nhas worked for his current employer since July 2008. According to his current \nsupervisor, he shows \u201cutmost respect\u201d to his co-workers and supervisors, is enthusiastic \nabout his duties, and has not had any disciplinary problems (AX D). \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from July 1979 to July 1982. He attended \ncollege part-time from about September 1985 to August 2003, and he received a \nbachelor of science degree (GX 1 at 2; GX 2 at 6; Tr. 44-45). He received a security \nclearance in December 1983, and it was revalidated in August 1990 and March 1994. \nHe was married in June 1992 and legally separated in April 2007. \n \n \nIn December 1999, Applicant applied for a federal job. He answered \u201cno\u201d to all \ndrug-use questions on his application. In June 2000, he was offered a job, conditioned \non a favorable background investigation. During a personal background interview on \nJuly 6, 2000, Applicant admitted using marijuana at his high school graduation in 1979, \nbut he denied any other drug use. At some time on or after July 6, 2000, he submitted a \nsupplement to his application, disclosing some unfavorable employment and financial \ninformation and a speeding ticket, but not disclosing any illegal drug use (GX 7 at 1). \nNeither the initial application nor the supplement to the application was offered in \n\n \n3 \n \n \nevidence, but Applicant\u2019s answers are described in a narrative report from the agency \nthat received them. On the same day as his interview, he submitted a urine sample for \ndrug testing. The sample tested positive for cocaine (GX 7 at 2). \n \nBy letter dated July 28, 2000, Applicant was notified that the agency\u2019s conditional \njob offer was rescinded because of the positive drug test (GX 7 at 1, 2, and 6). Applicant \ntestified he received a call asking if he had been to the dentist and informing him his \nurine sample was \u201cdirty,\u201d but he denied being told his urine was \u201cdirty\u201d with cocaine, and \nhe denied receiving a letter rescinding the job offer (Tr. 49, 80-81, 87-88).  \n \nAfter the federal job offer was rescinded, Applicant continued to work for a non-\ngovernment employer until August 2001. He was unemployed from August to December \n2001, and April 2006 to July 2008. During his periods of unemployment, he worked part-\ntime from home as a computer repairman and withdrew funds from his retirement \naccounts (GX 1 at 3; GX 2 at 6; Tr. 45).  \n \n \nDuring his unemployment from April 2006 to July 2008, Applicant accumulated \nnumerous delinquent debts.

On cross-\nexamination by Department Counsel, he testified as follows: \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL (DC): Okay. Now, [Applicant], you deny that \nyou have ever used cocaine? \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAPPLICANT: Yes. \n \nDC: You\u2019ve never used cocaine in your life? \n \nAPPLICANT: If so, I don\u2019t remember. It might have been a mistake, but \nnot in my knowledge. \n \nDC: What do you mean it might have been a mistake? \n \nAPPLICANT: If it was done, I \u2013 I guess you\u2019re talking ten years ago. I don\u2019t \nknow exactly what with parties \u2013 I know I had past drug tests before. \nAgain, that\u2019s why I mentioned that he asked me had I been to a dentist. \n \n.  .  . \n \nDC: You testified that it may have been possible that you were using \ncocaine ten years ago. \n \nAPPLICANT: It may have been, but I\u2019m not sure and that\u2019s why I really \nbasically put down that I denied because I don\u2019t really use drugs. \n \nDC: Are you unsure if you\u2019ve used \u2013 if you were using cocaine? \n \nAPPLICANT: At that time, I am not sure. Not sure. \n \nDC: When have you used cocaine? \n \nAPPLICANT: That I don\u2019t even know. \n \nDC: But, there has been a time when you have used cocaine? \n \nAPPLICANT: Again, that I don\u2019t remember. \n \nDC: But, it\u2019s a possibility? \n \nAPPLICANT: It may be possible, but I\u2019m not sure. \n \n.  .  . \n \nDC; Now, if there was a point that you may have used cocaine, where \nwould you have gotten it from: \n \nAPPLICANT: You asked me something that I don\u2019t remember. \n \n(Tr. 76-80.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel later asked Applicant if he had ever used any illegal drugs. \nHe admitted he used marijuana once at his high school graduation in 1979 (Tr. 85). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts, including four unsatisfied judgments. The \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises these three disqualifying conditions, shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s debts were numerous, persisted until \nrecently, and did not occur under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment were beyond his control. There is no evidence that his unemployment \nfrom April 2006 to July 2008 was related to his positive urinalysis in December 1999. He \nacted reasonably, attempting to earn money by self-employment, continuing to seek full-\ntime employment, and using his retirement funds to pay living expenses. I conclude AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant is not enrolled \nin a credit counseling program, but his financial problems are being resolved. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id.  \n \n \nApplicant has paid or negotiated repayment plans for all the debts alleged in the \nSOR. He is gainfully employed and financially stable. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nestablished. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Supplemental SOR alleges Applicant falsified an employment application for \nfederal employment and a supplement to that application by not disclosing his cocaine \nuse (Supplemental SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). It also alleges he falsified his responses during \nan interview on July 6, 2000, by denying any illegal drug involvement other than his \none-time marijuana use in 1979 (Supplemental SOR \u00b6 2.c), and he tested positive for \ncocaine during a pre-employment urinalysis on July 6, 2000 (Supplemental SOR \u00b6 \n2.d).The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is relevant to the falsifications alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. It is raised by: \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(b) is relevant to the falsification alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. It is raised by \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not \nprove an intentional falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the \nomission or misstatement. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying his employment application, his \nsupplement to his employment application, and his answers during a follow-up \ninterview. The record does not contain the employment application submitted by \nApplicant in December 1999. Thus, I cannot determine whether it asked whether he had \never illegally used a controlled substance, or whether it was similar to the SF 86 and \nasked if he had done so within the last seven years. The SOR does not allege that his \nfailure to disclose his marijuana use was a falsification. Instead, it alleges only that his \nfailure to disclose any cocaine use was a falsification. However, Applicant\u2019s positive \nurinalysis in July 2000 does not establish that he had used cocaine more than six \nmonths earlier when he submitted his application. In the absence of evidence showing \nthe scope of the questions on his employment application and the absence of evidence \nthat Applicant used cocaine before December 1999, I conclude that the falsification \nalleged in Supplemental SOR \u00b6 2.a is not established by substantial evidence. \n \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant was interviewed on July 6, 2000, the day of his \nurinalysis, and he submitted the supplement to his employment application on or after \nthe date of the interview. Although Applicant denied falsifying the supplement and his \nanswers during the interview, his denial is contradicted by the positive urinalysis and his \n\n \n9 \n \n \nevasive answers at the hearing about his cocaine use. The credibility of his hearing \ntestimony claiming lack of memory about a nine-year-old use of cocaine is undermined \nby his very specific memory of using marijuana at his high school graduation, more than \n20 years ago. His claim that he was never notified of his positive urinalysis is \nimplausible, contradicted by the government\u2019s documentary evidence, and not \npersuasive. I conclude that the allegations in Supplemental SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c are \nestablished by substantial evidence, and that the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(b) are raised. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to the illegal \ncocaine use alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s cocaine use shortly before his urinalysis in July 2000 and his repeated \nefforts to conceal his cocaine use are sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6 16(c) and 16(e). \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). It appears that Applicant may have volunteered the information \nabout his marijuana use during his interview in July 2000, but he made no efforts to \ncorrect his omissions and misleading answers regarding his cocaine use. To the \ncontrary, he persisted in his falsifications at the hearing. This mitigating condition is \nestablished for the omission of his marijuana use on his employment application, but not \nfor his repeated failures to disclose his cocaine use.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nIllegal drug use is a serious offense, but Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine was nine years ago \nand there is no evidence it has been repeated. His isolated use of cocaine is mitigated, \nbut his repeated falsifications to conceal it are not. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has \npersistently refused to acknowledge his cocaine use. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has done nothing \nto reduce his vulnerability. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He has served his country for many \nyears, both in and out of uniform. He has held a clearance for many years, apparently \nwithout incident. He has overcome the financial adversity triggered by a substantial \nperiod of unemployment. His lack of candor about his cocaine use, however, raises \ngrave doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his financial history and his isolated cocaine use, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his intentional concealment of his cocaine \nuse. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR and \nthe Supplemental SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nSOR Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSupplemental SOR Paragraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 23, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G.\nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \n\nThe Judge found that Applicant owes more than $200,000 in federal income taxes, as well\nas $1,380 in state income taxes and more than $10,000 in property taxes.  Although Applicant stated\nhe had payment plans in place, he did not provide proof he is paying any of these debts.  His\ntestimony about payment plans is not credible.  Applicant intentionally did not pay his federal, state,\nand property taxes for many years, up to tax year 2007.  He has numerous tax liens and consumer\ndebts that are not paid.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct was extensive, serious, and\nrepetitive, and that he has done very little to resolve his tax issues.  The Judge also concluded that\nApplicant has not changed his behavior and his motivation was greed.  The Judge concluded that\nApplicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial actions.\nApplicant argues that the Judge focused too much on his past and did not take into account\nthat he took a second job in an effort to correct his financial situation.  He stated that he has worked\nfor his employer since 1987 without any incidents of a security nature.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not\nestablish harmful error on the part of the Judge. \n The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nApplicant argues that the Judge was too focused on his \u201cpersonal life.\u201d  The Directive\npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\nGuidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at 3-4 (App.\nBd. Jul. 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to consideration of work\nperformance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul.\n29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nsafeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See Adams\nv. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of security violations does not bar\nor preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd.\nDec. 13, 2005).    \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She discussed the applicability of Guideline F mitigating conditions and\ncogently explained why there was insufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns, stressing the facts that Applicant deliberately sought to avoid numerous tax obligations\nover a number of years after being told by a tax advisor that he must pay his taxes, used retirement\nmoney to take his family on resort cruises, and failed to provide credible evidence that he has made\npayments on his tax delinquencies or other debts listed in the SOR.   \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\n\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nthe decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 30, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nThe Government withdrew the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.n \nand 1.p. The remaining allegations were renumbered and the change was made on the \nSOR to reflect allegations 1.a through 1.l.1 There were no objections. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, 1.i, 1.k and denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.j and 1.l. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old and has worked for a federal agency as a civilian \ngovernment employee since December 1987. He also works part-time as a security \nofficer for a federal contractor. He has worked for different companies in the same \ncapacity since 1992. He stated he holds a security clearance for his federal \nemployment, but his part-time employer required him to update his security clearance \napplication for employment.2  \n \n \nApplicant served in the Marines from 1983 to 1987, and was honorably \ndischarged. He married in 1990, and has a daughter who is 18 years old. He divorced in \n2000. He was separated from his wife when he had a child in 1995, with a different \nwoman. He stated he pays child support for this child, but not through a court order. At \npresent he pays $150 a month, but in the past he has paid $300 a month, depending on \nhis income. He married a different woman in 2002. He is still married, but he and his \nwife separated in 2007. He has no children with his wife.3  \n \n \nIn 2000, after reading a book, Applicant made a decision that he would not file or \npay his federal or state income taxes. The author of the book explained why taxes were \nunconstitutional and advised the reader to file an exemption form with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). Applicant asked his friend who is a tax advisor about the \nvalidity of the author\u2019s premise. He was advised by the tax advisor that the premise of \nthe book was \u201cfiction\u201d and he needed to pay his taxes. Applicant made a conscious \ndecision to have no money withheld from his pay for taxes, not to file the proper federal \ntax form, and not to pay his federal income taxes. He failed to file or pay his federal \n \n1 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e remain the same. SOR allegation \u00b6 1.k is changed to 1.f; SOR \u00b61.l is \nchanged to 1.g; SOR \u00b61.o is changed to 1.h; SOR \u00b61.q is changed to 1.i; SOR \u00b61.r is changed to 1.j; \nSOR \u00b61.s is changed to 1.k, and SOR \u00b61.t is changed to 1.l. \n \n2 Tr. 22-31. \n \n3 Tr. 107-108, 123-124, 133-139. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nincome taxes from 2000 to 2006. He explained he used the money to buy things he \nwanted. He paid $15,000 in cash to purchase a foreclosed home that needed repairs. \nHe spent $30,000 to repair the home. He stated he did it because of \u201cgreed\u201d and knew it \nwas wrong, but decided to continue because the IRS was not paying attention and did \nnot pursue him. He continued to send the IRS an affidavit stating he was exempt from \npaying federal income taxes. He contradicted himself during his hearing, claiming later \nthat he believed the affidavit was legitimate and he did not have to pay taxes. I did not \nfind his testimony credible. The IRS eventually began garnishing his federal wages. \nApplicant stated there was a \u201cmajor crackdown on frivolous filers.\u201d4 \n \nDuring this same period, Applicant also did not file or pay his state taxes or the \nproperty taxes on his house. He stated he also talked his wife into not filing her taxes. \nApplicant stated he was embarrassed that an Office of Personnel Management \ninvestigator interviewed him at his primary place of federal employment and considered \nit improper.5  \n \nIn 2006, Applicant stated he went to the IRS because his wages were being \ngarnished, and he attempted to resolve his tax issues. He believed 15% of his wages \nwere garnished, but did not provide any supporting documentation. He stated the IRS \nstopped garnishing his wages at one point because he was working reduced hours at \nthe federal agency and was not earning enough income. In July 2009, the IRS began \ngarnishing his wages from his second job. Applicant offered no documented proof that \nhis wages were or are being garnished. He provided pay stubs from both employers for \nFebruary 2009, but could not show a deduction for tax garnishment. He stated that in \n2006, he filed his overdue tax forms.6  \n \nApplicant explained he negotiated a payment plan with the IRS and was to pay \n$500 a month beginning in February 2009. He made one payment in February 2009, \nand then missed March, April, May, and June 2009 payments. He stated he then sent \ndocuments to the IRS in July 2009, whereby they were to begin deducting $1,100 a \nmonth from his pay. He stated he made three payments. He provided no documentation \nthat this occurred or that he has been making any payments.7 \n \nApplicant has state tax liens against him for failing to file and pay his state taxes \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c, $1,380) for 1999, 2000 and 2001. He stated he did not file for these years \nbecause he was going to get a refund and he had income withheld from his pay. I did \nnot find his testimony credible.8  \n \n4 Tr. 32-58, 61-74. \n \n5 Tr. 32-58. \n \n6 Tr. 40-58, 82-85, 129. \n \n7 Tr. 42-44. \n \n8 Tr. 75-81. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant has a federal tax lien for 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, $22,165).9 There is also a \ntax lien for 2003 ($28,000) that is not alleged and he disputes the amount.10 He stated \nhe is paying through garnishment the tax lien in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($65,040) for tax years \n2004, 2005 and 2006. No documentary evidence was provided.11  \n \n \nApplicant stated that in 2006, he changed his withholding tax on his pay. He did \nnot provide evidence that he took this action. Even if he did have money withheld, he \nstill owed taxes for that year (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $11,588).12 He admitted he was aware that not \nenough tax was being withheld, but did not change his withholdings for 2007. He stated \nhe filed his 2007 tax return on time, but failed to sign the forms. He did not file his 2008 \nincome tax return on time. He again failed to sign his 2008 form. He eventually signed \nboth 2007 and 2008 tax return forms, at the same time. It is unclear why he waited to \nsign his 2007 form until he signed his 2008 form.13  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he did not pay his property taxes. Judgments were entered \nagainst him by the city (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, $4,563 and $3,422, from tax years 2001 \nand 1999, respectively).14 Applicant offered an incomplete document to show a \npayment plan for his property taxes. The plan called for him to pay $384 a month \nbeginning in November 2008. He stated he made three or four payments of $200. He \nexplained that he would not pay his property taxes until the city threatened to take the \nproperty. When that would happen, he would pay a certain amount so they would cease \ntheir action. Once the city ceased its action, he would not pay until it threatened again. \nHe did this on more than one occasion. Applicant provided no proof of payments to the \ncity for his property taxes. He stated he withdrew $15,000 from his retirement account to \nmake the payments. He had to pay a tax penalty for the withdrawal, along with paying \nthe tax on the income. This increased his 2008 tax bill to approximately $16,000. It \nremains unpaid. He explained he used the money from his retirement account to pay \nother debts. Applicant admitted that he also used $2,000 from his retirement withdrawal \nto take his daughters on a vacation cruise. He has not paid his property taxes.15\n \n \n \n \n \n9 GE 13. \n \n10 GE 14. \n \n11 Tr. 40, 74-81. \n \n12 Tr. 83-86; GE 17. \n \n13 Tr. 58-61, 85-86. \n \n14 GE 24, 25. \n \n15 Tr. 40, 90-100, 112-113, 132, 141-143. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i for phone services ($1,622).16 \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($644) and i.l ($30) are credit card debts to the same \ncredit card company for different accounts. Applicant provided a document to show a \ndebt to the same named creditor was paid.17 However he admitted he had more than \none credit card with the same creditor. The document does not verify the account. The \ndebts alleged have different account numbers listed. He did not provide proof that the \ndebt paid is the same as the debts alleged.18  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($13,000) is for the deficiency on a loan on a vehicle that \nwas stolen. He stated he made arrangements with the creditor to pay one half of the \ndebt. He stated he has $100 a month taken automatically from his credit union account \nto pay the debt. He stated he has been paying this debt for two years. He provided a \ndocument to show he was setting up an automatic withdrawal beginning sometime in \nJanuary 2009. It does not state the amount. He did not provide proof that he has been \nmaking payments for two years or since January 2009.19 \n \nApplicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($91) for a civil judgment for contempt \nof court. He stated he paid the debt and would not have been issued a hand gun permit \nhad he not. He did not provide proof of payment.20 \n \nApplicant stated in 2008 he had approximately $7,000 to $8,000 in savings from \nworking two jobs. He did not use this money to pay his back taxes. He stated he paid off \na credit card that was not alleged in the SOR.21  \n \nApplicant believes he owes the IRS approximately $185,254 for past tax years \nand $16,000 for tax year 2008. He stated the IRS has advised him he owes $220,000. \n \nApplicant purchased a time share at a resort in 2005. He paid $200 a month and \nsold it back to the owner. He stated that in 2007, he and his wife would go to a resort \ncity for entertainment three times a month during that year. He estimated the cost of the \nmonthly trips was $600.22  \n \n \n16 Tr. 115. \n \n17 AE K. \n \n18 Tr. 115-117. \n \n19 Tr. 117-122; GE 2, AE H. \n \n20 Tr. 87-90; AE L. \n \n21 Tr. 110-111. \n \n22 Tr. 130-132, 132-134, 139-140. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant owes more than $200,000 in federal income taxes. He owes \napproximately $1,380 in state incomes taxes. He owes more than $10,000 in property \ntaxes. He stated he has payment plans. He did not provide proof he is paying any of \nthese debts. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible.23 \n \nI have considered the certificates of completion of training Applicant submitted.24 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n \n23 Tr. 127-129. \n \n24 AE M. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust. \n \nAppellant has a significant history of not meeting his financial obligations. He \nintentionally did not file or pay his federal, state, and property taxes for many years. He \nhas numerous tax liens and consumer debts that are not paid. I find there is sufficient \nevidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant knowingly failed to file \nand evaded paying his taxes for many years. He asked a tax advisor if the information \nfrom the book he read was accurate and he was specifically told \u201cno\u201d and that he must \npay his taxes. He chose to ignore the advice. He knew what he was doing was wrong \nand continued his conduct for years. He has been in contact with the IRS. He also has \nbeen in contact with state authorities. He has taken loans from his retirement account, \nbut used the money to pay other debts and to take his daughters on a vacation cruise. \nHe would also take his wife to a resort city several times a month for entertainment. \nApplicant disputes the amounts he owes to the IRS. He also disputes other debts. \nApplicant claims to have payment plans with the IRS and for his state taxes. However, \nhe has failed to make the payments he promised. He failed to pay his property taxes \nuntil the city threatened foreclosure. Applicant failed to provide credible evidence that he \npaid any of the remaining debts alleged in the SOR. He failed to provide a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of his past-due debts and to provide documented proof to \nsubstantiate his dispute. I find none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country as a \nMarine and was honorably discharged. He made an intentional and deliberate decision \nto evade paying his taxes even though he knew it was wrong. He continued to evade \npaying his federal, state, and property taxes for years. Applicant has done very little to \nresolve his tax issues. Even when provided with a payment plan, he failed to make \nconsistent payments and instead used some of his money for a vacation. Applicant\u2019s \nactions show consistently poor judgment and untrustworthy conduct. His testimony \nlacked candor and credibility. His conduct was extensive, serious, and repetitive, \nspanning many years and included not only federal income taxes, but also state income \ntaxes, and local property taxes. Even when offered the opportunity to begin a payment \nplan, he failed to follow through. In addition to his tax debts, he has other consumer \ndebts that are also unpaid. Applicant has not changed his behavior. His motivation was \ngreed. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline \nfor Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant two sets of interrogatories  to clarify or augment information about potentially\n1\ndisqualifying information in his background.

On June 19, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG)  for criminal conduct (Guideline J), financial considerations\n3\n(Guideline F), and personal conduct (Guideline E).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on December 18, 2009. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on\nDecember 30, 2009, I convened a hearing in this matter on January 20, 2010. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The Government presented eight exhibits (Gx. 1 - 8),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on January 28, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged that in December 1995, Applicant\nwas arrested, charged, and convicted of shoplifting, for which he was placed on 12\nmonths probation (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that in July 1996, he was arrested, charged, and\nconvicted of theft of U.S. government property, for which he spent one month in jail\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that in July 2002, he was charged with (1) purchase, possession,\nmanufacture, \ndistribution, \nor \nsale \nof \nmarijuana, \na \nfelony, \n(2)\nmanufacture/sell/dispense/distribute marijuana, a felony, (3) purchase, possession,\nmanufacture, distribution, or sale of cocaine, a felony, (4) possession of a firearm or\nknife during commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies, a felony, for which he\nwas placed on five years probation (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that in January 2004, he was arrested,\ncharged, and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, for which he spent 24\nhours in jail, was placed on 12 months probation, fined, and ordered to complete\ncommunity service (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that in April 2006 he was arrested and charged with\nviolating his probation, for which he was jailed for 10 days (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that, in\nMarch 2007, he was again arrested and charged with violating the terms of his\nprobation (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant admitted without explanation all of these allegations.\nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owes approximately\n$6,499 for 12 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.l). Applicant also admitted these\nallegations without explanation. The Government also cross-referenced the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 as a security concern under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Applicant also\nadmitted this allegation. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the\ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 32 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a computer\noperator and electronics technician. He has worked for his current employer since July\n2008. In 1995, after he graduated from high school, Applicant attended a vocational\ntraining school. He has never been married, but he has an 11-year-old daughter. He is\n\n3\nrequired to pay $256 each month to support this child. In September 2009, he resolved\na $2,500 child support arrearage. Applicant also pays another woman about $50 a week\nto support a 10-year-old boy whom the mother claims is Applicant\u2019s son.  Paternity has\nnot yet been verified, but Applicant anticipates he will be responsible for this child. By\nthe laws of the state where the child lives, the support payments will not be calculated\nretroactively to the child\u2019s date of birth, but will run from the date paternity is determined.\n(Gx. 1; Tr. 28 - 29, 42 - 43; 48 - 49)\nApplicant was arrested, charged, or convicted of criminal offenses at least six\ntimes between 1995 and 2007. On December 26, 1995, Applicant was arrested at a\nU.S. Army post exchange store. He was accused by the Provost Marshal of shoplifting\n$180 worth of video games. After he issued a written statement denying the charges,\nhis exchange privileges were revoked, his Armed Forces dependent\u2019s identification card\nwas confiscated, and he was released on his own recognizance. There is no information\nin the record that reflects a judicial disposition of this charge. (Tr. 30 - 31; Gx. 5)\nOn December 28, 1995, Applicant was again arrested for shoplifting. This time it\nwas by civilian police at a mall where he stole a jacket. On April 12, 1996, he was found\nguilty of theft by shoplifting, a misdemeanor, and placed on probation for 12 months.\n(Tr. 31 - 32; Gx. 4)\nIn about February 2002, Applicant began selling drugs as his sole means of\nsupport. He sold small amounts of marijuana and cocaine, and some of his customers\nwere soldiers from a nearby Army base. Applicant estimates he made about $300 a day\nselling illegal drugs. On July 8, 2002, based on the results of investigations by both\nArmy and civilian law enforcement, Applicant was arrested and charged with the drug\nand weapons offenses specified in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant was jailed pending trial. On\nNovember 15, 2002, he was sentenced to time served plus four months at a penal boot\ncamp. He also was placed on supervised probation for five years. His probation ended\non November 15, 2007. (Tr. 33 - 35; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 4; Gx. 6) \nOn January 23, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). On May 10, 2004, he was convicted of that charge, jailed for\n24 hours, assessed fines and court costs, ordered to complete 40 hours of community\nservice, and placed on probation for 12 months. (Tr. 36 - 37; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 4)\nOn April 26, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with violating the terms of\nhis probation from his 2002 drug conviction. Applicant had not paid the costs associated\nwith his probation. Despite subsequently making the required payment, he was jailed for\n10 days because of his 2004 DUI conviction and a positive urinalysis. Applicant was\nalso arrested and charged with probation violation in March 2007, because he again\nfailed to pay required probation costs. He was not jailed because he subsequently made\nthe required payment. (Tr. 37 - 39; Gx. 2; Gx. 4)\nAfter Applicant was released from probation in 2007, he moved to another state\nto be near his daughter. When he left, he incurred unpaid telephone, cable, and utility\nbills totaling about $2,000. He also left behind an unpaid rent obligation of $2,600.\nApplicant disputes that he owes this debt or that the amount cited is accurate; however,\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n4\nhe has no documentation to support his claim. When Applicant returned to the state\nwhere he now lives, he incurred another debt ($1,205) for unpaid rent after he broke his\nlease. Applicant testified that his stepfather is helping him resolve this debt, but did not\nsay how. Credit reports also reflect that Applicant owes about $685 for four unpaid\nmedical bills. Applicant does not know what these are for but does not contest their\nvalidity. (Tr. 26 - 27, 44 - 48; Gx. 7; Gx. 8)\nApplicant has not paid or otherwise resolved any of the debts attributed to him by\nthe credit reports obtained during his background investigation. In December 2009, he\nstarted consulting with a certified public accountant (CPA) who advised him to start a\nsavings account. That account will be used to negotiate with his creditors to settle his\npast-due debts. As of the hearing, Applicant had saved about $75. He lives paycheck to\npaycheck, but he is meeting his current monthly obligations. Applicant does not work\nfrom a budget, but he pays his bills as soon as he gets them. (Tr. 40 - 42)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct), AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline\nF - Financial Considerations), and AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n6\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nDespite Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR \u00b6 1.b, available information does not\nsupport that allegation. While Applicant admitted and discussed the December 1995\npost exchange shoplifting arrest, he testified that he did not think he was charged with\nstealing government property at that time. The FBI Report submitted as Gx. 4 shows\nonly that an individual with the same first and last name as Applicant, but with a different\nmiddle initial, was charged with theft of government property in the same state but in a\ndifferent city than Applicant\u2019s residence at the time. Unlike information supporting the\nother Guideline J allegations, the information about this arrest lacked any corroborating\ndetails and it was not discussed in his subject interview with a government investigator\nduring his background investigation. SOR \u00b6 1.b is resolved for the Applicant. \nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.f, the Government\u2019s information is sufficient to show\nthat Applicant was arrested, charged or convicted of drug-related felonies, a DUI, two\nshoplifting offenses, and two probation violations between 1995 and 2007. He has been\nincarcerated for his offenses at least three times, and until late 2007 was subject to\nimprisonment if he violated the terms of his probation. All of the information presented,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s admissions, raises a security concern that is expressed at AG \u00b6 30\nas follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nFurther, available information requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\n31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses); AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\n\n6\nformally prosecuted or convicted); and AG \u00b6 31(e) (violation of parole or probation, or\nfailure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program).\nI have also considered the potential applicability of the mitigating conditions listed\nunder AG \u00b6 32. Applicant insists that he has changed and that he will not engage in\ncriminal conduct in the future. However, he violated his probation at least three times.\nHis last violation occurred less than eight months before his probation was scheduled to\nend in 2007. I conclude the record does not support application of any of the mitigating\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 32. Applicant\u2019s arrest record ran from age 18 until age 25, and\nhis conduct has been supervised by the judicial system through age 30. Given the\nrecency of his probation, and his inability to complete that probation without incident, I\nspecifically conclude that the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) or AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement) do not apply.\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns about his criminal conduct.\nFinancial\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 2.a - 2.l; that is, that Applicant owes about $6,500 in delinquent personal debt\naccrued since late 2007. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are current because his debts\nalleged remain unpaid. Thus, the record requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s debts are due entirely to his decision to leave town after\nhis probation ended in November 2007. He has not demonstrated that he will be able to\npay or otherwise resolve his debts in the near future, and he is still living paycheck to\npaycheck. To his credit, he has started working with a CPA and has a plan of action.\nHowever, he has yet to establish a record of financial health that would indicate these\nissues will not recur. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his\nunpaid debts.\n\n7\nPersonal Conduct \nThe Government also cross-referenced the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 as\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E. As to his finances, failure to manage one\u2019s money\nor other personal affairs may also indicate a defect in overall judgment or reliability.\n(See AG \u00b6 18) Further, Applicant has a long history of disregarding laws against drug\ninvolvement, drinking and driving, and theft. He also has shown he is willing to risk\ngoing to jail by ignoring court orders regarding his probation. Such conduct also calls his\njudgment into question. (See AG \u00b6 30) All of the information presented, including\nApplicant\u2019s testimony, raises a security concern that is expressed at AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nHowever, none of the specific disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 16 apply.\nThe disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and AG \u00b6 16b) (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative) do not apply. Applicant has been candid about his arrests and finances\nand there has been no showing that he made any false statements in his SF 86 or\nduring the background investigation.\nThe disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct or concealment of\ninformation about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that\ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or\npressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group) and AG 16(f)\n(violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer\nas a condition of employment) do not apply to these facts and circumstances. The\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(g) (association with persons involved in criminal\nactivity) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s drug dealing endeavors because of the passage\nof time. \nFinally, I have not applied the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when\nconsidered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n8\n See footnote 9, supra. \n9\n8\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information) (emphasis added) or AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of:(1)\nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of\nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other government\nprotected information;(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;(4) evidence of significant\nmisuse of Government or other employer's time or resources) (emphasis added). \nThe established facts about his criminal conduct and finances are sufficient to\ndisqualify Applicant under Guidelines J and F, respectively. Because Applicant failed to\nmitigate the security concerns about those aspects of his background, he likewise failed\nto mitigate the overall concerns about his personal conduct articulated at AG \u00b6 15.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E, F, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 32\nyears old and presumed to be a mature adult. He has taken minimal steps to resolve his\nfinances and he has been steadily employed for almost two years. Applicant appears\nmotivated to avoid future adverse conduct and to improve his finances. However,\nabsent a reliable track record of conduct in both areas, which he has not established,\navailable positive information is not yet sufficient to overcome the adverse inferences\nabout his clearance suitability raised by the Government\u2019s information. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past\n8\nconduct and current circumstances shows he has failed to address satisfactorily the\ngovernment\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.  \n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance\nis denied.\n                                         \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJuly 14, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) on September 21, 2008.  On July 13, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 8, 2009.  She\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 13, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on January 25, 2010, and it was\nassigned to another Administrative Judge.  It was reassigned to the undersigned on\nMarch 1, 2010, and DOHA issued a notice of hearing that same day.  I convened the\n\n2\nhearing as scheduled on April 1, 2010.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1\nthrough 8, which were received without objection.  The Applicant testified on her own\nbehalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on April 8, 2010.  I granted the\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until May 3, 2010, to submit additional\nmatters.  On May 3, 2010, she submitted, through Department Counsel, Exhibit (AppX)\nA, which was received without objection. The record closed on May 4, 2010, the day her\nexhibit was forwarded to the undersigned by Department Counsel.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.k., and 1.m. of the SOR, with explanations.  She denied the\nfactual allegations in Subparagraphs 1.l. and 1.n. of the SOR. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nIn 2006, the Applicant\u2019s spouse was unemployed for about six months.  (TR at\npage 46 lines 2~20.)  This caused the Applicant\u2019s current financial difficulties.  (Id.)  As a\nresult, the SOR alleges 14 past due debts.\n1.a.~1.d., and 1.k.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor A in an amount totaling\nabout $1,017 for medical bills.  (GX 5 at pages 6 and 9, GX 6 at page 1, and GX 8 at\npage 1.)  The Applicant avers that she is making monthly payments of $50 to Creditor\nA\u2019s collection agency, but has provided no further documentation as to any payments\nmade.  (TR at page 30 line 4 to page 34 line 7, at page 41 line 19 to page 42 line 11,\nand see AppX A at page 2.)\n1.e.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor E in an amount of about $437 for cell\nphone service.  (GX 8 at page 2.)  The Applicant has done nothing to address this\nadmitted debt.  (TR at page 35 line 9 to page 36 line 1.)\n1.f.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor F in an amount of about $952 for\nsatellite televison.  (GX 8 at page 2.)  The Applicant has done nothing to address this\nadmitted debt.  (TR at page 36 lines 2~14.)\n1.g.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor G in an amount of about $47 for cable\ntelevison.  (GX 8 at page 2.)  The Applicant avers that she is current with this creditor,\nbut offers no documentation in this regard.  (TR at page 36 line 15 to page 37 line 21.)\n1.h.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor H in an amount of about $1,009 for\njewelry.  (GX 8 at page 2.)  The Applicant has done nothing to address this admitted\ndebt.  (TR at page 37 line 22 to page 38 line 6.)\n\n3\n1.i.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor I in an amount of about $9,538 for the\nrepossession of a motor vehicle.  (GX 8 at page 2.)  The Applicant has done nothing to\naddress this admitted debt.  (TR at page 40 line 14 to page 41 line 18.)\n1.j.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor J in an amount of about $3,596 for\nanother repossessed motor vehicle.  (GX 8 at page 2.)  The Applicant has done nothing\nto address this admitted debt.  (TR at page 38 line 7 to page 40 line 13.)\n1.l.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor L in an amount of about $678 for a\nmedical bill.  (GX 5 at page 8.)  The Applicant avers that she does not \u201cremember that\none,\u201d but offers nothing further in this regard.  (TR at page 42 lines 12~16.)\n1.m.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor M in an amount of about $65 for\nanother medical bill.  (GX 5 at page 8.)  The Applicant again avers that she does not\n\u201cremember\u201d this debt, but offers nothing further in this regard.  (TR at page 42 lines\n17~22.)\n1.n.  The Applicant has consistently denied the debt to Creditor N in the amount\nof about $200.  (TR at page 42 line 23 to page 43 line 2, and GX 4 at page 5.)  As this\nalleged debt does not appear on any of the Government\u2019s four credit reports, GX 5~8,\nthis allegation is found for the Applicant.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant has significant past due debts,\nwhich she has yet to address.\nI can find no countervailing Mitigation Condition that is applicable.  The Mitigating\nCondition found in Subparagraph 20(b) is applicable where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n\n5\nemployment, . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@  Here,\nthe Applicant\u2019s spouse was unemployed in 2006, but she has yet to seriously address\nher admitted past due debts.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Here, she has the unqualified support of\nthose with whom she works and her friends.  (AppX A the last 6 pages.)  However, the\nrecord evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from her Financial Considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",
