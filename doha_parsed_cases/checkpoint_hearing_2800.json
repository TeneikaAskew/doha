Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 8, 2020. \nOn July 15, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines G, H, and E. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 6, 2021, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on January 11, 2022. On January 19, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on January 25, 2022, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on May 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old welder-training specialist employed by defense \ncontractors since March 2015. He married in May 2019 and has three children, ages 17, \n16, and 2. He received a security clearance in April 2015. (FORM Item 8.) \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2008 to June 2017. When \nhe submitted an SCA in April 2015, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question asking if he had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances during the last seven years, and did not \ndisclose his marijuana use. (FORM Item 4 at 27.) He received a security clearance on a \ndate not reflected in the record, but before July 15, 2015, when he signed a nondisclosure \nagreement. (FORM Item 8.) He continued to use marijuana, as well as heroin and \ncocaine, while holding a security clearance. \nIn 2016, Applicant began using heroin, in addition to using cocaine regularly and \nmarijuana occasionally. In February 2017, Applicant self-admitted to a drug-treatment \nfacility and received inpatient treatment for alcohol and cocaine dependence. He was \nreleased in March 2017. The treatment recommendations upon discharge included \navoiding activities that involve alcohol or other drugs. He began attending Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings in early 2017. \nIn June 2017 Applicant intentionally overdosed on his prescribed Trazadone. After \nbeing treated in an emergency room for the overdose, he was readmitted into the drug-\ntreatment facility. In June and July 2017, he received inpatient treatment for cocaine \ndependence, cannabis abuse, and opioid abuse. \nIn July 2017, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated \n(DWI) and refusing a blood or breath test. In accordance with a plea agreement, he \npleaded guilty to refusing a blood or breath test, and the DWI charge was dismissed. He \nwas sentenced to a fine, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. From July \n2017 to September 2017, he received outpatient treatment for \u201calcohol use disorder \n(severe, dependence).\u201d Based on his arrest for DWI, his security clearance was \nsuspended in September 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DWI charge triggered an interview by a security investigator in March 2018. \nDuring the interview, Applicant told the investigator that he had not illegally used any \ndrugs or controlled substances during the past seven years. He denied misusing \nprescription drugs. He also told the investigator that he had not sought or been ordered \nto receive counseling or treatment for using drugs or controlled substances. (FORM Item \n5 at 6.) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted that his statements to the investigator were \nfalse. (FORM Item 2 at 2.) \nApplicant was fired by a defense contractor in January 2019 for coming to work \nunder the influence of alcohol and cocaine. He was hired by another defense contractor \nwith no significant period of unemployment. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he has been sober \nsince he was fired in January 2019. (FORM Item 5 at 14.) In his most recent SCA, he \nstated that he now attends AA meetings regularly and has a sponsor who has been sober \nfor 32 years. (FORM Item 3 at 37, 47.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was fired in January 2019 for coming to work under \nthe influence of alcohol and cocaine (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he received outpatient treatment \nfor \u201calcohol abuse disorder (severe, dependence)\u201d from July 2017 to September 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he was charged with DWI and refusing a blood or breath test in July \n2017, pleaded guilty to the test refusal, and was sentenced to a fine and suspension of \nhis driver\u2019s license for one year (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he received inpatient treatment for \nalcohol dependence from June to July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he received inpatient \ntreatment from February to March 2017 for conditions including alcohol dependence \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and. \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are also established by the evidence, \nbut they were not alleged in the SOR: \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol after a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder \nwas not alleged, it may not be an independent basis for denying Applicant a security \nclearance, but it may be considered to consider his credibility; to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether Applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered this unalleged conduct \nfor these limited purposes. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nAll three mitigating conditions are established. Applicant had only two alcohol-\nincidents, but they did not occur under such unusual circumstances that it is not likely to \nrecur. The first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on whether the \nconduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. \nThe determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nIf the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s first alcohol-related incident was in July 2017, and the last was in \nJanuary 2019, when he was fired for coming to work drunk. Two years and five months \nhave passed, which is a \u201csignificant period of time.\u201d He completed outpatient treatment \nfor an alcohol use disorder in September 2017, and he was diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent. He maintained his sobriety until he relapsed in January 2019. He has been \nattending AA meetings regularly since 2017 and has a sponsor. His sobriety since \nJanuary 2019, supported by regular AA participation, reflects an established pattern of \nabstinence from alcohol. \nGuideline G, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

His last \ndrug involvement was in January 2019, when he came to work under the influence of \ncocaine. Although his abstinence from drugs since January 2019 is a significant period of \ntime, it is not long enough to overcome security concerns raised by his 11 years of \nrepeated drug abuse. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant produced no evidence of disassociation \nfrom his drug-using associates and contacts, no evidence of a change of environment, \nand no statement of intent to abstain from drug involvement. \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not established. Applicant completed a drug-treatment program in \nMarch 2017, but he submitted no evidence of a favorable prognosis. His drug involvement \nrecurred in January 2019. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his marijuana use in his April 2015 SCA \nand his false statements to a security investigator about his illegal drug involvement and \ntreatment for drug involvement raise the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. There is no evidence that Applicant attempted to \ncorrect his SCA. He lied to an investigator in March 2018 and took no action to correct \nhis lies until he submitted his answer to the SOR in August 2021. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s false statements were arguably \n\u201cinfrequent,\u201d but they were not \u201cminor,\u201d because such statements strike at the heart of the \nsecurity clearance process. See ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) An \nintentionally false statement to a security investigator is a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \nAn applicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication \ninterferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). Applicant\u2019s false statements were recent because they \ninvolved the current adjudication of his application for a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines G, H, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol \nconsumption, but he has not mitigated the concerns raised by his drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drugs)  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

(SOR Answer) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of Pakistan. The behavior of the \nPakistani government presents a serious national security concern. The heightened-risk \nelement is easily satisfied. Given Applicant\u2019s family ties to Pakistan via his in-laws, the \nGovernment has established its case under Guideline B. The evidence of record \nestablishes security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and (e). Further review is \nnecessary. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position or having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \nPakistan\u2019s relationship with the United States, and the heightened risk it \npresents, place a very heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With \nthat said, Applicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and \ntrustworthy person. He was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He appears to \nhave cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance \nprocess and during his OPM interview. He made a good impression upon me during the \nhearing. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Pakistan via his in-laws. \nApplicant has a demonstrated record as a reliable employee. Given that his in-laws, \nwith whom he has very limited contact, are living in Pakistan, Applicant understands and \nis sensitive to the nature of the security concern based on foreign influence. Although \nthe family ties to Pakistan still count and cannot be dismissed out of hand, the strength \nof those ties are diminished given the facts and circumstances here. On balance, his \nties to the United States are far stronger than the family ties to Pakistan. \nGiven the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Pakistan government or his spouse or in-laws \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwho have Pakistani citizenship.

AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is \napplicable. \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are fully applicable, and AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation deteriorated when he was in college and used his credit \ncards for daily expenses while helping support his parents. He also was unemployed for \na short time before beginning his current job. He initiated contact with a DCC in January \n2021 and signed a contract in March 2021, well before his October 2021 hearing. He \nhad paid the DCC their $2,575 fee in five $495 monthly payments between March 2021 \nand July 2021. Applicant also had completed financial counseling in March 2021. He \nmoved out of state to reduce his living expenses. Both he and his wife are using their \nincome to pay off creditors. Applicant has demonstrated through his actions that he is \ndetermined to overcome his the indebtedness he incurred while in college. He knows \nthat regaining financial responsibility is essential to qualify for a security clearance and \nhas taken reasonable steps to resolve his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s plan to enter into an agreement with a DCC to settle and/or pay off \nhis debts is deliberate and measured. Given the financial resources available to the \nApplicant, it appears that he is doing his level best to pay off the creditors.

All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations 32) and quotations \nomitted). \nWhen considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view his \ncorrective action to be reasonable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guidelines B and F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, \nfurther comments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and F and the whole-person \nanalysis support a favorable decision. To review, Applicant is a 36-year-old senior \nproject manager who has been employed by a defense contractor since July 2021. In \n2001, at age 15, he immigrated to the United States along with his mother and three \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsisters from Pakistan. He spent a significant portion of his formative years in the United \nStates where he graduated from high school, college, and graduate school. Applicant \nand his entire immediate family are all naturalized U.S. citizens. They have no \nconnection with or are associated with the Pakistani government. For the last 20 years, \nthey have made their life in the United States. \nIn 2018, Applicant married his wife, then a Pakistani citizen and resident. She \nimmigrated to the United States in 2021 after obtaining her \u201cgreen card\u201d to join Applicant \nin the United States. She is currently employed at a dental clinic in a non-dentist \ncapacity while studying for her state dental certification examination. Applicant has little \nto no contact with his in-laws in Pakistan. Since he was 15 years old, his entire life has \nbeen in the United States. Based on the deep-seated connections Applicant has \ndeveloped in the United States in past 20 years, he can be expected to resolve any \nconflicts in favor of the United States. \nApplicant fell into debt as a result of using his credit cards to augment his \nincome while in college. He did not have the funds to cover all of his expenses and \nsupport his parents. In lieu of working while in college, he chose to focus on completing \nhis education in the shortest possible time so that he could enter the work force and \nearn income. He also had a brief period of unemployment before beginning his current \njob. Applicant recognized the importance of regaining financial responsibility, not only \nfor purposes of obtaining a clearance, but also going forward as a productive member of \nsociety. He recently married and took on the responsibility of being a husband and \nhopes to start a family. \nApplicant has accepted responsibility for his debts. Well before his October 2021 \nhearing, he contacted a DCC in January 2021, and in March 2021 signed a contract \nwith the DCC. He completed financial counseling and made all of his payments to the \nDCC before his hearing. His approach to resolving his debts is measured and \nresponsible. I was impressed with his demeanor and willingness to go so far as to move \nto a different state to reduce his living expenses. It is clear from Applicant\u2019s actions that \nhe is determined to regain financial responsibility and going forward to avoid repeating \nhis past financial missteps. He has a job that will provide him with upward mobility and \nhis spouse is about to launch her professional career as a dentist. He understands what \nhe needs to do to maintain financial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayment. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n   Subparagraph 1.a: \n  Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.j: \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 27 years old and currently married. He has a son, age six, out of wedlock. He pays child support for his son, which is taken directly from his paycheck. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in September 2012, and he received an honorable discharge from active duty in September 2016. He is a member of the Marine Corps Inactive Reserve to the present time. Since July 2019, Applicant is employed as a \u201cCHUB1\u201d unpack operator in a chemical handling building for a federal contractor. His net monthly salary is approximately $4,200. His employer requires him to be eligible for a position of trust to perform specific employment duties. (Tr. 15-16, 41-42; GE 1) Applicant stated that he suffered financial problems when he was laid off from employment in 2017. His spouse lost her school employment position due to the pandemic. In January 2022, he tested positive for COVID. He was sick and unable to work for approximately one month. He used 40 hours of his vacation and 16 hours of sick leave while he was out from work. At that time, he and his spouse had about $10,000 in their savings account, which they depleted while he was unable to receive a paycheck for the remainder of the month. They also experienced other unexpected family emergencies. At the hearing, he said it was his personal priority to save $10,000 again in his savings",

He denied the majority of the SOR allegations, \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 2.a, and 2.b., and he admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.e. Processing of the case was \ndelayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 11, 2021, the case was assigned to \nme. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the hearing notice on \nFebruary 17, 2022, setting the hearing for March 1, 2022. The hearing proceeded as \nscheduled using the Microsoft Teams video-teleconferencing system. \nDepartment Counsel submitted five documents, which I admitted into evidence \nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, without objection. Applicant did not submit \nany documentation, and I held the record open until March 15, 2022, in the event either \nparty wanted to supplement the record with additional documentation. No additional \ndocumentation was submitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, \n2022, and the record closed on March 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 27 years old and currently married. He has a son, age six, out of \nwedlock. He pays child support for his son, which is taken directly from his paycheck. \nHe enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in September 2012, and he received an honorable \ndischarge from active duty in September 2016. He is a member of the Marine Corps \nInactive Reserve to the present time. Since July 2019, Applicant is employed as a \n\u201cCHUB1\u201d unpack operator in a chemical handling building for a federal contractor. His \nnet monthly salary is approximately $4,200. His employer requires him to be eligible for \na position of trust to perform specific employment duties. (Tr. 15-16, 41-42; GE 1) \nApplicant stated that he suffered financial problems when he was laid off from \nemployment in 2017. His spouse lost her school employment position due to the \npandemic. In January 2022, he tested positive for COVID. He was sick and unable to \nwork for approximately one month. He used 40 hours of his vacation and 16 hours of \nsick leave while he was out from work. At that time, he and his spouse had about \n$10,000 in their savings account, which they depleted while he was unable to receive a \npaycheck for the remainder of the month. They also experienced other unexpected \nfamily emergencies. At the hearing, he said it was his personal priority to save $10,000 \nagain in his savings account before he will address paying off other debts. (Tr. 36-37, \n43-47; GE 2) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F five delinquent debts which totaled \napproximately $31,116. The credit reports in the record corroborate the delinquent \naccounts. The current status of these debts is as follows: (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) \n1 Applicant was uncertain what the acronym \u201cCHUB\u201d stood for when asked during his hearing.

Applicant denied this debt in his SOR response. During the \nhearing, he testified that he discovered two months ago after placing a phone call to the \ncreditor, that this account was for his unpaid medical bills. He mistakenly believed that \nonce he was discharged from the military, he would be covered by TRICARE medical \ninsurance indefinitely. He later learned that he only carried medical insurance for \napproximately six months after his 2016 discharge, but he continued to receive medical \ntreatment from the VA for one or two years thereafter. He admitted that he was \nresponsible for this debt. He has never made any payments on this account. He intends \nto set-up a payment plan in the near future. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 16-20, 37-38; \nSOR response) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege two VA Debt Management accounts totaling $982 that \nhave been referred for collection. Applicant denied these debts in his SOR response, \nbut during the hearing, he admitted responsibility for these accounts. He also reiterated \nthat he had not made any payments on these accounts for unpaid medical services. He \nintends to set-up payment plans in the near future. These debts remain unresolved. (Tr. \n20, 37-38; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $26,014 charged-off account with Wells Fargo. Applicant \nadmitted this debt in his SOR response, and at the hearing he stated that this account \nwas fully resolved. In 2016, he purchased a Jeep and financed it through Wells Fargo. \nSince he voluntarily returned the vehicle in 2018, he no longer owed any deficiency \nbalance on this account. Applicant claimed that he had called the creditor a year ago \nand was informed that he did not owe any deficiency balance. Department Counsel \nasked him if he could provide documentation that substantiated his claim, and Applicant \nagreed to provide documentation post-hearing. Applicant did not provide any supporting \ndocumentation by March 15, 2022, and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 20-23, 38-42; SOR \nresponse) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $198 T-Mobile account referred for collection. Applicant \nadmitted this debt and testified at the hearing that he had not made any payments on \nthis account, but he intended to pay the account in full with his upcoming paycheck. \nDepartment Counsel requested Applicant provide documentation that the account was \npaid in full during the two-week period the record was held open. Applicant did not \nprovide any supporting documentation by March 15, 2022, and this debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 23-24; SOR response) \nApplicant admitted that after paying all of his monthly expenses on a monthly net \nincome of about $4,200, he had about $1,000 left over at the end of the month. He \nstated that he uses some of that money to make an extra payment on his vehicle loan \nby doubling his current car payment of $300 to $600. He has doubled his car payment \non six or seven occasions in 2021 in an effort to raise his credit rating. When questioned \nby Department Counsel for an explanation as to why he did not use any of the $1,000 \nmonthly remainder to pay his delinquent accounts, Applicant stated that he just never \nconsidered these debts when he is paying his bills.

He stated that this year he should get \na tax refund of about $6,800, which he intends to use to pay his delinquent debts and \nplace any remainder into his savings account. When questioned about the previous tax \nyear, he admitted that he received a 2020 tax refund in 2021 for about the same \namount. The SOR was issued in January 2021, and he admitted that he did not apply \nany of his 2020 tax refund to make payments on any of his outstanding debts. (Tr. 29-\n37, 42-49) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his July 2019 SCA when he failed to \ndisclose adverse financial information, such as whether he had defaulted on any loans, \nhad any repossessions, or had any accounts past-due or referred for collection within \nthe last seven years. (\u00b6 2.a) At the hearing Applicant testified that when he filled out the \nSCA he was not aware that he was delinquent with the VA for unpaid medical services \nor past due with his T-Mobile account. He did admit, however, that he was aware that \nhis Jeep had been repossessed in 2018 for non-payment. He knew he had financial \nissues after he was laid-off from work in 2017, which was stressful, and he dealt with \nthat stress by ignoring his financial obligations. He stated, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not going to look and \nsee if I do have any debts.\u201d (Tr. 25-28, 38-41, 47-48; SOR response; GE 1) \nThe second SOR allegation under Guideline E alleged that during Applicant\u2019s \nbackground interview on August 19, 2019, he falsified material facts after he denied that \nhe had any delinquent accounts or repossessions when questioned by the investigator.\n(\u00b6 2.b) Applicant was then confronted with information about his repossessed vehicle\nand the outstanding balance on his loan. Applicant then explained to the investigator\nthat he had been delinquent on the car loan for approximately one year and that the\nJeep was eventually repossessed in 2018. He contacted the creditor in July 2019 to set-\nup a monthly payment plan of $220 to pay the outstanding deficiency balance of\n$17,775. He had made two monthly installments; one payment last month and his\nsecond payment the same month of his interview. Applicant also discussed his other\ndelinquent accounts which were attributed to his 2017 lay-off from employment. His\n2019 statement to the investigator acknowledging a deficiency balance on his\nrepossessed Jeep is inconsistent with his testimony during the hearing.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.2 Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.3 An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government.4 An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n3 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n4 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaled approximately \n$31,116. The Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 19(a) (an inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \nconditions is required. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder  such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to establish a clear plan \nto resolve his financial issues and he has not taken any significant actions to implement \na repayment plan. He made promises to pay delinquent debts in the future, for example, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith his next paycheck, or with the proceeds of his 2021 tax refund, however, there is \nno evidence in the record that he has made good on those promises. He received the \nSOR in January 2021, and even though he received a tax refund of nearly $7,000 in \n2021, he did not apply any of that money to pay or satisfy his delinquent debts. \nApplicant admitted he has about $1,000 left over at the end of each month after \npaying his monthly expenses, but he has not made any effort to set-up payment plans \nwith creditors, or resolve any of his delinquent accounts. He failed to meet his burden of \nsatisfactorily explaining why he was unable to make greater progress resolving his \ndelinquent debts. He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, and his financial obligations alleged in the SOR remain unpaid and \nunresolved. His delinquent finances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \u2026 \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material information \non his July 2019 SCA, and during his background interview in August 2019. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct.

At the hearing, Applicant \nstated that he had not been aware of the delinquent accounts, but he was aware that \nhis car had been repossessed due to non-payment. During his August 2019 background \ninterview, he was asked by the investigator if he had any delinquent accounts, defaulted \nloans, or if he ever had anything repossessed within the last seven years. Applicant \ndenied all of these inquiries. When he was confronted with adverse information taken \nfrom his credit report, Applicant provided detailed explanations about several delinquent \naccounts, and how he fell behind on his bills after he was laid-off by his employer in \n2017. He admitted that he had just set-up a monthly payment plan for his vehicle that \nwas repossessed in 2018 with a deficiency balance of $17,775. He told the investigator \nthat he made his first payment the month he had completed the SCA, and a second \npayment the same month as his background interview. \nAt the hearing, Applicant provided inconsistent testimony about his repossessed \nJeep. He stated that since he voluntarily returned the vehicle, he no longer owed any \ndeficiency balance. When asked how he came to this conclusion, Applicant stated that \nhe had called the creditor a year ago, and they told him he did not owe any money. \nApplicant was given the opportunity to supplement the record with supporting \ndocumentation. He did not provide any documents while the record was held open for \ntwo weeks. In light of the omissions on his SCA and his inconsistent statements during \nthe security clearance investigation and hearing, I find that Applicant is not a credible \nwitness. Overall, Applicant\u2019s failure to be honest and candid casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to take responsible action to resolve his financial delinquencies \nafter it was brought to his attention in August 2019 during his background interview, and \nin January 2021, when the SOR was issued. He did not establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, and his financial obligations remain unpaid and \nunresolved. Applicant\u2019s failure to be honest and candid about his financial issues casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. After evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na public trust position. Eligibility for public trust position is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old. He is married for the second time. His first marriage \nwas from 1984 until 2011 when he divorced. He married the second time in 2015. He \nhas two adult children from his first marriage and two adult stepchildren from his \nsecond. He currently works for a defense contractor for whom he has worked since \n2006. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. He was first granted a security \nclearance 2012. In 2019, he was denied sensitive compartmented information (SCI) \naccess by an other government agency (OGA) after two days of polygraph interviews \nand tests in April 2017. The information from the OGA led to the issuance of the SOR \nhere. (Tr. 26-27; GE 3-5) \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged that Applicant, from 1985 to February 2017, \non at least nine occasions, paid women for sexual acts, including after being granted a \nsecurity clearance in 2012. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) This allegation was also cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) It was also alleged under Guideline E that Applicant provided \nmaterial false information during an interview with the OGA on April 25, 2017, by \ndenying he paid for sexual acts during a recent trip to another state. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nIn approximately 2017, Applicant was being considered by the OGA for access to \nSCI information. As a requirement for that access, Applicant was required to undergo \ninterviews and polygraph examinations. These interviews and polygraph examinations \nwith agents from the OGA took place on April 25-26, 2017. As a result of the information \ncompiled by the OGA from the interviews, Applicant was initially denied access to SCI in \nMarch 2018, and that decision was finalized in March 2019. The OGA\u2019s investigative \nreport and the SCI denial decisions are contained in GE 5. Applicant participated in \ninterviews with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) agents in August 2019 and \nApril 2020, as part of his background investigation for this clearance action. \nSummarized reports were prepared of those interviews. In January 2021, Applicant was \ngiven the opportunity to review the summarized statements and make corrections \nand/or additions to them, which he did. Those summarized OPM statements and \nApplicant\u2019s responses are contained in GE 4.

Several \npieces of evidence require examination in detail and are set forth below.   \nApplicant\u2019s Hearing Testimony \nApplicant admitted that when he was in his 20s (mid-1980s) he went to two \nmodeling studios in the state where he was living and received manual stimulation from \nfemales on both occasions. He admitted these acts during his April 25, 2017 polygraph \ninterview. He also admitted that a third similar incident happened in another state. He \nwas not arrested for these acts and he did not hold a security clearance at the time. He \nstated that when he disclosed this information to the OGA agents in April 2017, they told \nhim he was failing the polygraph because of his breathing. (Tr. 24-26) \nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his first wife was finalized in November 2011. In 2012, \nhe went to Germany on a work trip. He had relatives there so he also incorporated \nsome personal time during that trip. He was feeling lonely because of his recent divorce \nso he visited a brothel on four occasions while in Germany. He believed prostitution was \nlegal in Germany at that time. He had never been to a brothel before then and has not \nbeen back to one. He held a security clearance at the time. He stated that he was not \nbriefed or instructed on disclosing this information to a security officer since he believed \nhis actions were legal. He disclosed this foreign travel on his 2013 security clearance \napplication (SCA). (Tr. 26-29; GE 2, p. 64) \nApplicant regularly exercised and to relieve muscle pain from his workouts he \nhas also regularly got massages afterwards. He has probably had approximately 60 \nmassages over the years. At one time he had a membership to a national massage \nchain. Sometime after 2013, he sought a massage after a workout and went to a \nmassage parlor. While being massaged, the masseuse began manually stimulating his \ngenitals. Applicant did not seek out this treatment. He did not say yes to this stimulation, \nbut he also did not fight her off. No pay was offered or solicited for this \u201cservice.\u201d He did \npay the massage fee and provided a tip, which is customary in this service business. \nApplicant never returned to this massage parlor. (Tr. 29-31; SOR Answer) \nThe second occasion where Applicant experienced an unsolicited sexual \nadvance by a masseuse occurred in late 2016 or early 2017. Applicant was in a \ndifferent state and was waiting to pick up his wife at the airport. He had several hours \nbefore she arrived and decided to get a massage. He randomly selected a massage \nparlor and went there for a massage. While getting the massage, the masseuse \ngrabbed his genitals and asked him if he liked it, to which he responded \u201cno.\u201d She then \nexposed her breasts to him, which caused him to ejaculate. He did not solicit this action \nby the masseuse. He paid for the massage and left a customary tip. He later picked up \nhis wife at the airport and told her what happened at the massage parlor. Since this last \nincident, he has never been back to a massage parlor. He now treats his workout \nmuscle fatigue with regular trips to a chiropractor.

He took the polygraph because passing it would allow him to \nbe involved in new roles for the company. He fully cooperated with the polygraphers \nand when they questioned his truthfulness, he told them about every embarrassing \nincident in his past. This was the first time he took a polygraph. Ironically, after the \npolygraph and the denial of his SCI access by the OGA, he continued to support that \nagency on other projects as recently as a week before this hearing. (Tr. 35-36, 40; SOR \nAnswer) \nApplicant has continued to do classified work for his company in the intervening \nfive years since the polygraph test. He continues to have access to top secret material. \nHe has been his company\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) for the past five years and was \nmost recently appointed by his CEO in 2020. He is also a member of the company\u2019s \ninsider threat team. (Tr. 40-41; AE A-C) \n2017 Report of Polygraph Interviews of Applicant on April 25-26, 2017 (GE5) \nIt is unclear if the report that is reflected in GE 5 (pp.1-24) is the complete report \nof Applicant\u2019s investigation by the OGA. The handwritten page numbers appear to have \nbeen made by Department Counsel and not by the author(s) of the report. The author(s) \nof the report are not identified. No person identified with creating the report was called \nas a witness by the Government at hearing. \nThe report described an interview with Applicant on April 25, 2017. Under a topic \nheading of \u201cCrime,\u201d the report indicated that in 1985 to 1990, Applicant stated that he \nwas with two females on two different occasions at two different massage parlors where \nhe paid $50 for manual stimulation. The report does not describe or cite to what laws \nwere violated on these occasions. In his response to the OGA\u2019s SCI denial action, and \nwhile admitting to the conduct, Applicant disputed that these acts occurred at massage \nparlors, but rather at nude modeling establishments, otherwise known as strip-clubs. \nThe report also described a 1990 trip to a nude modeling place where Applicant paid for \nand received manual stimulation. He admitted this conduct in his response to the denial \naction. (GE 5, pp. 20, (Applicant\u2019s April 2018, response to the OGA\u2019s clearance action \ncomprises pp.29-42 of GE 5)) \nThe report further described the following incidents purportedly disclosed by \nApplicant during his post-polygraph interview on April 25, 2017: \nFrom 2011 to 2015, on four different occasions at four different brothels, S \n(subject) paid 50 Euros for vaginal and oral intercourse with nude females \nappearing in their 20s to 40s. (Incident 1) \nIn 2015, S was in [State] and went to a massage parlor.

S clarified that he \ntraveled to [an out of state city] for work related purposes in February \n2017 and he went to a local massage parlor for a massage in his free time \nknowing that the massage could end in some form of sexual gratification. \nTowards the end of the massage, the masseuse, who was a 30 to 40 year \nold female of Asian decent [sic], started to brush his penis with her hand \nand arm. She asked S if he liked it and he responded \u201cyes.\u201d The \nmasseuse then started \u201cflashing\u201d or showing her chest to him which made \nS become sexually aroused.

(Incident 2) \nIn 2016, S was in [another state] and went with his wife to get a massage. \nDuring the massage S became aroused and the masseuse grabbed S\u2019s \npenis and lifted her shirt. S reported that he felt uncomfortable and told her \nto stop. S paid $60 for the massage. (Incident 3)(GE 5, p. 20) \nRegarding Incident 1 above, Applicant\u2019s April 2018 clearance denial response \nadmitted that he visited the same German brothel four times in 2012. He did not visit \nmultiple brothels over multiple years as described in the report. He described why he \nvisited the brothel (recent divorce), that he believed his actions were lawful because \nbrothels are legal in Germany, and that he has never been back to a brothel since those \nactions in 2012. He also was unaware of any security reporting requirement because of \nhis actions. (GE 5, pp. 29-30) \nRegarding Incidents 2 and 3 above, Applicant\u2019s April 2018 clearance denial \nresponse admitted that he visited massage parlors in 2013, not 2015, as described in \nthe report and in 2016. He stated that he has visited massage parlors 50-60 times over \nthe years to help him with severe leg and back pain. He did not frequent these places \nfor the purpose of receiving \u201cpaid or unpaid sexual favors.\u201d He always paid the massage \nfee and the customary tip. (GE 5, p. 30) \nThe report described the follow-up questioning purportedly disclosed by \nApplicant during his pre-polygraph interview on April 26, 2017: \nS previously reported that he went with his wife to get a massage during \nthis incident, however, he stated during this interview that he did not go \nwith his wife. He did, however, tell his wife that the masseuse touched his \npenis, but that nothing else happened because he did not want to hurt her \nin anyway\u2026. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s hearing cross examination by Department Counsel, Applicant \ndenied that he told the polygraphers that he went to the massage parlors for sexual \ngratification during his April 26, 2017 interview. Applicant believes the polygrapher \nskewed his answer when Applicant responded to the repeated question of whether he \nwas thinking about being sexually gratified when he went to the massage parlor by \nmaybe subconsciously wanting it to happen. Applicant also denied that he told the \npolygrapher that he liked what was happening when asked by the masseuse. He also \ndenied his purported statement that he did not resist the touching. (Tr. 50-53) \nApplicant\u2019s Background Investigation Interview Conducted in April 2020 and \nApplicant\u2019s Correction, Additions, and Deletions to that Interview submitted in \nJanuary 2021 (GE 4) \nDuring his April 2020 background interview, Applicant was asked about the \nincidents that led to his SCI access denial by the OGA. The interviewer summarized \nthat information as follows: \nIn 2017, Subject was in [another city and state] and went to a local \n[massage chain] in order to get a massage for pain related to working out. \nDuring the massage, Subject became aroused and the masseuse [sic] \nwhile he was falling asleep. The masseuse grabbed his genitals and \nbegan to lift her shirt. Subject told her to stop. Subject admitted that he \nsubconsciously might have wanted her to continue but he felt very \nuncomfortable. Subject paid for the massage and left immediately. He \nnever returned to that massage parlor. Immediately following, Subject told \nhis wife about this incident because she was the one who recommended \nthat he go to [massage chain]. However, she was not present as \npreviously indicated in past interviews. When asked about this incident- \nduring \nthe \npolygraph, \nhe \nadmitted \nduring \nthe \npolygraph \nthat \nsubconsciously [sic] might have wanted manual stimulation to be \nperformed, but consciously he did not and to him the question did not \nmake sense. He was asked by the polygrapher if he had noticed a sign on \nthe wall that said it was illegal and/or did he report it to anyone in the \nestablishment or to the police, to which he did not. (GE 4, p. 9 (pagination \nat bottom right of each page)) \nApplicant made several additions and corrections to the above summarized \ninformation when he was first allowed to review it in January 2021. Those corrections \nare stated verbatim below: \nI did not state \u201c[name of massage chain]\u201d but rather had told them at one \ntime I had maintained a membership at [massage chain] over the years. I \nvolunteered that information to show that I had gotten countless massages \nover the years that did not involve an incident. I was on travel and do not \nremember the name of the massage parlor I visited in 2017. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nI never stated that my wife was present at any time during any of the \nevents listed in the interviews. My wife was flying into [the state] that day \nand I was on my way to pick her up at the airport. In my interview, I stated \nthat I told my wife what happened at the massage parlor (and not that she \nwas present at the parlor). I have reiterated this fact several times and I \nam not sure why the topic keeps coming up as I have provided the same \ncorrection every time. \nAfter I told the polygrapher that I did not go to the parlor with the intent of \nreceiving manual stimulation, and that I told her no and to stop. [sic] He \nthen repeatedly asked me if I was thinking it. I then said, \u201cmaybe \nsubconsciously?\u201d He smiled at me and said yes. I then mentioned the fact \nthat I saw the sign at the entrance when I came into the facility so \nobviously thinking it subconsciously seemed out of place. This is when the \npolygrapher became visibly and verbally angry with me. (GE 4, p. 12) \nApplicant explained his answers to the polygraphers by pointing out that the \npolygraphers repeatedly insinuated that he had committed serious crimes such as \nmurder and rape when they told him after his day one polygraph that his breathing was \nnot right and he was failing the test. In an effort to cooperate, Applicant revealed this \npersonal information that was quite embarrassing. (GE 4, P. 14)  \nCharacter Evidence \nDuring his clearance review with the OGA, Applicant provided a number of \ncharacter statements from work colleagues and personal friends. Included among those \nstatements were two from his current CEO. He stated that Applicant is honest, \ntrustworthy, forthright, and that his character is beyond reproach. He strongly \nrecommends that he retain his clearance. Two other coworkers attest to Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. A retired Navy captain who has \nknown Applicant for over 40 years also noted his traits for reliability, honesty, and \ntrustworthiness. Two neighbors, who have known Applicant for over 20 years described \nhis honesty, trustworthiness, and reliability. (GE 5, pp. 34-42) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThere are some inconsistencies with Applicant\u2019s prior summarized interview, his \npolygraph interviews, and his hearing testimony. However, after reviewing all the \nsources of his prior statements, I conclude that his testimony, subject to cross-\nexamination, and his background interview, which he was allowed to correct, bear more \nprobative weight than the polygraph interview summaries, particularly when the \npolygraphers were not available to explain their report and be subjected to cross \nexamination. \nIn the 1980s, when Applicant was in his 20s, single, and before he held a \nsecurity clearance, he visited three adult modeling studios (strip clubs) and paid for \nmanual stimulation of his genitals. In 2012, after receiving a security clearance, and \nafter he was divorced, Applicant visited a brothel four different times and paid for sex \nwhile in Germany. The Government presented no evidence that these acts were illegal \nin Germany at that time. In 2013 and either late 2016 or early 2017, Applicant visited \ntwo different massage parlors and received manual stimulation on both occasions. He \nclaimed that on neither occasion did he solicit these actions by the respective \nmasseuses. They engaged him without his consent. Although the polygraph report \nconflicts with Applicant\u2019s testimony about his intent, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony and his \nstatement to his background investigator more credible than the polygraph report, which \nwas not supported by testimony, and therefore not subject to cross examination. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(a), 13(c) and 13(d) apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for sexual behavior under \nAG \u00b6 14 and considered the following potentially relevant: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \nApplicant\u2019s three visits to strip clubs occurred almost 40 years ago. He has \ndiscontinued that activity. He visited a brothel in a foreign country on four occasions \nright after his divorce because he was lonely. He believed his actions were lawful in that \ncountry. He has not engaged in that activity since 2012. He was an unintentional \nparticipant in two instances where masseuses engaged in manual stimulation of his \ngenitals in 2013 and either 2016 or 2017. He did not initiate the action. He no longer \ngoes to massage parlors to treat muscle soreness, but regularly sees a chiropractor \ninstead. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 13(c) both apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States. \nAs described above in the Guideline D analysis, Applicant\u2019s past sexual actions \nas described by the record call into question his lack of judgment and his vulnerabilities \nto exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(c) and 31(e) apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. The Government failed to \nestablish, per the allegation, that Applicant failed to disclose that he paid for sexual acts \noccurring in February 2017, during his April 25, 2017 polygraph interview. The evidence \nestablished that Applicant admitted during both the April 25th and 26th interviews that \nhe paid the massage fee and provided a customary tip. There is no clear admission in \nthe polygraph interview record of the April 26th interview that Applicant intended to pay \nfor sexual acts on this visit or that he paid for such acts during this visit as opposed to \npaying for the massage service. AG \u00b6 31(b) has not been established concerning SOR \n\u00b6 2.b. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAs stated under the Guideline D analysis above, Applicant\u2019s three visits to strip \nclubs occurred almost 40 years ago. He has discontinued that activity. He visited a \nbrothel in a foreign country on four occasions right after his divorce because he was \nlonely. He believed his actions were lawful in that country. He has not engaged in that \nactivity since 2012. He was an unintentional participant in two instances where \nmasseuses engaged in manual stimulation of his genitals in 2013 and either 2016 or \n2017. He did not initiate the action. He no longer goes to massage parlors to treat \nmuscle soreness, but regularly sees a chiropractor instead. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) both \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s security \nduties within the company, his significant support from his CEO, coworkers, and friends, \nand his lack of similar activity since 2017. I weighed these factors against any \ndisqualifying conduct described by the evidence. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude either the disqualifying conduct was not established, or Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines D and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old information systems technologist, employed by a defense contractor since March 2019. He graduated from high school in 2002 and attended some college. He honorably served in the United States Navy from 2002 to 2016. While on active duty, he received non-judicial punishment (NJP) for driving under the influence (DUI) in 2012. He married in 2002 and separated in 2015, and has two children. He has previously held up to a top secret security clearance. His last clearance was suspended by the DCSA on December 23, 2020. The SOR alleges under Guideline F, a $5,828 debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (SOR \u00b6 1.a); two medical debts totaling $3,808 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); and a small debt owed to a university (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges Applicant was arrested in 2019 for assault with a deadly weapon and abandonment/neglect of children, and a subsequent restraining order was issued as a result (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b); an arrest in 2015 for corporal injury to spouse/cohabitant (SOR \u00b6 1.c); an arrest and conviction (deferred prosecution) for DUI in 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and a 2012 NJP while on active duty for the civilian arrest for the DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Finally, under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a - 3.d), the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his 2020 SCA by intentionally failing to disclose: the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d, the delinquent federal debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and the remaining debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1",

The Government\u2019s \nwritten brief with supporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), \nwas submitted by Department Counsel on November 19, 2021. A complete copy of the \nFORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, rebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the \nFORM on December 7, 2021. He did not respond to the FORM, object to the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits, or submit additional documentary evidence for my consideration. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 22, 2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 2 through 10 \nare admitted into evidence without objection. GE 1 is the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer, \nwhich are already part of the record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old information systems technologist, employed by a \ndefense contractor since March 2019. He graduated from high school in 2002 and \nattended some college. He honorably served in the United States Navy from 2002 to \n2016. While on active duty, he received non-judicial punishment (NJP) for driving under \nthe influence (DUI) in 2012. He married in 2002 and separated in 2015, and has two \nchildren. He has previously held up to a top secret security clearance. His last clearance \nwas suspended by the DCSA on December 23, 2020. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, a $5,828 debt owed to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) (SOR \u00b6 1.a); two medical debts totaling $3,808 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c); and a small debt owed to a university (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline J, the SOR \nalleges Applicant was arrested in 2019 for assault with a deadly weapon and \nabandonment/neglect of children, and a subsequent restraining order was issued as a \nresult (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b); an arrest in 2015 for corporal injury to spouse/cohabitant \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); an arrest and conviction (deferred prosecution) for DUI in 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); \nand a 2012 NJP while on active duty for the civilian arrest for the DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nFinally, under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a - 3.d), the SOR alleges Applicant falsified \nhis 2020 SCA by intentionally failing to disclose: the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and \n2.d, the delinquent federal debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and the remaining debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.d. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer to the SOR \nwithout explanations, and the record evidence supports the SOR allegations. \nIn a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted by a Government investigator, \nApplicant explained that his felony arrest in 2019 was a result of heavy alcohol \nconsumption late into the night, an argument with his girlfriend at the time, and a \nconfrontation with her and her father. Applicant claimed that he was tackled from behind \nby her father, at which time he defended himself by punching the victim (father) once, \ncausing a broken eye socket or cheekbone. (GE 3) However, in May 2021, Applicant \npleaded no contest to a felony charge of inflicting corporal injury (presumably for the \nserious injury to his girlfriend\u2019s father), and an assault charge (presumably committed \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagainst his girlfriend) was dismissed. He was sentenced to 45-days community labor, and \nplaced on probation for four years, a period that would not end until 2025. As a result of \nthese charges, Applicant was issued a restraining order in 2021 to stay away from the \nvictims. (GEs 2, 3, 7, 8, 10) He did not provide information on his current probation status. \nApplicant was also arrested in 2015 and charged with inflicting corporal injury on \na spouse/cohabitant. Applicant claimed this arrest was a result of his efforts to prevent \nhis girlfriend from driving after drinking, arguing, and her falling in the parking lot because \nshe was intoxicated. He stated that the charge was dismissed after a court appearance. \n(GE 3) The record regarding the facts and reason for the dismissal is incomplete. In 2012, \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence and convicted of negligent driving \npursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement. He admitted being over the legal limit. He \nwas given a deferred prosecution but the offense resulted in disciplinary action by his \nNavy commanding officer at NJP. (GEs 3, 7, 8) \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged in the SOR, and noted in his PSI that he \nentered into a debt relief program in 2016 or 2017 that resulted in several resolved debts. \nHe noted that he intends to pay his VA debt that resulted when he dropped out of school \nafter the VA paid his tuition. He believes his large hospital debt should have been paid by \ninsurance and he intended to dispute it, but then he said he entered into a payment plan \nin July 2020 to resolve the debt. (GE 3) \nApplicant has not supplied current information regarding the status of the claimed \nresolved and remaining SOR debts, or documentary evidence of his debt relief efforts. \nHe noted in his PSI that he had used loans to pay off other loans, and it snowballed. He \nsaid that his debt relief company instructed him to stop paying on debts so they could \nnegotiate settlements on his behalf. No documentary evidence was submitted showing \nthe results of negotiations with creditors, payment progress or final resolution of any of \nthe SOR debts. Applicant intends to pay all of his debts when able. In addition, partly \nbecause he admitted the Guideline E allegations without further comment, I find Applicant \nintentionally falsified his 2020 SCA by failing to disclose his 2015 arrest, his alcohol \nrelated offense, and his debts as required. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of not responsibly meeting financial obligations. Although \nhe stated that he is using a debt relief company, he has not shown the results of efforts \nto resolve the SOR debts. He stated his good intentions with regard to debt resolution, \nbut good intentions are insufficient to establish mitigation, and he did not submit any \ndocumentary evidence showing the current status of his debts, his resolution efforts, or \ncurrent financial status. The guideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. A \nperson who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or \nnegligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period and that he can obtain and maintain \na measure of financial responsibility. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial \nresponsibility is questionable. Although he is credited with employing a debt-relief \ncompany to resolve some of his debts, no documentary evidence was to show that these \nefforts were productive or successful. Therefore, no mitigation credit can be fully applied \nto the unresolved SOR debts. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, anyone of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted, and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nconcerning his involvement in a two domestic violence incidents, a DUI, and probation \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence in mitigation. Given the totality of \nhis involvement with law enforcement between 2012 and 2019, I continue to have \nconcerns that this pattern of misconduct will continue as Applicant has not produced \nsufficient mitigating evidence that I can consider to conclude otherwise. I am not \npersuaded by the paucity of evidence in the record. It appears that Applicant remains on \nprobation with a restraining order for a felony conviction in 2021 for a domestic violence \nrelated offense, a previous domestic violence charge that was ultimately dismissed for \nunknown reasons, and a DUI deferred prosecution with an NJP. Applicant downplays his \ninvolvement in each of the domestic-related incidents but did not provide documentary \nevidence to support his contentions. In both domestic violence instances, he essentially \ndenied committing any physical acts against the victims except in self-defense, yet in at \nleast one instance, he nonetheless pleaded no contest. My findings under Guideline E \nalso negatively impact my view as to the credibility of his explanations. \nI remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment at \nthis time. Insufficient time has passed without additional incidents, I have little evidence \nof restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement, and \nApplicant apparently remains on probation. No mitigation credit applies. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under AG \u00b616 is: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his 2021 SCA constitutes disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline E. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in his Answer, and the documentary \nevidence supports the SOR. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications \nof his 2020 SCA. He has had past experience with completing SCAs, and has not \nsatisfactorily explained his admitted failure to report required information. The only \ncriminal offenses he reported on the SCA were his pending 2019 felony charges. His \n2015 domestic violence charge should have been reported as an arrest within seven \nyears, and his DUI should have been reported as an alcohol related offense. In addition, \nhis delinquent debts were required to be reported as a Federal debt and debts that are in \na delinquent/collection status, but Applicant did not. I am not satisfied that sufficient time \nhas passed, that the offense is minor, unique, or infrequent, or that Applicant has shown \nthat this conduct is behind him and will not recur. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations \nand did not provide sufficient and persuasive evidence in mitigation. His behavior \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, PSI, and interrogatory responses. Since he elected a decision \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to view assess his credibility based on his \ndemeanor and responses to inquiries. I am not convinced that Applicant is willing or able \nto permanently put his past misconduct aside and show good judgment in all areas of his \nlife, especially those that are relevant to security eligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 2.a - 2.e: \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 3.a - 3.d: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

She has a Master\u2019s degree. She holds the position of Delivery Senior Analyst \nfor a defense contractor.

Applicant has approximately $140,000 in delinquent student loan accounts, \nand $14,000 in delinquent consumer debt. In her Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations and provides explanations. Credit reports of the Applicant dated July 14, \n2020; and November 1, 2021, reflect that each of these debts were at one point owing. \n(Government Exhibits 5 and 6.) \nApplicant began working for her current employer in 2018. \nPrior to this \nemployment, she held a variety of government contracting jobs, and had various \nperiods of unemployment ranging from one to three months. Applicant attributes her \nfinancial difficulties to numerous periods of unstable employment. \nDuring these \nchallenging times, she was a mother and single parent raising and supporting four \nchildren. Throughout this period, she ensured that her children\u2019s basic needs were met. \nShe maintained a home, worked full time, took college courses, chaperoned class trips, \nattended sporting events, and took her children on college tours. \nShe accepted \nfinancial help from family when she had no other options. She was also earning her \nBachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and her Master\u2019s degree in 2016. Applicant contends that \nshe is now in a much better financial situation as her children have now grown up and \nmoved out and she no longer supports them financially. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR were of security concern: \n \nAllegation 1.a., is a debt to the U.S. Department of Education for multiple student \nloan accounts that were placed for collection in the total approximate amount of \n$140,000.00.  Applicant provided a letter from the U.S. Department of Education \nindicating that her student loan accounts have been successfully rehabilitated, are in \ngood standing and are no longer delinquent.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)            \nAllegation 1.b., is a delinquent debt owed to a bank for an account that was \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $1,788. On August 4, 2021, Applicant settled \nthe account for $540, and it is no longer owing. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nAllegation 1.c., is a delinquent debt owed to a bank for an account that was \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $1,581.

The creditor requested that she send a letter to them. On \nAugust 7, 2021, Applicant sent the letter, and is currently awaiting a response. \nApplicant intends to resolve the debt soon. \nAllegation 1.d., is a delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account that was \nplaced for collection in the approximate amount of $1,029. On November 6, 2020, \nApplicant settled the account for $575.67, and it is no longer owing. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA.) \nAllegation 1.e., is a delinquent debt owed to a creditor for a vehicle that was \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $9,913. Applicant has contacted the creditor \nand set up a repayment plan of $420.17 monthly that she plans to continue to follow. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nApplicant\u2019s unstable employment made it difficult for her to keep up with her car \npayments. She has had to borrow money from her parents and she plans to pay them \nback. In tough times, her parents have been there to help her with her finances. Now \nthat her children have moved out and have families of their own, Applicant is focused on \nresolving her debt and repairing her finances as soon as possible. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to periods of unstable employment, and having to raise and support four \nchildren on her own, Applicant became excessively indebted and could not afford to pay \nher delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant experienced periods of unstable employment and unemployment while \nshe raised and supported four children on her own. In 2018, she obtained stable \nemployment and since then she has directed her efforts on resolving her delinquent \ndebt. She has successfully rehabilitated her student loans, and they are no longer \ndelinquent. She has settled two of the other delinquent accounts, and is making regular \nmonthly payments toward resolving another. The one remaining delinquent debt listed \nin the SOR that has not been resolved, amounts to about $1,500. Applicant is waiting \nfor a response from the creditor and she intends to resolve the debt soon. Ideally, \nApplicant should have contacted these creditors before her security clearance became \nan issue. However, under the circumstances, Applicant has acted in a reasonable and \nresponsible manner. She has shown good judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. \nThere are clear indications that her financial indebtedness is being resolved and is \nunder control. Applicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and \nhas demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. AG \u00b6 20 provides full \nmitigation. The Financial Considerations concern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nshown maturity and responsibility. She understands the responsibilities involved in \npossessing a security clearance. \nShe has shown the requisite good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness required of this privilege. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe relevant financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 in this \ncase are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant\u2019s divorce, injury to his ankle, the COVID-19 pandemic and his ensuing \nlockdown in the Middle East country where he was employed, and underemployment \nwere conditions largely beyond his control. His monthly child support payments and \npayments for health care insurance substantially reduced his income. Moreover, he acted \nreasonably under the circumstances because he paid, brought to current status, or \nresolved the majority of his SOR debts, and he established payment plans for his \nremaining debts whenever possible. \nTwo Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) when an Applicant lacks the income to address debts. In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had $41,871 in delinquent credit card debt and \ndefaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at \n1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)\u201d even though that applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board \nalso decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. It is noteworthy that Applicant has the burden of proving the \napplicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition \nnever shifts to the Government. \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the \nability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted \u201cit will be a long time at best before \nhe has paid\u201d all of his creditors. Id. at 3. The applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.  \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 07-06482 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)). The applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 used his limited \nresources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment plan for the remaining \ndebts; and (3) took \u201creasonable actions to effectuate that plan.\u201d Id. The Appeal Board \nremanded the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision because it did not \u201carticulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for his conclusions,\u201d emphasizing the Administrative Judge did \u201cnot explain[] \nwhat he believes that applicant could or should have done under the circumstances that \nhe has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach taken \nby applicant was not \u2018responsible\u2019 in light of his limited circumstances.\u201d Id.  \nThe timing of the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts is a pertinent consideration. The \nAppeal Board has observed, \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having \nbeen placed on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness designations are in \njeopardy may be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith requires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant \nmust do more than merely sh\n \now that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

When a person moves frequently, sometimes receipts are \nmailed to a previous address or are lost.

The Appeal Board has concluded that careful scrutiny of a late \nfiling of a tax return is still necessary even when no taxes are owed based on that overdue \nreturn because a failure to timely file a tax return is a violation of a federal rule. \nApplicant paid his state income taxes; however, he still owes about $10,500 to the \nfederal government. Applicant is financially inexperienced. He failed to show due \ndiligence when he filed his tax returns, and he failed to include all of his income, thereby \naccruing this federal tax debt. He will be able to pay this debt once he starts his new \noverseas employment over the next year. He promised to continue to establish his \nfinancial responsibility, and I found his hearing statement to be sincere, candid, and \nhonest. \nThere are clear indications that Appellant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved \nor are under control. See Tr. 61-64. He received financial counseling and generated a \nbudget. He made a good-faith effort to resolve several of his delinquent debts, and I am \nconfident he will rapidly resolve the remainder with the increase in financial resources \nresulting from his overseas employment. His finances do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old communications specialist who seeks employment in \nthe Middle East working for a defense contractor. In 2005, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He served in the ARNG from 2015 to 2019, including overseas in Afghanistan \nand Kuwait. When he was discharged from the ARNG, he received an honorable \ndischarge. In 2012, he married, and in 2016, he divorced. His children are ages 10, 11, \nand 16. He received several Army awards and ribbons and completed several Army \ntraining courses. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, when he resolved or \nestablished payment plans on all of his debts. He understands that he needs to pay his \ndebts, and the conduct required to retain his security clearance. The Appeal Board has \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \non all outstanding debts simultaneously.

May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt re-payment. With the increased income from his new employment in a \nMiddle East country, I am confident he will have the ability and resources to pay his \nfederal income tax debt in the next 12 months, and that he will maintain his financial \nresponsibility. Security officials have the ability to monitor his financial progress, and \nrevoke his security clearance if he shows future financial irresponsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He has been married twice, first in 1999 and then in \n2019. His first marriage ended in divorce in December 2017. He has minor child and a \nstepchild. Applicant earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees from a prestigious university in 1983 \nand a master\u2019s degree in 1999.

Paragraph 1.a alleges that Appellant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from about December 2006 to at least January 2021. Paragraphs 1.b \nand 1.c allege that he used marijuana after having been granted a security clearance in \nDecember 2006 and again in August 2020.

He also wrote in his Answer that he \ndisagreed with the basis of the AG, cited in the SOR, that marijuana use gives rise to \nsecurity concerns. He argued that alcohol use gave rise to similar concerns as marijuana \nuse and Guideline G is the more appropriate adjudicative guideline to be used to assess \nthe security risks raised by his continued use of marijuana. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified about his past marijuana use. He said that he \nused marijuana once on a family vacation in 2006. He estimated that he used marijuana \nfive to six times in the 2010-to-2014-time period. He started smoking marijuana about \nonce a month during the period 2014 until 2016 when the recreational use of marijuana \nwas legalized in his state of residence. During that two-or-three-year period, he used a \nmedical marijuana card and smoked marijuana to ease certain psychological and physical \nproblems he was experiencing due to the end of his first marriage. After 2016, he began \ningesting edibles containing THC or using a vape pen to inhale smoke containing CBD \noil. He purchased these marijuana products from state-licensed dispensaries. The \nfrequency of such use during the period 2016 up to the present time is about once or \ntwice a month. He intends to continue using marijuana/THC in one form or another in the \nfuture. His last use was four days before the hearing. (Tr. at 28-31, 37.) \nWith respect to the SOR allegations that he used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance, he testified that during the periods in question he was not engaged in \nworking with classified information. He said that he stopped working with classified \ninformation in 2003 when he left his DoD position. He also testified that he cannot be \ncertain that he used any marijuana product after he was briefly granted an interim security \nclearance in 2020 and before it was revoked. (Tr. at 34-36.) \nApplicant submitted two articles in support of his argument about alcohol and \nmarijuana. Applicant also argued that the Federal Government has de facto legalized \nmarijuana and that it is inappropriate to assess security risks under Guideline H, which is \nthe basis for the SOR allegations. He contends that the more appropriate adjudicative \nguideline is Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). (Tr. at 25; AE A; AE B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1, Guideline H \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and \nnon-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or \nmental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 could apply to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted past use of marijuana establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (f). \nThe record evidence, however, does not support a conclusion that Appellant used \nmarijuana during the brief period after he was granted an interim clearance in 2020. His \nnumerous statements of intent to continue using marijuana, including during his hearing \ntestimony, as corroborated by his ongoing use up until four days before his hearing, \nestablish disqualification under AG \u00b6 25(g).  \nAG \u00b6 26 sets forth four mitigating conditions under Guideline H. The following \nmitigating condition has possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a) has not been established. Applicant intends to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future, which casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment. He has not shown that he is willing to comply with rules \nand regulations with which he disagrees, and stated his intent to continue such conduct. \nOn the issue raised by Applicant regarding the U.S. Government policy with \nrespect to marijuana, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a scientific \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand medical review of the status of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance under \nthe \nControlled \nSubstances \nAct. \nThe \nreport \nis \navailable \nfor \nreview \nat \nhttps://www.fda.gov/files/Marijuana%20Schedule%20I%20Recommendation.pdf . The \nFDA declined to reclassify marijuana. Applicant\u2019s position that marijuana has been de \nfacto legalized at the Federal level is simply incorrect. Moreover, that argument has no \nlegal merit. It is black letter law that a DOHA administrative adjudication proceeding is not \nan appropriate forum to seek policy changes. ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 2 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 18, 2016) (DOHA proceedings are not a proper forum to debate the merits of DoD \npolicy concerning marijuana).   \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement and his intent to use marijuana in the future. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a,1.c, and 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

(Id.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

However, \u201c[e]ven if \napplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with the IRS over the years or that he worked diligently \nto timely file his tax returns and timely pay his federal income taxes. He did not act \nresponsibly with respect to his federal income tax debt for TY 2018 because he waited \nuntil April 2022 to pay it using tax refunds. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is mitigated because an IRS tax transcript shows Applicant\u2019s TY 2017 \nfederal and state income tax returns were filed in April 2019. His failure to timely file his \nTY 2017 federal and state tax returns is not recent and is mitigated. SOR \u00b6 1.d is mitigated \nbecause he has an established payment plan designed to resolve his state income tax \ndebt, and he made multiple payments in 2021 and 2022. See AG \u00b6 20(g). SOR \u00b6 1.e is \nmitigated because the debt is paid. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2016 and 2018 \nand to timely pay any taxes due. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file \nwith the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. \nTitle 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . . make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns when due, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old engineering technician II who has worked for a defense \ncontractor for three years. In 1984, he graduated from high school. Applicant\u2019s program \nmanager lauded his diligence, responsibility, and potential for future contributions to his \nemployer. He was promoted to engineering technician II, and he is likely to be promoted \nto positions of greater responsibility in the future. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. His \nfailures to timely file tax returns were affected by several circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. He mitigated the financial issues alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. From 2020 \nto present, he made some progress paying his state tax debts, and his federal income \ntaxes are current. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide establish that he was unable to make greater progress sooner \nfiling his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016 and 2018 and to pay his federal \nincome tax debt for TY 2018. His failure to take prudent responsible actions raise \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

(Item 4) \nApplicant admits to all of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant filed bankruptcy on October 23, 2015. He claimed total assets of \n$250,433 and total liabilities of $101,795. Applicant\u2019s dischargeable debts were \ndischarged on February 1, 2016. (Item 7) After the discharge, Applicant continued to \nstruggle financially.  \nIn response to DOHA Interrogatories, dated January 18, 2021, Applicant \nauthenticated the unsworn summary of his background investigation interview as \naccurate. The interview was held June 8, 2020. At the beginning of the interview, \nApplicant was asked twice whether he had any debts that were currently over 120 days \nlate. He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d He was also asked twice whether he had any debts that were \nover 120 days late since his bankruptcy. He again answered, \u201cNo.\u201d He was also asked \ntwice about whether he had any repossessions. He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d He was then \nconfronted with numerous delinquent accounts that were not included in his bankruptcy. \n(Item 6) Applicant admitted to all of the delinquent accounts to include the two automobile \nrepossessions. He did not list the delinquent accounts on his security clearance \napplication because he was not aware they were delinquent.

The two car repossession debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f resulted from his \nwife not making the car payments because she has a gambling addiction. The two cars \nwere repossessed in December 2017. Applicant believed that he would not owe anything \nafter the two cars were repossessed. His wife spends about $2,000 every two months on \ngambling and refuses to let Applicant handle the finances. (Item 6 at 4-5) \nApplicant believed that he did not need to pay any accounts that were charged off. \nThere was only one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that was not charged off. He claims he was unable \nto make any payments towards this account because his employer and the union were \nnegotiating, which resulted in reduced work hours and pay. (Applicant provided no details \nabout the negotiations as well as specifics about his reduced pay and work hours.) (Item \n7 at 7-11) \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant states that he does not contest the \nallegations about falsifying his e-QIP application. He states he had a lack of moral and \nethical judgment, but states he \u201ccame clean\u201d when he spoke to the investigator and when \nhe answered the interrogatories. He requests that his security clearance not be denied \ndue to one moral and ethical lapse in judgment. Applicant admits his finances have been \nless than perfect. He reiterated that he was under the impression that the automobile \nrepossessions were written off. He admits that he did not live within his means for a small \nperiod of time. He has not taken action towards any of these debts because he is paying \nhis accounts that are in good standing. He has not incurred additional debt. (AE A at 1 - \n2) \nIn September 2021, Applicant was able to move to on-base housing, which allowed \nhis rent to be reduced to $1,500 a month. Other monthly payments include: $400 car \ninsurance; $240 family cell phone plan; $100 internet; $80 streaming services; $140 gas; \n$400 groceries; and $100 miscellaneous. His total monthly expenses are approximately \n$2,960. (AE B). He did not list his current monthly income, but mentioned during his \nbackground investigation interview that his monthly income was $4,890. (Item 6 at 5) \nBased on this figure, he has approximately $1,930 left over each month after expenses. \nApplicant states that although he is required to have a SECRET clearance to work \nin his building, he never handles classified information. Applicant states that he is highly \nrespected by his supervisors and co-workers. He is trying to mitigate his financial issues \nand is aware of the risks associated with financial difficulties. He would never engage in \nespionage, subversion, or anything that would cause discredit upon himself, his job, or \nhis country. He requests that he be allowed to continue to have his security clearance. \n(AE A at 3) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds  . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of financial irresponsibility, resulting in a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2015. He continued to incur delinquent debts even after his debts were \ndischarged in February 2016. The total amount of delinquent debt incurred after the \nbankruptcy discharge is $30,267. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 notes several factors that could mitigate the concern under this guideline, \nI find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has not attempted to \nresolve any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. He provided insufficient \ninformation to indicate the financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. He states his wife has a gambling problem, yet he lets her handle the household \nfinances, even though she neglects to pay the bills because she spends the money \ngambling. I am unable to conclude Applicant\u2019s financial issues are unlikely to recur and \nno longer cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Thus, I find that \nApplicant has not mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b615: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies because Applicant admits that he deliberately omitted his \ndelinquent accounts in response to Section 26 of his e-QIP. When confronted by an \ninvestigator interviewing him during his background investigation, Applicant denied he \nhad delinquent accounts, including two automobile repossessions. He only admitted the \ndebts after the investigator confronted him about his delinquent accounts. Applicant also \nclaimed that he was unaware of the accounts. In his response to the FORM. Applicant \nfinally admitted that he deliberately omitted his delinquent accounts on his security \nclearance application. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his delinquent accounts and two \nautomobile repossessions on his e-QIP application raises questions about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. This \nraises questions about Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified information.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant did not make a prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct his omitted financial delinquencies. He did not admit to his delinquent \naccounts until after the investigator confronted him with the information about his \ndelinquent debts including two automobile repossessions. His deliberate omission of his \ndelinquent accounts on his security clearance application was serious and raised \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nservice in the U.S. Army. I considered his work as a contractor for the Department of \nDefense. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and his \nintentional omission of his delinquent debts on his security clearance application. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant responded to the SOR on April 12, 2021, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on May 24, 2022. Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and A(1) through A(5), which were admitted \nwithout objection.

She has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nearned in 2005 and a master\u2019s degree earned in 2007. She is married with two children. \n(Tr. at 15-16, 29-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s husband had a good job in 2015. They felt their finances permitted \nher to leave the military, start her own business, and home school their children. Shortly \nafter her discharge, her husband was in a serious motorcycle accident involving multiple \nsurgeries and time off work. He did not lose his salary, but his income was largely \ncommission-based, so it was greatly reduced. Not all medical bills were covered in the \nsettlement they eventually received. Applicant bought into the fitness industry, which \nshe financed at least in part with a loan from a credit union. Her husband was laid off in \n2016, and unemployed for a period until he obtained a lower-paying job. Her business \nwas ultimately unsuccessful, but they had contracts to fulfill, so they stayed until they \ncould honor all of their contracts. (Tr. at 16-20, 33-37; GE 1, 2; AE A, A(5)) \nApplicant and her husband did what they could to avoid bankruptcy and losing \ntheir house to foreclosure. They worked to bring other debts current, including her \nstudent loans, an auto loan, and the mortgage. They were able to sell their house for a \nsmall profit. They decided that she would have to get a job. She accepted her current \njob and moved to an area with a lower cost of living. Her husband followed and \neventually found employment. (Tr. at 18-21, 38, 47; GE 1, 2; AE A, A(3)) \nThe SOR alleges $43,868 owed on the defaulted loan to the credit union (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and four delinquent medical debts totaling about $3,650 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e). \nApplicant talked to the credit union about the $43,868 defaulted loan on several \noccasions in 2016 and 2017. She stated that the credit union would only accept \npayments of $2,000 per month, which she could not afford. She was told that the credit \nunion was charging off the debt. Applicant did not contact the credit union after 2017, \nbecause she thought when they charged the debt off, that meant they were no longer \ninterested in collecting the debt. (Tr. at 21-23, 27, 38-40; GE 1-5; AE A) \nApplicant testified that she thought the four medical debts were eventually \nresolved by payments from the settlement or by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA). The debts are listed on the 2020 combined credit report. One debt was reported \nby all three credit reporting agencies; two debts were reported by both TransUnion and \nEquifax; and one debt was just reported by TransUnion. Two debts were listed on the \nNovember 2020 Equifax credit report. There were no medical debts listed on the \nJanuary 2022 Equifax credit report. (Tr. at 17-18, 39, 44-46; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-5; AE A, A(4)) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have stabilized. She and her husband maintain a budget. \nHer annual salary is about $115,000, plus a bonus of about $3,000. Her husband earns \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout $50,000 to $60,000 annually. She has about $50,000 in her 401(k) retirement \naccount. She and her husband bought a home in their current location in about April \n2020, financed with a mortgage loan of about $306,000. They bought a new vehicle in \nabout November 2020, financed with an auto loan of about $54,800. Their monthly \npayment is $893. Applicant has student loans. They have been current for several \nyears, but they have grown from about $52,000 to about $77,000. They are apparently \non pause as part of COVID relief. (Tr. at 21, 24-26, 31-33, 38, 41-44; GE 1-5; AE A, \nA(3)) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant contacted the credit union for the $43,868 defaulted \ncredit union loan. Their best settlement offer was $15,384. She stated that she does not \nhave the savings to pay that amount at this time. She and her husband discussed \nborrowing the money from a few different sources, however they \u201cdo not feeling putting \n[their] family in more debt is in spirit with what the government has asked in this case.\u201d \n(AE B) \nApplicant submitted documents attesting to her excellent job performance and \nmoral character. She is praised for her dedication, trustworthiness, loyalty, and integrity. \n(AE A(1), A(2)) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a defaulted loan and \nunpaid medical debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s husband was in a motorcycle accident, which affected his \ncommissions, and he later lost his job. Then her business failed. These events, which \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s financial problems, were beyond her control. In order to receive \nthe full benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant and her husband did many things right. They did what they could to \navoid bankruptcy and losing their house to foreclosure. They were able to sell their \nhouse for a small profit and worked to bring other debts current. She took a job in an \narea with a lower cost of living, and her husband followed her. Except for the large debt \nto the credit union, their finances are now stable, but that stability came at the expense \nof the credit union. She admitted that she did not contact the credit union after 2017, \nbecause she thought when they charged the debt off, that meant they were no longer \ninterested in collecting the debt. Without the burden of paying that debt, they were able \nto buy a house and a new vehicle, financed with an auto loan of about $54,800 and \n$893 monthly payments. Post-hearing, Applicant contacted the credit union. She stated \nthat their best settlement offer was $15,384, but she did not have the savings to pay \nthat amount at this time. \nI find the medical debts sufficiently resolved as to be mitigated. As to the credit \nunion debt, I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay the debt. Her financial issues \nare recent, ongoing, and continue to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to that debt. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

He did not \npresent sufficient documentary evidence to mitigate his history of financial problems. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin January 2020. (Exhibit 3) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF \n86 is commonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed during the course of a 2020 background investigation. \n(Exhibit 4) Thereafter, on July 28, 2021, after reviewing the available information, the \nDoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR in September 2021. He admitted all the factual \nallegations made in the SOR and he provided a few, brief explanatory remarks. He did \nnot provide supporting documentation. He also requested a clearance decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn September 29, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it January 24, 2022. \nHe did not reply to the FORM. The case was assigned to me March 22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking for the first time to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He has a job as a consultant for a company in the defense industry. \nHe has been so employed since December 2019. He has no previous military service. \nHis educational background includes attending college for a few months in 2014 and for \na few months in 2018. Never married, he has no children. \nA review of his SF 86 shows Applicant has an uneven employment history. He \nwas unemployed for a few months before beginning his current job in 2019. Before that, \nhe had a full-time job as a manager of a caf\u00e9 from July 2019 to October 2019. Before \nthat, he had a part-time job as a barista from March 2019 to June 2019. Before that, he \nwas a self-employed driver from September 2018 to March 2019. Before that, he was \nunemployed from July 2018 to September 2018. And before that, he had approximately \nnine different jobs dating back to 2009; several of those jobs ended when he was fired \nor terminated; and he had multiple periods of unemployment. \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of seven delinquent \naccounts in amounts ranging from $594 to $11,130 for a total amount of about $23,350. \nThe indebtedness consists of five charged-off accounts and two collection accounts. He \nadmitted the indebtedness in his answer to the SOR. In addition to his admissions, the \nSOR allegations are established by a September 2020 credit report. (Exhibit 6) Note, I \nhave not considered Exhibit 5, a November 2019 credit report, because it is incomplete, \nconsisting of only partial pages of the credit report, per the doctrine of completeness \nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 106. \nApplicant has not provided affirmative proof, via reliable documentation, that he \nhas resolved any of the seven delinquent accounts.

Concerning his answer \nto the SOR, he noted that he entered into repayment agreements for the three smallest \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. But he has not provided documentation of the \nrepayment agreements, nor has he provided proof that he has adhered to the \nagreements. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4 Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nThe evidence before me does not support a conclusion that Applicant has \nengaged in sufficient remedial efforts to justify a favorable clearance decision. He has \nnot presented any documentary evidence in support of his case. His delinquent \naccounts for more than $20,000 remain wholly unresolved. None of the mitigating \nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 20 apply here. I specifically considered his uneven \nemployment history and multiple periods of unemployment in the context of the \nmitigating condition found at AG \u00b6 20(b). Obviously, his financial problems are \nconnected to the lack of a long-term job that paid sufficient wages to allow him to \naddress past indebtedness while paying current living expenses. But Applicant does not \nreceive full credit under this mitigating condition because I cannot conclude he has \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacted responsibility under the circumstances. I reach that conclusion given the lack of \npayments on the debts in the SOR and the multiple instances of job loss due to \ntermination. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 36 years old and single. He has bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since 2008 and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted the sole allegation under this guideline. The SOR alleged that Applicant had one charged-off student loan debt in the amount of $95,606. The existence and amount of this debt is supported by credit reports dated May 1, 2020; and September 14, 2021. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) The student loan debt in this case was incurred in 2009 by Applicant\u2019s younger sister. The loan was co-signed by the Applicant, making him a joint debtor. There was some evidence that Applicant did not understand the ramifications of his co-signing for his sister\u2019s loan. The sister stopped paying on her student loans at some point after graduation due to her inability to make payments given her salary. Applicant was notified by the creditor of this default, but he did nothing to cure it since they were his sister\u2019s loans. Applicant stated he had no intention of paying this debt, even though he ",

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 14, 2021. The case was assigned to me on September 21, 2021. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on September 23, \n2021. The case was heard on October 26, 2021. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing on November 8, 2021. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant \nExhibits A through H, which were also admitted without objection, and the record closed \non November 11, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old and single. He has bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since 2008 and seeks to retain national security \neligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government \nExhibit 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted the sole allegation under this guideline. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had one charged-off student loan debt in the \namount of $95,606. The existence and amount of this debt is supported by credit reports \ndated May 1, 2020; and September 14, 2021. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) \nThe student loan debt in this case was incurred in 2009 by Applicant\u2019s younger \nsister. The loan was co-signed by the Applicant, making him a joint debtor. There was \nsome evidence that Applicant did not understand the ramifications of his co-signing for \nhis sister\u2019s loan. The sister stopped paying on her student loans at some point after \ngraduation due to her inability to make payments given her salary. Applicant was notified \nby the creditor of this default, but he did nothing to cure it since they were his sister\u2019s \nloans. Applicant stated he had no intention of paying this debt, even though he was the \nco-signer. He and his sister would occasionally talk about the situation. Applicant testified \nthat he and his sister had last talked about the loans about two years before the hearing. \n(Tr. 24-32, 36-37.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister submitted a statement after the hearing. In this statement she \nsets forth her educational background concerning the student loan. She stated in \nconclusion, \u201cCurrently, I am saving money for a settlement agreement with the collection \nagencies. I\u2019m working towards saving $30-70k and plan to have 50% of my student debts \nsettled in the next two years.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B.) \nWith the exception of his sister\u2019s unpaid student loan, Applicant\u2019s financial situation \nis stable. He paid off his own student loans and has no other delinquencies. (Tr. 21, 23-\n24; Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment, lack of candor, \nand dishonesty. Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph. \n2.a. Applicant used marijuana between approximately January 2013 and October \n2017. During that four-year period, he used marijuana about twice a week. Applicant held \na security clearance during the time he was using marijuana. Applicant testified that he \nused marijuana as a way to relieve back pain. Applicant stopped using marijuana in 2017 \nbecause he knew its continued use was not compatible with his career. He evinced a \ncredible intent not to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 32-33, 37-39; Government Exhibit \n2 at Section 23.) \n2.b. Applicant originally denied using illegal drugs in an e-QIP dated May 7, 2015.\n(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23.) He admitted his drug use on a subsequent e-QIP,\ndated March 18, 2020. (Government Exhibit 2 at Section 23.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that his falsification in 2015 was knowing and willful. By 2020 \nApplicant had stopped using marijuana and matured. With regard to possibly falsifying \nhis second questionnaire Applicant testified, \u201c[I]t didn\u2019t make sense to me why I did it the \nfirst time. So the second time I thought to myself, well, why would I do that again.\u201d (Tr. \n33-35.) \nMitigation \nApplicant presented documentary evidence supporting the fact that he is using his \neducation to help others. In addition, he received an award from his company for excellent \nwork. Finally, he submitted a university transcript showing that he is close to achieving a \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Applicant Exhibits E, F, G, and H.) \nApplicant provided a letter from a close personal friend. The friend has known \nApplicant for over 20 years and believes him to be a man of character. The witness also \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstated that Applicant is \u201cthoughtful, thorough, and conscientious while carrying out tasks.\u201d \n(Applicant Exhibit C.) \nApplicant also submitted a letter from his rabbi, who has known Applicant since \n2018. He stated, \u201cI can attest that [Applicant] is a man of integrity and honesty, and is \ndeeply committed to improving his already sterling character traits.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant co-signed for his sister\u2019s student loans. She defaulted on them and the \ncreditor looked to Applicant for resolution. No payments have been made on these debts. \nNeither Applicant or his sister have any current plans to pay or otherwise resolve this \ndebt. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, \nand shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nUnder the law, by co-signing his sister\u2019s student loan note Applicant became as \nresponsible for any future delinquency as she was. There is some evidence that Applicant\ndid not completely understand the implications of that fact at the time, but it was certainly\nmade clear to him when he was issued the SOR in April 2021. He had knowledge of the\ndebt beforehand, and testified that he had been trying to get his sister to remove him from\nthe debt. Their last conversation was two years before the hearing, though they have\nobviously communicated after the hearing. No evidence was submitted that Applicant or\nhis sister have any current intention of paying or otherwise resolving this debt. The most\nApplicant\u2019s sister would say is that she hopes to possibly resolve some of the student\nloan debt within two years. Looking particularly at AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant has not shown\nthat he has acted responsibly after learning of his responsibility for this debt. None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable to the Applicant\u2019s situation. Paragraph 1 is found\nagainst Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard\nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2013 to 2017. During that time, he was employed \nby a defense contractor and held a security clearance. He did not report these facts on \nhis e-QIP in 2015. The above disqualifying conditions have application to this case. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and related falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s drug use. He stopped using marijuana in 2017, about \nfour years before the record closed. There is no evidence of further drug use and \nApplicant evinced a credible intent not to use marijuana or other illegal drugs in the future. \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the security significance of his drug use. \nApplicant has also mitigated the significance of his 2015 falsification. By 2020 \nApplicant had matured and realized that he needed to be truthful with the government. \nHis voluntary admission on the second e-QIP was the only evidence the Government had \nto establish the former drug use, and alleviated any security significance of his prior \nfalsification. Applicant has also mitigated this allegation. Accordingly, paragraph 2 of the \nSOR is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his prior marijuana use and related falsification of a government \nquestionnaire. However, he has not mitigated the concerns over his sister\u2019s student loan \ndebt for which he co-signed. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.i under Guideline F, but she asserted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i were paid in full and that she had established a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. She did not expressly admit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a that she falsified her SCA. However, she claimed that she did not intend to falsify or withhold information. I have treated her response to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old travel specialist employed by a federal contractor since March 2018. She worked for other federal contractors from November 2004 until she was hired by her current employer. She has taken college courses but does not have a degree. She married in April 2014 and has no children. She has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from May 2018 (Exhibit 7), June 2020 (Exhibit 8) and May 2022 (Exhibit 9). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. SOR \u00b6 1.a: auto lease past due for $4,738, with a balance of $43,268. In the PSI, Applicant denied owning an auto from this manufacturer and stated that she intended to dispute the debt. (Exhibit 6 at 3.) In her answer to the SOR, she admitted the debt and stated that she was in contact with the creditor, but she provided no information about the status of the debt.

She submitted a second SCA on April 22, 2020. \nOn February 5, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 23, 2022, and February 8, 2022, and \nrequested a decision on the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case in an undated document. On May 31, 2022, a \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was \ngiven an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on June 7, 2022, and did not \nrespond. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2022. \nEvidentiary Issue \nFORM Exhibit 6 is a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted on \nJune 26, 2020. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that she was entitled to comment on \nthe accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; \nor object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nI conclude that Applicant waived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to respond \nto the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are \nexpected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.i under Guideline F, but she asserted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i were \npaid in full and that she had established a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nShe did not expressly admit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a that she falsified her \nSCA. However, she claimed that she did not intend to falsify or withhold information. I \nhave treated her response to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. Her admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old travel specialist employed by a federal contractor since \nMarch 2018. She worked for other federal contractors from November 2004 until she was \nhired by her current employer. She has taken college courses but does not have a degree. \nShe married in April 2014 and has no children. She has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from May 2018 \n(Exhibit 7), June 2020 (Exhibit 8) and May 2022 (Exhibit 9). The evidence concerning \nthese debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: auto lease past due for $4,738, with a balance of $43,268. In the \nPSI, Applicant denied owning an auto from this manufacturer and stated that she intended \nto dispute the debt. (Exhibit 6 at 3.) In her answer to the SOR, she admitted the debt and \nstated that she was in contact with the creditor, but she provided no information about the \nstatus of the debt. The May 2020 credit report reflects that the debt is a joint account \nopened in August 2017, with the last activity in September 2017. (Exhibit 8 at 3.) For \nreasons not reflected in the record, the debt is not listed in the May 2022 credit report. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e: four student loans placed for collection of $14,229; $5,961; \n$5,832; and $3,786. The credit report from May 2018 reflected three student loans. One \nwas opened in October 2007 with a balance of $17,574. A second was opened in March \n2011 for $5,188. A third was opened in March 2011 for $3,441. All three loans were \nreflected as current on the March 2018 credit report. (Exhibit 7.) \nThe June 2020 credit report reflected that all three loans had been transferred to \nthe U.S. Government after being past due for 120 days or more. (Exhibit 8.) The credit \nreport from May 2022 reflected that the loans for $14,229 and $5,832 were consolidated \ndirect loans, and the loans for $5,961 and $3,786 were direct loans. All loans were \nreferred for collection. (Exhibit 8.) \nIn the PSI, Applicant stated that she intended to consolidate her student loans. \n(Exhibit 6 at 3.) In her answer to the SOR, she stated that she intended to make \narrangements to resolve all of her delinquent student loans. Collection of payments on \nthe loans is paused under the CARES Act until December 31, 2022. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: medical debt placed for collection of $1,681. In Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR, she stated that she had established a payment plan providing for payments \nof $60 per month for 26 months. She attached a receipt to her answer reflecting a $100 \npayment on January 3, 2022. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical debt placed for collection of $1,661. In Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR, she stated that this debt was paid in full and that a receipt was attached. \nHowever, the record contains no receipt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: college tuition debt placed for collection of $1,049. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, she stated that she will make arrangements to resolve this debt. It is \nnot resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $245. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated that this debt was paid in full, and she attached \na receipt reflecting the payment. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA in March 2018, she answered \u201cNo\u201d to all the \nquestions about delinquent debts in Section 26. (Exhibit 5 at 26-28.) The SOR does not \nallege falsification of the March 2018 SCA. When Applicant submitted her second SCA in \nApril 2020, she was familiar with the form, having previously submitted an SCA. The \ncontent and organization of the two SCAs is virtually identical. She again answered \u201cNo\u201d \nto the same questions. She did not disclose any of the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR. She admitted the debts when she was confronted with them during the PSI. In her \nanswer to the SOR, she admitted that she did not answer the financial questions correctly, \nbut she denied intending to falsify or withhold information. She did not provide any \nexplanation for her negative answers to the financial questions. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nIn the PSI, Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to \u201chealth issues.\u201d She stated \nthat she was able to work in a limited capacity. (Exhibit 6 at 3.) She did not provide any \ndetails about the nature of her health problems or the impact of her health problems on \nher ability to pay her debts. She also did not provide any information on her current \nincome, expenses, or overall financial situation. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. In the PSI, Applicant attributed her delinquent debts \nto \u201chealth issues.\u201d She has not provided any further information or documentation \nshowing the nature of her health issues or their impact on her ability to pay her debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and her financial problems are not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the delinquent auto lease alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant admitted the debt in her answer to the SOR. The fact that the lease is not \nreflected in the May 2022 credit report is not meaningful evidence of the disposition of the \ndebt. See ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). This mitigating \ncondition also is not established for the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. The \ncredit reports reflect that she has made some progress in consolidating her student loans, \nbut they appear to have become delinquent before COVID-19, and she has not \ndemonstrated that she is able and willing to resume payments when the current pause is \nlifted. This mitigating condition is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, on which \nshe is making payments, and SOR \u00b6 1.i, which has been paid in full. It is not established \nfor the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, because she did not provide documentation to \nsupport her assertion that the debt is paid. It is not established for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, because a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a substitute for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2019). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant initially denied any knowledge of the \ndelinquent auto lease alleged in SOR 1.b and declared her intention to dispute it. \nHowever, she later acknowledged and admitted it in her answer to the SOR. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under this guideline is set out in AG 16: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature adult with some college education and with considerable \nexperience working for federal contractors. She submitted an SCA in 2018 and was \nfamiliar with the content of the questionnaire. Although she denied intentional falsification \nof her most recent SCA, she provided no explanation for her negative answers to the \nfinancial questions. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct the omissions in \nher SCA until she was confronted with the evidence during the PSI, two months after she \nsubmitted her SCA. She has provided no explanation for the omissions. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification of her SCA was arguably \n\u201cinfrequent,\u201d but it was recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. \nFalsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor,\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question her about her financial \nproblems and her omissions from her SCA. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts and lack of candor \nduring the adjudication of her application for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He graduated from high school in 1989, and shortly thereafter enlisted in the U.S. Army. Apparently, he served about a year on active duty and was then transferred to the Inactive Reserve where he served until 1997. He stated that he received an honorable discharge. While in the service, Applicant was granted eligibility for access to top-secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). A federal contractor hired Applicant in 2006, and he has been working for subsequent federal contractors to present as a contract security supervisor. He also worked part-time for another federal contractor between 2009 and 2014. He was granted eligibility for access to secret information in 2009 and to top-secret in 2011. His access to classified information has been continued to present. His employment history indicates no periods of unemployment or underemployment. Applicant married his wife in 2008.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/12/2022 \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been financially \nresponsible addressing his delinquent accounts. He failed to establish he has taken \ngood-faith efforts to resolve his debts and that his financial situation is under control. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nJanuary 16, 2020, seeking clearance eligibility required for his employment with a \nfederal contractor. He was interviewed by a government background investigator on \nMarch 4, 2020, and submitted documents in mitigation, explanation, or extenuation \nfollowing the interview. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on \nFebruary 4, 2021, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR on February 9, 2021, and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant on September 10, \n2021. He received the FORM on October 6, 2021, and was given 30 days after receipt \nof the FORM to raise objections, to submit evidence in extenuation and mitigation, and \nto submit evidence of his efforts to resolve his financial problems. He did not submit an \nanswer to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 2, 2021. Without \nobjections, I admitted and considered the Government\u2019s proposed evidence and \nApplicant\u2019s documentary evidence submitted in response to the SOR.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent accounts including: three charged-off credit \naccounts for $10,542 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c); and two accounts in collection, totaling \naround $1,272 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). In his answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, and denied all of the remaining SOR allegations. His admission is \nincorporated herein in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He graduated from high school in 1989, and shortly \nthereafter enlisted in the U.S. Army. Apparently, he served about a year on active duty \nand was then transferred to the Inactive Reserve where he served until 1997. He stated \nthat he received an honorable discharge. While in the service, Applicant was granted \neligibility for access to top-secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI).  \n  \nA federal contractor hired Applicant in 2006, and he has been working for \nsubsequent federal contractors to present as a contract security supervisor. He also \nworked part-time for another federal contractor between 2009 and 2014. He was \ngranted eligibility for access to secret information in 2009 and to top-secret in 2011. His \naccess to classified information has been continued to present. His employment history \nindicates no periods of unemployment or underemployment. Applicant married his wife \nin 2008. They have six children, ages 31, 30, 27, 15, 11, and 10. He previously married \nin 1989 and became a widower in 1994.  \n \nAll of the SOR debts are established by the credit reports in evidence, Applicant\u2019s \nSOR admission, and his statement to investigators during his March 4, 2020 interview. \n(FORM, Items 6-8; Item 5) The status of the accounts alleged in the SOR follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,264) is a credit card account Applicant opened in 2010. He made \nhis last payment on the account in about 2018, and after many collection efforts, the \ncreditor charged-off the account. Applicant submitted no additional information on this \naccount or any evidence of his intent (if any) to resolve this debt in the future. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($2,936); 1.c ($1,342); and 1.d ($733) alleged charged-off credit card \naccounts owed to the same credit provider. In his SOR answer, Applicant denied the \nthree allegations. However, in his March 2020 statement, he admitted having some \naccounts with the provider and claimed the accounts became delinquent because he \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhad to provide financial help to his parents and grandparents. He provided no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate the need for him to provide financial support to \nrelatives, the period when the support was provided, or the extent of the financial \nsupport. \n \nState court records show that the credit provider successfully filed at least two \ncollection actions against Applicant. In 2017, it filed a collection action for $3,580, and \nobtained a consent judgment for $2,860 in January 2020. The judgment was satisfied in \nSeptember 2020. (FORM, Item 9) Apparently, some of Applicant\u2019s property was \ngarnished to satisfy part of the judgment. (FORM, Item 9) \n \nIn December 2017, the creditor filed a collection action for $1,518, and obtained \na consent judgment for $1,288 in January 2020. A lien was recorded against Applicant \nin October 2020, and a garnishment of wages was granted in May 2021. (FORM, Items \n10 and 11) Applicant submitted no evidence to show that this judgment has been \nsatisfied. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($733) alleged an account in collection by a collection company on \nbehalf of the same credit provider alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. In his SOR answer, \nApplicant denied the allegation. However, in his March 2020 statement, he admitted \nhaving some accounts with the provider and claimed the accounts became delinquent \nbecause he had to provide financial help to his parents and grandparents. He provided \nno documentary evidence to corroborate the financial support provided. The account is \nestablished by the record evidence. Applicant submitted no evidence to show that the \naccount has been paid or otherwise resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($539) alleged a medical account in collection. In his March 2020 \nstatement, Applicant admitted that he incurred the medical expense in 2014. He \nbelieved his insurance would have paid the debt, but then discovered it was not paid. \nApplicant submitted no evidence of his efforts to contact the creditor or to repay the \ndebt. He disputed this debt, and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d in \nJanuary 2020. He submitted no reasonable basis to justify the disputes. \n \nApplicant submitted no evidence about his efforts to pay his debts, or of any \ncontacts with his creditors to establish payment arrangement. He presented no \nevidence to show he has participated in financial counseling or has a working budget. \nHe did not present evidence of his and his wife\u2019s current financial situation (gross \nmonthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder).  \n \nExcept for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($6,264) and 1.c ($1,342), \nApplicant\u2019s September 2021 credit report shows no additional delinquencies. He paid a \n$36 medical account in collection in September 2021, and has a credit card with a \n$3,070 balance that is over his $2,700 credit limit, but it is not past due. The 2021 credit \nreport also shows that he is current (pays as agreed) on his auto loan with a monthly \npayment of $651, and on his monthly mortgage payments for $446 and $1,990. Without \n\n \n4 \n \n \nany documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not possible for me to \nassess whether or not he is financially overextended  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \n Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. Between 2010 and \n2020, he acquired five delinquent accounts, three of which were charged off and two \nwere in collection. The creditor of three of the accounts filed two collection suits and \nobtained two judgments against Applicant. Applicant presented no evidence of any \ngood-faith efforts on his part to pay, settle, or resolve his debts, except for disputing the \naccounts without articulating a reasonable basis for the disputes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant claimed his financial situation was aggravated because he had to \nprovide financial help to his parents and grandparents. He implied that his income alone \nwas insufficient to pay his accrued debts, living expenses, and assist his family. \nNotwithstanding, he failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate his claims of \nproviding support to his family. Even if his financial problems could be attributed to, or \nwere aggravated by, circumstances beyond his control (providing financial assistance to \nhis parents), Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he has been financially \nresponsible under his circumstances. Applicant failed to submit evidence of his contacts \nwith his creditors or of any payments made since he acquired the debts. He failed to \nestablish his good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts and that his financial \nsituation is under control. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time.  \n \nIn this instance, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial responsibility, and that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the future, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. In this case, Applicant did not make any offers to resolve any of \nthe accounts in the future. Additionally, he presented no evidence to show he has \nparticipated in financial counseling or has a working budget. He did not present \nevidence of his current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly \nexpenses, and monthly net remainder). The financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 50, served nine years in the Army and the Reserves and held high-\nlevel clearances during his service. He has been employed with federal contractors \nsince 2006. He also has held high-level clearances with the federal contractors. \nNotwithstanding, his evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been financially \nresponsible addressing his delinquent accounts. He failed to establish he has taken \ngood-faith efforts to resolve his debts and that his financial situation is under control. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She is seeking to obtain national security eligibility in connection with her work with DoD. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations. 1.a. Applicant admitted using marijuana from about 2007 through September 2017. She used marijuana with varying frequencies during that time, at one point using marijuana three times a week (2013-2015). She stated that the use was encouraged by her then-boyfriend, who was an avid marijuana user.

A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 4, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on \nNovember 30, 2021. \nIn the FORM Department Counsel stated that the Government withdrew \nParagraphs 3 and 4 of the SOR and all subparagraphs under them. Accordingly, no \nfinding is made as to those paragraphs. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old administrative clerk with a defense contractor. She is \nsingle and has two children. She is a high school graduate. She is seeking to obtain \nnational security eligibility in connection with her work with DoD. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under this \nparagraph with explanations. \n1.a. Applicant admitted using marijuana from about 2007 through September 2017. \nShe used marijuana with varying frequencies during that time, at one point using \nmarijuana three times a week (2013-2015). She stated that the use was encouraged by \nher then-boyfriend, who was an avid marijuana user. In her Answer she stated, \u201cI am no \nlonger involved with those persons and have since stopped using marijuana and started \nfocusing on my career and my children.\u201d (Item 2 at 3.) \nIn Applicant Exhibit A she further stated, \u201cDuring the time that I was engaging in \nquestionable activities, I was in a dark place in my life.

Since leaving that \nrelationship, I have cut ties with all of those people and no longer associate with anyone \nfrom that part of my life.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted that she tested positive for marijuana in January 2015 \nduring a drug test administered by her then-employer (Company One). This incident is \nfurther discussed under subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b, below. \nApplicant stated in Applicant Exhibit A, \u201cPlease note that in September of 2020, a \nnew company took over my contract. As a part of their company policy, I was administered \nan initial drug test, which I passed and am subject to random testing at any time.\u201d She \nincluded a copy of her employer\u2019s Drug/Alcohol Workplace Policy as an attachment to \nApplicant Exhibit A. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. She admitted allegations 2.a through 2.e under this paragraph with \nexplanations. \n2.a. Applicant admitted that she was involuntarily separated from Company One\nas a result of the positive drug test set forth under subparagraph 1.a, above.  \n \n2.b Applicant filled out an e-QIP in April 2019. (Item 3.) Section 13A of the \nquestionnaire asked Applicant about her employment history, including with Company \nOne. She admitted working there from January 2013 to February 2015. She stated that \nthe reason for leaving the company was, \u201cAcquired new employment.\u201d \nThe questionnaire also asked Applicant whether during her employment with \nCompany One \u201cany of the following happened to you in the last seven (7) years? \nFired/Quit after being told you would be fired/Left by mutual agreement following charges \nor allegations of misconduct/Left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance.\u201d (Emphasis in original) Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d These were false \nanswers to relevant questions about Applicant\u2019s prior employment history with Company \nOne.  \nApplicant stated in Item 2 at 3: \nI was being drug tested for a new position in the company [Company One]. \nI was aware that I would not pass the test so while waiting for the results I \nfound employment elsewhere. After being informed of the results by the \ncompany that conducted the test, I informed my manager at the time of the \nresults and he informed my district manager who happened to be visiting \nthe store that day. I was effectively sent home that afternoon and was later \ncontacted by HR for the company. By that point, I had a tentative start date \nfor my new employer and did not return their call. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.c. Section 23 of the same questionnaire asked Applicant about her drug use \nhistory. Specifically, Applicant was asked whether she had used controlled substances \nduring the previous seven years. Applicant stated, \u201cNo.\u201d This statement was false in that \nApplicant had actually used marijuana between 2007 and 2017, as set forth above. \n2.d. Applicant was interviewed on July 17, 2019, by an authorized investigator for \nthe Department of Defense. (Item 4.) During that interview Applicant stated that she had \nleft her employment with Company One because the daily commute was too long for her.  \nApplicant was re-interviewed on August 5, 2019. She initially restated that she \nvoluntarily left that employment. It was only after being confronted by the investigator with \nthe facts of her positive drug test that she admitted being sent home after she told her \nmanager of the positive drug test. \nThe Report of Investigation also stated: \nSubject [Applicant] stated that she did not list this information in her case \npapers or bring it up during her interview because she did not view her \nseparation from [Company One] as a termination. Subject stated that she \nwas never told she was terminated and never signed any paperwork \nshowing she had been terminated. Subject viewed her separation from \n[Company One] as her leaving for another employment opportunity. Subject \nclaimed that she was not attempting to conceal or falsify this information in \nany way. (Item 4 at 4-5.) \n2.e. During the same July 17, 2019 interview Applicant verified that her answers \non the April 17, 2019 e-QIP to questions concerning drug use were correct. She was re-\ninterviewed on August 5, 2019. When confronted concerning her drug use history \nApplicant admitted making a false statement in the earlier interview \u201cdue to believing that \na positive response to drug questions could hurt her possibility of gaining employment.\u201d \n(Item 4 at 5.) \nRegarding all the falsification allegations Applicant stated, \u201cI admit that I did falsify \nmaterial facts on my e-QIP and during my interview regarding my drug use. I was afraid \nthat admission of these facts would hinder my chances of getting the job, which I greatly \nneeded,\u201d (Item 2 at 3.)  \nApplicant stated the following in Applicant Exhibit A. \u201cWorking with the military has \ngiven me a new perspective of the terms \u201cHonor, Courage and Commitment\u201d and what it \nmeans to serve our nation. I now know that honor means being held accountable for my \npersonal behavior and, taking responsibility for my actions and being honest and truthful.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a letter from her supervisor. The supervisor stated, \u201cShe \n[Applicant] has been, honest, very responsible, hardworking, prompt, highly reliable, and \ndedicated to our mission.\u201d (Item 2 at Enclosure 5.) \nA co-worker of Applicant\u2019s, who has worked with her for two years, wrote in a letter \nthat, \u201cShe [Applicant] is dedicated, punctual, and has the best work ethic of anyone I have \nmet in a long time.\u201d She also stated, \u201cAlthough [Applicant] has made some poor choices \nin her past, she has learned from her mistakes and has excelled in her current position.\u201d \n(Item 2 at Enclosure 6.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. (Emphasis in \noriginal.)  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(b) testing positive for any illegal drug. \nApplicant used marijuana on an occasionally frequent basis from 2007 to 2017. \nShe tested positive for marijuana in 2015 while employed at Company One. All of the \nstated disqualifying conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for about ten years, occasionally frequently, ending five \nyears ago. This use was in the context of an abusive relationship with a boyfriend who \nwas an avid marijuana user. Applicant has now left the relationship, has a good job, has \nabstained from marijuana use, and evinced a credible intent not to use it in the future. I \nam viewing her signed Answer and signed Applicant Exhibit A as equivalent to a signed \nstatement of intent. Viewed in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated \nthe security significance of her past drug use. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant knowingly falsified material facts about her drug use history, including \nthe circumstances concerning her employment with Company One, on a Government \npersonnel security questionnaire in 2019. She also falsified the same facts during an initial \ninterview with an authorized DoD investigator. The cited disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant now admits that her conduct in falsifying relevant information on her \nquestionnaire and in an initial interview was wrong and detrimental to her future and \ncareer. The positive statements from a co-worker and a supervisor have also been \nconsidered. However, the fact remains that only three years ago Applicant falsified her \nanswers on a questionnaire and then repeated them to an investigator. It was only after \nbeing confronted with the fact that DoD knew the truth did she corroborate the information. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated her drug \nuse. However, her falsifications are too recent in time to be mitigated based on the \navailable record. She may well be eligible for a security clearance in the future, with a \nlonger history of credible employment. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through U. \nThere were no objections and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified \non his own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 9, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h and denied \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nand 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He served in the military from 1988 to 1992, deployed \nduring Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and was honorably discharged. He \nearned an associate degree in 1994. He has three children ages 27, 21, and 17. He was \nmarried from 2003 to 2013. Applicant has owned his own business since 2005. He has \naccepted a job with a federal contractor. He will continue to own his business, but it will \nbe managed by someone else. (Tr. 15-19) \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s business was burned. The losses from the fire included a \nbuilding, vehicles, tools and records that were used to conduct his business. All of the \nassets associated with the business were destroyed by the fire. It was determined the fire \nwas set by arsonists and was racially motivated with slurs written on the building. The \ndebts alleged in the SOR were accounts associated with his business. He was the sole \nowner of the business and was unable to pay the accounts at the time, but stated he was \nresponsible for them and intended to pay them. After the fire, he contacted many of his \ncreditors and used his savings to pay many of his debts, but could not afford to pay all of \nthem at that time. He paid many debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He paid down \nsome of the amounts owed in the accounts to show he was making a good-faith effort to \nresolve them even if he was unable to make the full payment. He did not want the creditors \nto think he had abandoned the debts. He was able to refinance his home in 2022 in order \nto pay some of the remaining debts. (Tr. 17-19, 43-44, 56) \nThe debts alleged are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, statements, and \ncredit reports from March 2020, October 2020, and May 2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant has paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($18,446-AE A); 1.c ($4,527\u00ad\nAE B); 1.d ($887-AE C); 1.e ($386-AE D); 1.f ($92-AE E); and 1.g ($165-AE F). These \ndebts are resolved. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($39,195-AE H) is enrolled in a payment plan \nand Applicant has been making payments of approximately $800 a month since October \n2021. SOR \u00b6 1.a is being resolved. (Tr. 20-29, 41-42, 44-49) \nAfter the fire, the insurance company refused to pay for the losses, and Applicant \nfiled a lawsuit.

(Tr. 46, 53; AE H) \nApplicant credibly testified that when he completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA) in January 2020, he believed he had to only disclose his personal debts. \nHe did not think he had to disclose his business debts and did not disclose those that are \nalleged in the SOR. He testified he did not deliberately fail to disclose or attempt to hide \nhis debts. He acknowledges he made a mistake. I found his explanation credible. (Tr. 35, \n51-53) \nApplicant did not disclose in his SCA that he had been charged in about May 2007 \nwith felony aggravated assault, felony aggravated battery, and felony possession of a \nfirearm or knife during the commission of or attempted to commit certain felonies. He was \nrequired to disclose if he had ever been charged with any felony offense, to which he \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d (Tr. 36-39, 51-53) \nApplicant testified that in 2007 he was involved in altercation and was protecting \nhis family from bodily harm. He was licensed to carry a weapon and he discharged it. He \nwas arrested and was permitted to participate in a first offender program, which deferred \nadjudication. He successfully completed the program. Applicant credibly testified that the \njudge told him the status of the charge would be like it never happened. Applicant relied \non what he was told by the judge when he completed his SCA and did not disclose his \nfelony arrest. (Tr. 35-39) The Order of Discharge from the State ordered: \nThe defendant be discharged without adjudication of guilt; \n \nThat this discharge shall completely exonerate the defendant of any criminal \npurpose;  \n \nThat this discharge shall not affect any of said defendant\u2019s civil rights or \nliberties;  \n \nThe defendant shall not be considered to have a criminal conviction; and  \n \nThis discharge may not be used to disqualify a person in any application for \nemployment or appointment to office in either the public or private sector. \n(Answer to the SOR) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant further testified that he did not deliberately or intentionally fail to disclose \nhis felony arrest, but honestly did not believe he was required to disclose it based on what \nhe had been previously been told.

(Tr. 39-40; AE M O, Q, R, S, U) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $135,572 that began \naccumulating in 2015 when his business was burned down by arsonists in a racially \nmotivated crime and he was unable to pay the accounts. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s successful business was destroyed, along with his assets to run the \nbusiness, when his building was intentionally set on fire by arsonists. The debts alleged \nin the SOR were business debts. Applicant has paid many debts not reflected in the SOR \nand he has resolved all but one debt in the SOR. The sole remaining debt, in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nis being paid through a payment plan. Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred for reasons \nbeyond his control and he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. Future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. He has participated in financial counseling and \nthere are clear indications his financial problems are under control. He has paid almost \nall of his delinquent debts and is in a payment plan for the remaining debt. All of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nI have considered all of the evidence and conclude that Applicant did not \ndeliberately fail to disclose in his SCA his delinquent debts. I found his explanation \ncredible that he did not believe he had to disclose his business debts, and he did not \ndeliberately fail to disclose the information. I also found his testimony credible that based \non the order from his state\u2019s court regarding his felony charge and what he was told by \nthe judge that he legitimately believed his felony charges did not need to be disclosed. I \nfind Applicant did not deliberately fail to provide information on his SCA that was required. \nI find in his favor on Guideline E, personal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant met his burden of persuasion. \nHe has paid most of his delinquent debts and has a payment plan for the remaining debt, \nand he rebutted the allegations of deliberate falsification. The record evidence leaves me \nwith no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations and refuted the Guideline E, personal conduct \nallegations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

From March 2013 to September 2013, he received \ntraining in electronics while in United States Navy Reserve (USNR). He has been \nmarried since February 2015 and has three stepchildren, 26, 23, and 14 years of age. \nThe 23-year-old still lives with Applicant and his wife. (GE 1 at 12; Tr. 30) \nSince February 2017, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. \nBefore his current employment, he worked at a national discount store and a pet store. \nHe has been in the USNR since January 2013, where he received advanced training \nthat qualified him for his current position. Applicant has held a security clearance since \nNovember 2015. (GE 1 at 13-21, 37; Tr. 28) \nApplicant indicated that his wife became seriously ill in July 2015. The illness \ncaused several of her internal organs to stop working. She was hospitalized for four \nweeks in July 2015, followed by various stages of care and recovery until October 2015. \nSince she had to stop working, the household went from two incomes to one, with \nApplicant shouldering all the financial responsibility. He was unable to keep abreast of \nthe bills. His wife still has some of the same lingering medical problems that her mother \nsuffered from and died recently. (GE 3, 4, 5, 7; Tr. 7, 32-34) \nAccording to his April 2020 PSI, before his wife became ill in 2015, Applicant \nclaimed that he paid his bills on time. In November 2016, the last time Applicant \nattempted to address the listed creditors, a bankruptcy firm advised him that they had \nreceived his final payment to allow them to file a bankruptcy petition. After he began \nworking for his current employer in February 2017, he had to discontinue the petition \nbecause he was earning too much income. He also claimed he was monitoring his \nfinancial obligations and discussing different payment options with the creditors. At the \nhearing, he testified that he never contacted any of the creditors. He was unable to \nexplain what the listed debts represented except for SOR \u00b6 1.m, a utility.

(GE 3 at 10) \nConcerning the issue of changes Applicant and his wife have made to avoid \nsimilar financial problems from reappearing in the future, he pointed to a change in his \n\u201cmindset.\u201d (Tr. 48) When the debts became delinquent back in 2015, Applicant was \ninexperienced in managing finances. He believed that his budget skills have improved, \nredirecting his focus on family needs and not wants. He explained that his budget is not \nin writing, but a verbal agreement between Applicant and his wife that encourages \nongoing discussions about his income and expenditures. He has a full-time career that \npays all the bills, rather than part-time employment. Even with the financial help from his \n23-year-old son and his mother, who moved into his residence in 2019, he has not \nbegun addressing the delinquent debts because he does not earn enough money. \nApplicant has never participated in financial counseling, but has read books on the \nsubject. (Tr. 45-50, 54) \nCharacter Evidence \nOn February 4, 2021, Mr. S stated by character reference that he has known \nApplicant since November 2018, when Mr. S became Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor. \nBased on his regular evaluations of Applicant\u2019s job performance, Mr. S considers him \nan honest and reliable person. He recommends Applicant for a security clearance \nbecause he knows of nothing in his professional or personal life that will prevent him \nfrom performing his responsibilities. (AE A) Mr. S did not address Applicant\u2019s financial \nissues. \nOn February 2, 2021, Mr. C submitted a character endorsement indicating \nthat Applicant has worked for him since February 2017. He is a conscientious employee \nwho achieves results in a timely and responsible manner. He is a dedicated family man, \nhaving spent his vacation hours at home caring for his sick wife.

(AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government credit reports \nestablish that the most of the debts listed in the SOR have been delinquent since \nbetween 2015 and 2017. Applicant\u2019s most recent documented attempt to resolve the \ndelinquent debts was in November 2016. Applicant has demonstrated by five years of \ninaction that he is unwilling to fix his financial indebtedness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies because Applicant has done nothing to address the \ndelinquent accounts since November 2016. Trying to distance himself from the listed \ndebts because of their age and the negative circumstances resulting in their creation \nsignals his unwillingness to resolve them. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes about $26,000 in \ndelinquent debt to 18 creditors or collection agencies. With no discernible changes in \nhis financial practices, they will probably persist in the future. Applicant\u2019s failure to take \ncharge of his delinquent debt responsibilities continues to raises doubts about his \nreliability and judgment. \nThe serious medical problems that Applicant\u2019s wife encountered in July 2015, \nrendering her unable to work and requiring a long period of medical treatment, acute \ncare, and recovery, were unforeseen conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control. The loss of \nher income and his part-time income until February 2017 had an adverse impact on his \nbill-paying ability. However, for the mitigating condition to fully applicable, an applicant \nmust provide credible documented evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Hence, Applicant \nshould have taken some action to contact and negotiate payment plans with the \ncreditors, or at least inform the creditors of his financial plight. \nThe lack of financial counseling or evidence of a written budget negates \napplicability of the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare not being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant is \nnot engaged in a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been married since 2015 and has three adult children, with one \nof his sons still living with him. He has been in the USNR since February 2013. He has \nbeen employed as an electronics technician since February 2017. I have considered the \nglowing comments of two supervisors and one coworker who are impressed with \nApplicant\u2019s job performance and productivity over the last four years. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that his delinquent \ndebts are being resolved or under control. Assuming that Applicant is relying on a \nlimitations statute to avoid responsibility for the SOR debt because it has been removed \nfrom his credit report and is no longer enforceable, the debt is still significant for security \nclearance purposes. See ISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016) \nRelying on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to eliminate \nfinancial troubles. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) In \nGuideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish his \ncase in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \nrepayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the \nSOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and has \ntaken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has no plan in place and \nfurnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on the past due accounts. After a full \nreview of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant\u2019s \nongoing financial problems have not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.s:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn May 8, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant timely submitted documents in response that are marked as Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A through H. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 9, 2022, and I reopened the record on \nMarch 10, 2022. Department Counsel and Applicant submitted additional documents that \nhave been marked as Item 5, and AE I through AE T. Other email communications have \nbeen marked as Hearing Exhibit 1. All items and exhibits are admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force \nfrom October 1998 to July 2013 and in the Air Force reserve until July 2015; he received \nan honorable discharge. He attended three universities, two colleges and a computer \nlearning center from 1995 to 1997, 2005 to 2009, and 2013 to 2015, and earned \nassociate\u2019s degrees in 2006 and 2008. He married in April 2012 and divorced in May \n2014. He has one son (age 19), and reported paying approximately $400 per month in \nchild support. He has worked as a senior system administrator since February 2018 and \nin various information technology positions since August 2013. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, totaling approximately $53,899, and that \napplicant falsified material facts in his security clearance application (SCA) by denying \nthat he had financial problems and failing to disclose the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR. Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 2.a, with \nexplanations. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g, with \nexplanations. (Item 1) \nApplicant reported no financial issues in his January 2020 SCA. He denied that, in \nthe previous seven years, he had defaulted on any type of loan, had debts placed for \ncollection, had any credit account charged off, or that he had been more than 120 days\u2019 \ndelinquent on any debt. He denied that he was utilizing or seeking assistance from a \ncredit counseling service or similar entity to resolve his financial difficulties, and also \ndenied that he was then over 120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt. (Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May and June 2020. \nDuring the May 2020 interview, he initially reported no adverse financial issues in the \nprevious seven years, and said that he paid his debts on time. After the investigator \nconfronted him with adverse financial information, Applicant acknowledged that he had \nexperienced financial difficulties since 2013. He attributed his financial issues to a \nreduction in income after his overseas military allowances ended when he returned to the \nUnited States, costs associated with transition from active military service, credit card \ndebt from the purchase of household items, child support, divorce costs, and financial \nsupport for his parents who had health issues. He admitted that he had not listed his \nfinancial difficulties in the SCA because those issues could negatively affect adjudication \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof his application. He reported an annual salary of $111,000; disposable income of $600 \nmonthly; a $3,200 emergency fund; and $43,000 in stocks. He said that he completed \ncourses on saving (2014) and investing (2019). (Item 3) \nThe evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: student loan collection accounts totaling $9,844 \n($5,027, $2,784, and $2,033 respectively). The May 2020 credit report reflects the \nstudent loans as in collection with balances of $4,758; $2,635; and $1,924, respectively. \nThe student loans accounts were opened from November 2013 to September 2015, and \nlater assigned to the Department of Education for collection. Applicant reported that in \n2016 the college he attended was investigated for deceptive practices and that the \nstudent loans were placed in forbearance. He said that in 2019, the Department of \nEducation informed him that he was not responsible for those loans, and that in May 2020, \nthe U.S. Treasury refunded payments he had made on those student loans. He admitted \neach allegation, reported the loans were discharged, and provided documentary evidence \nthat the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b had been discharged, and that the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b61.c had been settled. He said that he did not list these student loans in \nhis SCA because he thought that he was not responsible for them. These debts are \nresolved. (Item 1 at page 11, Item 3, Item 5 at pages 7-9; AE A, I, J, N, O) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b61.d and 1.e: collection account for $20,384, and charge account \ncharged off for $19,173. The May 2020 credit report reflects two accounts with the same \naccount number charged off by a creditor for $19,173 and closed in June 2014, and \nplaced for collection by a different creditor in June 2014, with an account balance of \n$20,384. Applicant reported the debt was a $15,000 personal loan that he obtained to \nassist with his financial difficulties and that he could not afford to make the required \npayments. He said that he did not report this debt in his SCA because he disputed the \naccount balance. He stated that the two debts alleged in the SOR were for the same debt \nand said that he would contact the creditor and set up a payment plan in June 2020. In \nresponse to the SOR, he denied both allegations, and has submitted documentary \nevidence that both accounts do not appear on recent credit reports. He provided no \ndocumentary evidence that he contacted the creditors, made payments on or otherwise \nresolved the debts. I find that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e, was acquired by a different \ncreditor and placed for collection as alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. When the same conduct is \nalleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR \u00b6 1.e in Applicant's favor on that basis. The account alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d \nhas not been resolved. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5; AE G, P, Q) \nSOR \u00b61.f: collection account for $2,408. The May 2020 credit report reflects an \naccount balance of $2,708, and that the debt was assigned for collection in 2015. \nApplicant reported that the account was a delinquent credit-card account, that he did not \nrecall when he last made a payment on the account, and that he would contact the creditor \nand make an immediate payment.

He provided \nno documentary evidence that he made payments under the payment plan, or otherwise \nresolved the debt. The debt has not been resolved. (Item 1 at page 12-13, Items 3, 4, 5; \nAE G, P, Q, T) \nSOR \u00b61.g: collection account for $1,052. The May 2020 credit report reflects \nthis account as assigned for collection in January 2020 with an account balance of $1,052. \nApplicant reported that he disputed the validity of the debt, stating that in 2013 a \ntelecommunications service provider charged him a fee for failing to return equipment \nthat he had returned. He said that he had submitted a receipt reflecting return of the \nequipment to the creditor. He did not list this account in his SCA because he disputed its \nvalidity. He said that he would contact the creditor in June 2020. He denied the allegation, \nand has submitted documentary evidence that the account has been removed from his \ncredit report. He provided documentary evidence reflecting resolution of a different debt \nwith a sister company that was also listed in the May 2020 credit report. He provided no \ndocumentary evidence that he contacted the creditor, disputed, made payments on, or \notherwise resolved this debt. The debt has not been resolved.

The May 2020 credit report \nreflects this account as charged off in July 2014. Applicant said that he made payments \non the account until 2014, but stopped making payments because he disputed a charge. \nHe said that he did not disclose this debt in his SCA because he disputed the amount and \nhoped to resolve the matter. He admitted the allegation and provided documentary \nevidence that the account had been removed from his credit report. He provided no \ndocumentary evidence that he contacted the creditor, disputed or made payments on the \ndebt, or resolved this debt. The debt has not been resolved. (Items 3, 4; AE G, P, Q) \nSOR \u00b61.i: credit account charged off for $231. The May 2020 credit report \nreflects this account as charged off for $231. Applicant reported that this debt was for \nunauthorized charges in 2014. He reported that the credit union could not determine who \nhad made the disputed charge. He said that he did not list this account in his SCA \nbecause the investigation was inconclusive and he did not think that he needed to make \npayment on the account. He admitted the allegation and provided documentary evidence \nthat the account had been removed from his credit report. He provided no documentary \nevidence that he contacted the creditor, disputed, or otherwise resolved the debt. The \ndebt has not been resolved. (Items 3, 4; AE G, P) \nApplicant admitted that he intentionally falsified material facts in his January 2020 \nSCA regarding his financial account delinquencies and deliberately failed to disclose the \ndelinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.i, because he feared truthful responses would \nhurt his chances of retaining a security clearance.

He noted that he received four medals for performance in \nthe Air Force, was selected as Noncommissioned Officer of the Month and Quarter, and \nhad been recognized as a member of the Weapons Load Crew of the Year. He requested \nforgiveness for his lack of candor and a second chance. (Item 1) \nThe record includes documentary evidence that Applicant worked with a credit \nrepair service, and resolved a number debts not alleged in the SOR. Recent credit records \nprovided by Applicant reflect only three delinquent accounts, none of which were alleged \nin the SOR. He did not provide documentary evidence of his current financial budget, \nsavings or disposable income. Any derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not \nbe considered for disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the \napplication of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis. (Items 1, 5; AE B, C, \nD, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government must present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security clearance decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish that he has a history of \nfinancial problems dating back to 2013. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant incurred the debts alleged in the SOR totaling approximately $53,899 \nfrom 2013 through May 2020. He provided documentary evidence that the student loan \ndebts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, totaling $9,844, were discharged or settled by \nthe Department of Education because the school he attended had engaged in deceptive \npractices. I have also found that the $19,173 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e duplicates the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d, and resolved SOR \u00b6 1.e in his favor. \nApplicant provided documentary evidence that the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, totaling approximately $24,882, do not appear on recent credit \nreports. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd.

However, he did not provide sufficient \nevidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant presented evidence that he worked \nwith a credit repair service, and claimed that he had taken courses on investing and \nsaving. However, he failed to provide sufficient evidence that he received financial \ncounseling or has a budget, and he presented insufficient evidence that the debts alleged \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i were being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. The debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and\n1.e have been resolved. Applicant provided evidence of a payment plan to resolve the \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f, but submitted no evidence that he complied with that \nagreement. An important element of good faith and responsible conduct is maintaining \ncontact with creditors. He provided no documentary evidence that he has contacted the \ncreditors or otherwise resolved the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.  \n \nAG 20(e) is not established. Applicant averred that he disputed several of the debts \nalleged in the SOR, but submitted no documentary evidence in support of his assertions, \nor of actions he has taken to resolve those issues. \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has good intentions, but \nhis good intentions have not yet evolved into a reasonable and credible plan that includes \nthe debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his financial problems in \nhis SCA because he feared that his financial delinquencies would negatively impact \nadjudication of his security clearance. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling  \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6I\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not apply. Applicant intentionally falsified material \nfacts in his January 2020 SCA by denying that he had financial problems and failing to \ndisclose the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Four months later he told a Government \ninvestigator that he had no financial problems and paid his debts on time. He \nacknowledged his financial problems only after the investigator confronted him with \nadverse credit information reflecting delinquent accounts from 2013 to 2020. He has since \nadmitted that he was dishonest because he did not want his financial problems to \nnegatively impact adjudication of his security clearance. Although he has acknowledged \nhis misconduct, he has presented insufficient evidence of other positive steps taken to \nchange his behavior, or that the behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAn act of falsification has security significance independent of any significance of \nthe underlying conduct. ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). The \nmitigation of the underlying conduct has little bearing on the security significance of the \nfalsification. ISCR Case No. 08-11944 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2011) (citations omitted). \nIt is foreseeable that an applicant who fails to answer security clearance application \nquestions according to their reasonable and accepted meanings may well fail to disclose \nother significant matters that should be brought to the attention of the Government, which \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis a requirement of those who have access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-\n08163 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 45 years old, served approximately 17 years in the \nAir Force and received multiple awards and recognition for his service including four \nmedals. I also considered that he has worked in various information technology positions \nsince leaving active duty in 2013 including as a senior system administrator since \nFebruary 2018. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant's \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

An investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterviewed him on February 26, 2020. After reviewing the information gathered during \nthe background investigation, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) on April 9, 2021. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23 and 28, 2021, submitted documents in \nmitigation, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge with the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe case was originally assigned to two other administrative judges.

Based on the documents received, on \nApril 25, 2022, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following \ntwo paragraphs: \n\u201c1.f: You are indebted to the IRS in the approximate amount of $45,390 for \ndelinquent taxes for tax years 2012 \u2013 2015, and 2017 \u2013 2019.

He has a 15-year-old daughter for whom he provides financial support. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history, as disclosed in his 2020 SCA, is difficult to follow, \nappears to have conflicting employments, and contains several unaccounted periods. He \nwas self-employed as an investigator (part-time) for two employers between July 2002 \nand December 2007, while at the same time working full-time as an investigator for a \nfederal agency. He was employed full-time by a federal contractor as a residential sales \nrepresentative from December 2003 to April 2005. A federal contractor employed him \nbetween August 2007 and November 2007 as a full-time security officer. He was \nunemployed from December 2007 to December 2008. He provided no explanation or \nreason for this period of unemployment. \nA federal agency employed Applicant as a paralegal from December 2008 to July \n2013. He received eligibility for a top-secret clearance in 2013, which was renewed until \nthe DCSA CAF revoked his clearance in April 2021. He worked for a federal contractor \nbetween July and September 2013, but was terminated when he failed his training. He \nwas unemployed from September to December 2013. He failed to indicate his status from \nJanuary 2014 to April 2016. A federal contractor employed Applicant from April 2016 to \nNovember 2017, when he was terminated for failure to perform. He worked full-time for a \nfederal contractor from November 2017 to December 2019, while at the same time doing \npart-time work for a second federal contractor. His annual income during that time was \n$87,000. (GE 1; Tr. 42-43) In December 2019, the contract ended and he was laid off. \nApplicant was unemployed until June 2020, when his current employer and clearance \nsponsor hired him. His current annual salary is $80,000. (Tr. 36; 42-43) He has about \n$1,000 in both his savings and checking accounts. He has about $3,300 in his 401K \nretirement account.

He claimed that at an undisclosed date, he \nentered into a payment plan with the IRS to pay $120 monthly, but he failed to make the \npayments. (At hearing, he acknowledged this was not true.) He also claimed he paid \n$1,100 to a tax preparation company to help him file his taxes, but the company \ndisappeared. (GE 1; Tr. 31, 32) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he failed to file Federal and state \nincome tax returns for TY 2014 through 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He hired an accountant to help \nhim file his delinquent tax returns for TY 2014 - 2019 in February 2020. He claimed he \nhad established a payment agreement with the IRS. During his testimony, he \nacknowledged he did not have a payment agreement established with the IRS when he \nanswered the SOR or at the time of his hearing. (Tr. 80 \u2013 81) \nApplicant testified that he filed his income tax returns for TY 2013 to 2019 in \nFebruary 2020. (Tr. 66 - 70) Documentary evidence shows he filed his income tax returns \nfor TY 2017 and 2018 on February 27, 2020; for TY 2019 on February 28, 2020; and for \nTY 2020 on October 15, 2021. The IRS noted that he requested an extension to file his \nTY 2020 tax return on May 4, 2021. (See AE 3) Applicant highlighted that he timely filed \nhis income tax returns for TY 2020 and 2021. (Tr. 33) He presented no evidence to show \nthe IRS granted him extensions to file his tax returns, except for TY 2020. \nThe IRS assigned Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax obligation to a collection agency on \nMay 21, 2021. Documentary evidence shows he owes the IRS $45,388 in delinquent \ntaxes for TY 2012 to 2015 and 2017 to 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) (AE 3) He testified that he owes \nthe IRS an additional $1,000 for his TY 2021 income taxes, thus his total debt to the IRS \ntotals $46,388. (Tr. 80 - 81) \nApplicant hired a tax relief company to help him with his income tax problems on \nApril 21, 2022. (AE 6) Apparently, he was not satisfied with it. He hired a second company \n(CT) on May 26, 2022. (AE 9) At hearing, he testified he was working with CT to establish \na payment plan with the IRS. (Tr. 73 - 74) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a statement \nfrom CT, dated May 31, 2022, indicating the company was in the process of contacting \nthe IRS to bring his account into full compliance, amending a tax return, and negotiating \na resolution for the balances. (AE 11) Applicant testified that he had previously entered \ninto a payment agreement with the IRS (date undisclosed), and made several payments \nof $120 a month. When confronted in cross-examination, he acknowledged he did not \nhave a payment agreement established with the IRS when he answered the SOR or at \nthe time of his hearing.

(SOR \u00b6 1.b) He explained that he was laid off in 2013, \nand did not have the money to pay the car. He surrendered the car to the creditor. He \nclaimed he established a payment arrangement to pay $125 per month. He did not \npresent documentary evidence of the payment agreement. However, he presented \ndocumentary evidence of a $632.95 payment made in March 2022. (AE 5; Tr. 32-33) He \ndid not present evidence of any other payments made before or after his March 2022 \npayment. \nApplicant denied he was $4,407 delinquent in his child support. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) In \nNovember 2015, he was in arrears for $8,688. He explained he was unemployed and \ncould not afford to make the payments. (Tr. 40) The family court did not find him in \ncontempt of court for failure to make the payments. (AE 7) He has been making his child \nsupport payments as required since he found work in 2015, and is current on his \npayments. (See AE 8) He stated he has an arrearage balance of $2,400. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant admitted he owes $474 to a credit union for \noverdraft fees when he was unemployed. The account was charged off. Prior to the \nhearing, he claimed he had established a $25 a month payment arrangement. He did not \npresent documentary evidence of the payment arrangement. His documentary evidence \nshows he made a $110 payment in March 2022, and a $60 payment in April 2022. He \nclaimed he has been making payments well before and after he received the SOR. He \npresented no documentary evidence to support his claims. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged and Applicant admitted that he owes his state $9,661 for \ndelinquent taxes. On January 31, 2022, Applicant established a payment plan with his \nstate, promising to pay $310 monthly. He made two payments in January 2022, one in \nMarch 2022, and one in April 2022. (AE 4; Tr. 83) \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of efforts to file his delinquent \nincome tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2019, until 2020. In February 2020, he retained \nthe services of a tax relief company seeking help to file past-due tax returns and resolve \nhis tax debt. His documentary evidence shows that the tax relief company he retained \nfiled his TYs 2014 to 2019 income tax returns on February 2020. (AE 7) \nAccording to IRS regulations, in 2012, a person making over $9,750 gross income \nhad to file an income tax return, and in 2021, the filing threshold was $12,550 gross \nincome. Applicant did not present documentary evidence to show he was below the IRS \nfiling threshold for the years in question. \nApplicant acknowledged that he has made mistakes in the past concerning his \nfinances, but he is trying to correct them. He believes that if he is granted clearance \neligibility, he will be able to resolve all of his financial problems.

His intent is to continue filing his tax returns on time and paying his taxes. \nHe is looking forward to establishing a payment plan with the IRS, and promised to make \nhis payments on time and to pay his delinquent taxes. \nApplicant promised to be financially responsible in the future. He testified that he \nis following a budget and he has received financial counseling through his tax relief \ncompany. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nApplicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for TY 2014 \nthrough 2019. He filed his tax returns for TY 2014 through 2019 in February 2020. He \nowes the IRS $45,390 for delinquent taxes for TY 2012 to 2015 and 2017 to 2019. As of \nhis hearing date, he did not have a payment agreement, although he was working on it. \nHe presented no documentary evidence of efforts to file his delinquent income tax returns \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbefore 2020. He presented no documentary evidence of efforts to pay or make payment \nagreements with the IRS or the state since he accrued the delinquent taxes until 2020. \nAdditionally, he is past due $2,409, on an $8,867 balance, for a repossessed car; owes \n$2,400 in arrears in child support; and over $300 on a charged-off account to a credit \nunion. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce; having to change his \nincome tax filing status during the marital separation and after his divorce, which \nincreased his tax liability; not knowing how to file his tax returns as an independent \ncontractor; and his periods of unemployment and underemployment that made his \nfinancial situation difficult. \nI have considered as circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control his divorce and his \nunemployment and underemployment. These circumstances could have adversely \naffected his ability to timely file his income tax returns, albeit for a short period, or \naggravated his financial situation. I do not find his lack of knowledge to file his tax returns \nas an independent contractor a circumstance beyond his control. The IRS, legal services \non military bases, financial institutions, and accountants assist taxpayers filing their taxes. \nHe presented no documentary evidence he sought help to file his income tax returns until \n2020. I note that Applicant\u2019s divorce was in 2017, but he failed to file tax returns for TYs \n2013 to 2019. He testified that he failed to file tax returns for TY 2013 because he did not \nhave the money to pay his taxes after he changed in filing status. Apparently, he did not \nfile the following years because he was afraid of the penalties and interest he would owe \nfor his failure to timely file and to pay his taxes. \nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 to 2019 in 2020, after \nhe submitted his 2019 SCA. He took no action to pay his delinquent state taxes until \nJanuary 2022, and he is still working on a payment plan with the IRS to pay his delinquent \ntaxes. Additionally, Applicant claimed in his answer to the SOR that he had established \npayment agreements with the IRS and with the creditors of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.e. At hearing, he admitted he lied about having a payment agreement with the \nIRS, and he failed to present documentary evidence to corroborate his claims of payment \nagreements. I gave him credit for making some payments to the creditors of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.e, but he made the payments after he received the SOR. I also note that the amount \nof the payments he made do not match the amounts of the monthly payment agreements \nhe claimed he had established. His evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been \nfinancially responsible under the circumstances.  \nApplicant disclosed his tax problems in his 2020 SCA. Because of his military \nservice and years working for federal contractors and holding a clearance since 2013, \nApplicant knew or should have known of the security concerns raised by his failure to \ntimely file income tax returns and to pay his taxes. Notwithstanding, he did nothing to file \nhis delinquent federal income tax returns until 2020, and as of May 2022, has not \nestablished a payment plan with the IRS to pay his delinquent taxes. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbout the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA \nAppeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant has a problem complying with \ngovernment rules, regulations, and systems. He failed to establish full mitigation of the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. I am unable to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to timely file his \nincome tax returns or pay his taxes. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of \nwhether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 63, seeks the continuation of his clearance eligibility. The evidence \nagainst grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. He failed to timely file federal \nand state income tax returns for many years, and he failed to pay delinquent federal taxes. \nHis financial problems are recent and not under control. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nApplicant knew that he needed to file his federal and state income tax returns and \npay his income taxes. Whether or not he knew he was going to receive refunds or had \nsufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, he had a legal requirement to timely file his tax \nreturns. He did not fully understand or appreciate the importance of timely filing of tax \nreturns in security clearance determinations. His promises of future financial responsibility \nare insufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Moreover, \nhis false statements in his 2020 SCA and his false testimony raise serious concerns about \nhis honesty, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, \n  and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

Applicant timely \nresponded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn August 9, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.

The government was on notice of Applicant\u2019s \n1995 and 2000 DUI arrests. (Tr. 20-22. 45-46; Gov 2, Section 22 at 33-34) \nApplicant found the e-QIP security clearance applications in 2019 and 2020 \nconfusing. He never intended to falsify his security clearance applications. He listed his \n2018 DUI offense in response to section 22 on both his 2019 and 2020 security clearance \napplications. He did not list his 2011 DUI on either application. This coincides with \nApplicant\u2019s mistaken belief that he did not have to list alcohol offenses that were more \nthan seven years old on his 2019 and his 2020 security clearance applications. I find SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b for Applicant because he did not intend to deliberately withhold these \noffenses from the government. He misunderstood the question. (Tr. 21-22) \nCharacter Evidence \nMr. D.A. wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has known Applicant for over 11 \nyears. He works with Applicant and also socializes with him outside of work. He states \nApplicant cares about doing the job correctly. Mr. D.A. understands the importance of \nnational security. He believes Applicant is a valuable asset with knowledge, skill, and a \nwork ethic that is tough to find. (AE B at 1) \nThe Principal of Logistics, at Applicant\u2019s employer states that Applicant has \ndemonstrated an ability to go above and beyond his required duties for the past 12 years \nas an employee.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) apply. Between July 1995 and May 2021, Applicant was \narrested on five occasions for alcohol-related driving incidents involving the police and \nthe courts. He was convicted of four DUIs in July 1995, October 2000, September 2018, \nand May 2021. He was convicted for DWI in April 2011. He has a history of habitual \nalcohol consumption to the point of impaired judgment which resulted in five alcohol-\nrelated arrests over a 16-year-period. \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nI find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long history of drunk \ndriving offenses, with his most recent arrest for DUI occurring in May 2021, after the SOR \nwas issued. While there is no evidence that Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol \ndisorder, he has long history of drinking and driving while intoxicated. Between 1995 to \n2021, he incurred five DUI and DWI convictions. He attended court-ordered counseling, \nbut does not seem to comprehend the gravity of the situation. He continues to drink \nalcohol, but relies on friends or a ride-sharing service on nights when he drinks alcohol. \nDespite his assertions, I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s extremely poor judgment to \ndrive while under the influence of alcohol is safely in the past. His long history of alcohol-\nrelated driving offenses casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAlcohol consumption security concerns are not mitigated. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d; and \u201c(b) evidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant was arrested for DWI in April 2011 and for DUI in July 1995, October \n2000, September 2018, and May 2021. In May 2002, he was arrested for operating a \nvehicle with a suspended license. These misdemeanor-level offenses are serious in that \nthey entailed a risk of death, bodily injury, and property damage to Applicant and other \ndrivers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of the Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long \nhistory of alcohol-related offenses. His most recent arrest for DWI occurred three months \nafter the SOR was issued. He still drinks alcohol on a weekly basis. While he states that \nhe no longer drinks and drives, concerns remain due to his lengthy history of alcohol-\nrelated arrests and his history of demonstrated poor judgment of driving home after \ndrinking alcohol. In May 2002, Applicant defied the court\u2019s order and drove while on a \nsuspended license.  Considering his history of alcohol-related driving offenses and the \nrecency of his last DUI arrest in May 2021, it is too soon to conclude the concerns under \nCriminal Conduct are mitigated.    \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately omitted his arrests for DUI in July 1995, \nOctober 2000, and arrest for DWI in April 2011, in response to Section 22 on his 2019 \nand 2020 security clearance applications. Applicant listed his 1995 and 2000 DUI arrests \non a security clearance application he completed in June 2009. He testified that he \nmisread the questions in Section 22 of on his February 2019 and August 2020 security \nclearance applications. He believed he only needed to disclose alcohol-related offenses \nthat occurred within seven years before completing the security clearance application. He \nlisted his September 2018 DWI on both the 2019 and 2020 security clearance \napplications because it was within the seven-year timeframe. The July 1995, October \n2000, and April 2011 DWI and DUIs occurred more than seven years before he completed \nhis SCA. I find Applicant\u2019s explanations credible. He disclosed his 2018 DUI on both the \n2019 and 2020 security clearance applications. This was the most recent DUI at the time \nApplicant completed both applications. He disclosed his July 1995 and October 2000 DUI \narrests on a previous security clearance application in June 2009. He put the government \non notice about his multiple alcohol-related driving offenses. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee working for a defense contractor. I considered \nhe is a high school graduate with some college credit. I considered his service in the Navy \nfrom March 1986 to April 2009. He retired with an Honorable Discharge at the rate of \nsenior chief (E-8). I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable references and his awards and \ndecorations earned during his service in the Navy. \nI find the allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. He \nmisread the questions on his 2019 and 2020 security clearance applications. He did not \nintentionally omit his 1995, 2000 and 2011 alcohol-related arrests on these applications. \nDespite these favorable factors, security concerns remain under the Alcohol \nConsumption and Criminal Conduct concerns because of Applicant\u2019s long history of \nalcohol-related driving offenses with his most recent DUI arrest occurring after the SOR \nwas issued. Not enough time has passed to determine whether Applicant will successfully \navoid future alcohol-related offenses. Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.b: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

She also \nadmitted that she made some bad financial decisions when she helped finance vehicles \nfor an ex-husband who let the loans go delinquent. (Tr. at 23-27; A1 and attachments \n(listed by Applicant as Items and Exhibits)) \nApplicant documented that she earns over $160,000 per year from her current job, \nand she also testified that she is working a second IT job, which also pays her \napproximately $160,000 per year as well.

Applicant documented \nthat she paid this debt in June 2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 28; A1 (Item Q)) \nRegarding the ASOR allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.r) that in May 2017, Applicant was \nremoved from her BD position of her company by the other BD members, Applicant \ndenied that she was properly removed by the BD because it had no authority to do so. \nApplicant was in a legal dispute with the other BD members over several things, including \nher being reimbursed for IT work she performed for the company, of which she was a 33 \npercent owner. Applicant, with the consent of the company CEO, wrote herself three \nchecks (in January, February, and March 2017) totaling $7,050 as payment for her IT \nservices she rendered to the company. In May the BD issued a resolution that Applicant \nwas to be removed as a BD member and that charges would be filed against Applicant \nfor embezzlement. The BD made a formal complaint to the local police department and a \npolice report was issued. No criminal charges were ever filed against Applicant. \nAdditionally, she intervened in a pending civil lawsuit brought by another former company \nemployee against the company and the other BD members (except Applicant) seeking \nsummary judgment against the BD for its improper removal of her as a BD member. She \nsought to have the BD\u2019s removal action declared null and void. In February 2018, the \njudge granted the motion and declared the BD\u2019s action in removing Applicant from the BD \nwas without proper authority and therefore \u201cnull and void.\u201d Applicant remained a member \nof the BD. (Tr. at 31, 34-35; AE 12-13; AE B13-35, B39-42) \nGuideline E \nThe relevant facts underlying SOR \u00b6 2.a are stated above and will not be restated \nhere. Applicant stated that in response to the Section 13A allegation that she falsified her \nApril 2019 SCA regarding being fired or let go for cause from her employment, her answer \nwas correct because she remained a BD member after the judge\u2019s ruling which nullified \nthe BDs action of removing her. Therefore, her SCA response to Section 13A was not \nfalse or deliberately misleading. (Tr. at 35; AE B18-20) \nApplicant admitted that she failed to document on her April 2019 SCA that she was \na party to a civil lawsuit. She stated that it was an oversight and not intentional. A review \nof her April 2019 SCA, Section 13A, shows that when she described her relationship with \nthe company with whom she was a named party in a civil lawsuit, she stated \u201cI did hire a \nlawyer to collect my ownership interest.\u201d In her July 2017 background interview with an \ninvestigator, Applicant voluntarily disclosed her contentious relationship with her \ncompany\u2019s former CEO and stated that she was getting an attorney to file against the \nCEO to get her share of the company. She also voluntarily disclosed the lawsuit during \nher more recent background investigation in August 2019. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant incurred medical and consumer debts over a period of time. She was \nalso accused of embezzling money from a business concern where she was part-owner \nand wrote checks to reimburse herself for work she performed. Her actions were \nvindicated by a judge\u2019s order granting her motion for summary judgment and concluding \nthat there was no basis to remove her from the BD. I find the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised, except that AG \u00b6 20(d) is not raised regarding SOR \u00b6 1.r. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s medical issues contributed to her financial problems. Additionally, it \nwas not the wisest action to help finance her ex-husband\u2019s vehicles. Although the divorce \ncourt ultimately put the financial responsibility for those vehicles on her ex-husband, the \ndebts affected her financial status. As for the remaining debts, she has either paid the \ndebts or disputed them for valid reasons. All of her payments were before the issuance \nof the SOR in this case, thus showing responsible action and good faith. Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial status, based upon her two jobs where she earns a combined annual \nincome of $360,000, is such that it is unlikely that she will be placed in this position in the \nfuture. All the above mitigating conditions have some applicability. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nNone of the listed disqualifying conditions provide a basis for SOR \u00b6 2.a, since \nGuideline F provides a specific guideline for the alleged embezzlement allegation making \nAG \u00b6 16(d) not applicable. Additionally, there are no other Guidelines at play under these \nfacts also making AG \u00b6 16(c) not applicable. Nevertheless, under the general guidance \nof AG \u00b6 15, Applicant\u2019s action can be viewed as it may relate to her judgment and honesty. \nHowever, the facts established that Applicant was successful in court in having the BD\u2019s \ndecision to remove her from the BD declared null and void. Since the BD\u2019s removal action \nwas based upon its claim that Applicant embezzled company funds, the court\u2019s ruling \nthoroughly undercuts that basis and Applicant was never charged with any criminal \noffense. The general concern stated in AG \u00b6 15 also does not apply, it is therefore \nunnecessary to explore the applicability of any mitigating conditions. \nThe Government failed to establish that Applicant deliberately falsified or provided \nmisleading answers on her 2019 SCA as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to Section 13A provided detailed information about her leaving that company. \nAdditionally, based upon the court\u2019s ruling on Applicant\u2019s motion for partial summary \njudgment, Applicant remained a member of the company\u2019s BD and therefore none of the \nconditions existed which would require Applicant to answer the question listed in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b in an affirmative way. Likewise, while Applicant admitted not correctly answering the \nquestion in section 28 of her 2019 SCA, she credibly stated that this omission was an \nunintentional oversight rather than a deliberate attempt to withhold information. Evidence \nin the record supports Applicant\u2019s position. She disclosed in an earlier background \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninterview in 2017 the notion that she was going to court over the issue with the company\u2019s \nBD. In her 2019 SCA, in section 13A, she disclosed the contentious relationship and that \nshe had hired an attorney to protect her interests. During her 2019 background interview, \nshe voluntarily described the nature of the relationship that wound up in civil litigation. \nThese are not the actions of someone trying to keep this information from the government. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. Because no deliberate falsification was \nestablished, it is unnecessary to explore the applicability of any mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, the circumstances surrounding her \nindebtedness, her efforts to repay the delinquent debts, and the divorce court\u2019s allocation \nof some of the SOR debts to her ex-husband. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns and that personal conduct concerns were not \nestablished. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 2.a \u2013 1cr:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 42 years old. He and his first wife married in 2006 and divorced in April 2018. He and his first wife have a daughter, age 14. He also has a 20-year-old daughter from a prior relationship. He remarried in 2020, and he and his wife have a young daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 37, 49-51) Applicant held a clearance about 15-20 years ago when he was in the Army Reserve (2000-2006). He was never activated for a deployment, and he was discharged honorably. (Tr. 10, 68-70; GE 1) 2 Applicant has an associate\u2019s degree. He has worked as a federal contractor, for different employers, with limited interruption since mid-2009. He was terminated from one position in August 2018 for alleged poor performance. After about seven months of unemployment, he was hired by his current employer, another contractor for the same government agency, in March 2019. (GE 1) He earned a recent promotion and now earns an annual salary of $110,000.

The DOHA Hearing Office received the case on February 22, 2022, \nand the case was assigned to me on September 8, 2022. On September 30, 2022, \nDOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for October 19, 2022, by video-\nteleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through Q. All of the exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. After the hearing, I held the record open until November 2, 2022, to provide \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional information. He initially did not submit any \ndocuments by the deadline, and the record closed. However, on November 28, 2022, \nApplicant submitted four additional documents for consideration, along with a statement \nby e-mail. Department Counsel offered no objection, so the e-mail from Applicant (AE \nR) and the four documents (two character-reference letters, AE S and AE T, and two \ndocuments relating to child custody and his divorce, AE U and AE V) are admitted \nwithout objection.

He and his first wife married in 2006 and divorced in \nApril 2018. He and his first wife have a daughter, age 14. He also has a 20-year-old \ndaughter from a prior relationship. He remarried in 2020, and he and his wife have a \nyoung daughter. (GE 1; Tr. 37, 49-51) Applicant held a clearance about 15-20 years \nago when he was in the Army Reserve (2000-2006).

He has worked as a federal contractor, for \ndifferent employers, with limited interruption since mid-2009. He was terminated from \none position in August 2018 for alleged poor performance. After about seven months of \nunemployment, he was hired by his current employer, another contractor for the same \ngovernment agency, in March 2019. (GE 1) He earned a recent promotion and now \nearns an annual salary of $110,000. (Tr. 65-69; GE 1; AE K) \nThe SOR concerns several years of late-filed state and federal income tax \nreturns, and a single charged-off debt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) Applicant admitted both \nallegations in his SOR response, with explanations. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges, and Applicant admits, that he failed to timely file his state \nand federal income tax returns on time, as required, for \u201cat least\u201d tax years 2015-2019. \nApplicant disclosed on his June 2019 SCA that he had two years of unfiled tax returns \n(2017 and 2018). He said he could not afford to pay his 2017 taxes and noted his recent \nunemployment. (GE 1) He discussed his tax-filing issues and the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nduring his August 2019 background interview. (GE 2 at 5-6) \nApplicant testified that he had a difficult relationship with his first wife. During the \ntax periods at issue in this case, they were married but had been living separately, since\nabout 2014. Applicant said he prepared his returns each year but acknowledged that his\nrationale for not filing his tax returns was to \u201cprotect myself as much as I could \nfinancially\u201d because he did not want his wife to get his refunds. He acknowledged during\nhis testimony that this was not a good decision. He also acknowledged that once his \ntax-filing issues began, it was difficult to dig himself out. (Tr. 39-49, 55-57; GE 3 at 22-\n23)  \n \n \n \nDuring his hearing, Applicant was initially reluctant to discuss the circumstances \nof the end of his first marriage in much detail. (Tr. 40) After the hearing, in late \nNovember 2022, he provided additional details in an e-mail. (AE R) Essentially, he \nstated that there came a point in time when he and his first wife had a significant \ndisagreement about his efforts to resolve a custody dispute with the mother of his eldest \ndaughter, in about 2011. Though the parties participated in family counseling and found \nit helpful, the dispute also led to the end of their marriage. Applicant was reluctant to \ndiscuss the matter more fully in the hearing because it is painful and embarrassing. (AE \nR; AE U) As of September 2022, Applicant no longer has child-support obligations as to \nhis eldest daughter. (AE J) He pays child support for his middle child. (Tr. 51) \nApplicant filed his federal tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 at \nthe same time, in February 2021. For each year, he received a tax credit of several \nhundred dollars. (AE B) He acknowledged that he was prompted to address his tax \nreturns by the DOHA interrogatory he received in January 2021. (Tr. 60) He filed most \nof his remaining unfiled federal returns in December 2021. This included the federal \nreturns for 2017 ($1,165 credit), 2018 ($1,650 refund), and 2020 ($1,912 credit). He \nfiled his 2019 federal return in February 2022, and received a $3,273 refund.

(AE P. AE Q). He filed those returns in December 2020. (GE 3 at 15) He also \ndocumented that his state 2 income tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019 were also \nfiled, concurrently with his federal returns for those years. (Tr. 48) He was to receive \nrefunds of between $100 and $260 for each tax year. (AE C, AE D, AE E) His 2020 \nreturn reflects that he owed about $500 (AE G), but he testified that he received a \nrefund of less than $100. (Tr. 58) He has no other unfiled tax returns from prior years, \nand no outstanding state or federal tax debt. (Tr. 55, 58) \nApplicant has also filed his state and federal income tax returns for 2021. He \nreceived a federal refund of $3,688 and a state B tax refund of $2,459. (AE B, AE F, AE \nH) He apologized for his actions and now has a better understanding of his \nresponsibility as a citizen to file his tax returns on time, and he intends to do so in the \nfuture. (Tr. 49, 63-65, 73-74) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($32,532) is an account that was charged off by a credit union. (GE \nXX) Applicant admitted the debt, and it is listed as charged off on credit reports in the\nrecord. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5). The debt is a repossessed vehicle purchased during\nApplicant\u2019s first marriage. The April 2018 Final Order of Divorce notes, in part, that his\nwife (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) \u201cshall be solely responsible for all expenses related to the vehicle and\nshall hold Defendant (Applicant) harmless thereon.\u201d (AE M, AE V; Tr. 26, 30-33) \n \n \n \n \nThe vehicle was sold at auction in November 2018 for about $10,286, leaving an \noutstanding debt of $22,062. (AE O) Even though Applicant\u2019s former wife was \nresponsible for the vehicle and the debt following their divorce, he said she had not \ndone so. Although the debt is her responsibility as noted in the divorce decree, he has \nset up a payment plan to address the debt. He provided documentation at his 2019 \nbackground interview (GE 6) and updated it at his hearing. (AE A, AE M, AE N, AE O) \nApplicant has been making $100 monthly payments towards the account since late \n2019, and the balance owed as of late September 2022 is down to $18,366. (AE N) He \nexpects to continue making payments on the account. (Tr. 30-36) \nApplicant and his wife also recently sold their prior residence, a condominium, for \n$265,000, which was $16,000 over the asking price. While settlement was pending at \nthe time of the hearing, Applicant testified that he expected to use the proceeds from \nthe sale to address the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b. (AE L; Tr. 36-39) Applicant documented that \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is not his responsibility, but he is nonetheless addressing the debt \nresponsibly and has a reasonable plan for its resolution. Applicant has no other \ndelinquencies alleged. (GE 3; AE I) \nApplicant attested to his pride and dedication to serving his country in uniform \nand his desire to continue to do so in his current role. He has worked hard to get where \nhe is. He approaches his professional role and his role as a husband and father with \nutmost integrity.

He maintains a \u201ccool head\u201d under stress. He \nhas respect for protection of sensitive and classified information. He is honest and \ntrustworthy. He is also a veteran who wants to continue serving his country. There is no \nreason to question his character or judgment and they recommend him for a clearance. \n(AE S, AE T) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \nThe sole delinquent debt in the SOR, at \u00b6 1.b, is established by its reference on \ncredit reports in the record, and by Applicant\u2019s admission to the allegation. The \nGovernment therefore established a prime facie case as to that debt under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). (Despite this, Applicant also established that the debt is his ex-wife\u2019s \nresponsibility, as noted in the mitigation section, below).  \nApplicant had a duty to file his annual state and Federal income tax returns in a \ntimely manner, and the fact that he did not do so for several years is a security concern. \nAs the Appeal Board has held, in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, \n2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for several \ntax years, including 2015-2019, as alleged. This establishes AG \u00b6 19(f) specifically, as \nwell as, more generally, AG \u00b6 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax\nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements.  \n \n \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues began during the breakup of his marriage. With what he \nnow recognizes was a misguided rationale, Applicant chose for several years not to file \nhis state and federal income tax returns while he and his wife were separated, out of his \nconcern that she would capture his (generally rather limited) tax refunds. This continued \nuntil shortly after their divorce was finalized in 2018. Later tax-filing issues were due \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmore to Applicant\u2019s brief unemployment and a misunderstanding of his tax-filing \nresponsibilities as a citizen. \nApplicant was admittedly prompted to address his tax filings by the interrogatory \nhe received from DOHA in early 2021. He filed most of his remaining returns by the end \nof the year, and all of his past-due returns have now been filed, along with his most \nrecent returns, for TY 2021. Applicant had little to no resulting tax debt. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s tax issues began during the breakup of his marriage, he did not \nact responsibly by failing to file his tax returns in a misguided attempt to keep any \nrefunds from his wife. His tax issues were also not resolved until some time after his \ndivorce. \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s responsibility under the circumstances, I must consider \nthe timing of Applicant\u2019s actions. The Appeal Board has consistently held that timing of \nan applicant\u2019s resolution of his tax-filing problems is relevant in evaluating mitigation. An \napplicant who resolves financial or tax problems only when his clearance might be \nimperiled raises questions about his willingness to follow the sometimes complex rules \ngoverning classified information when his personal interests are not at stake. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). The Appeal Board has also held that \nan applicant cannot simply adopt a position of \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d or \u201call\u2019s well that ends \nwell.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Given the timing \nof Applicant\u2019s actions, he therefore gets less credit for good-faith efforts than he \notherwise might. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s past-due tax filings are now resolved. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nThe origin of his tax issues is largely attributable to his marital situation at the time. That \nsituation is now resolved. Applicant and his first wife have now been divorced for \nseveral years, and he has begun a new life with a new family. His tax issues also \noccurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and they no longer cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s admission to the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b and its repeated \nreference on his credit reports, he established through the divorce order that the auto \ndebt is his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(e) therefore applies. Even so, he entered \ninto a reasonable payment plan to resolve the debt and has adhered to it. He also has a \nresponsible plan to address the remainder of the debt through expected proceeds from \nthe imminent sale of the condo. AG \u00b6 20(d) also applies to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI had ample opportunity to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing and to \nform an opinion of his credibility. He was intelligent, well spoken, and respectful, and he \ntreated the process seriously. He presented a well-documented, well-organized case. I \nfound him to be a credible witness. I also credit his service to the country, both in \nuniform and as a government contractor for several years, in a position in which he is \nwell regarded. I believe Applicant has learned his lesson through this experience, and is \nunlikely to find himself in this position again. He has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I considered not only \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, but the record evidence as a whole. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In August 2021, the U.S. Department of Education \nestablished a program of debt forgiveness for students of that school. On September 10, \n2021, he was notified that his student loans had been forgiven. Those accounts do not \nappear on the most recent credit report available. SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f are resolved for Applicant. \n(Response to Form; FORM, Items 3 \u2013 7) \nSOR 1.g \u2013 1.i are three medical debts totaling $416 Applicant incurred during \nperiods of unemployment or under employment. He claims he has repaid those debts, \nbut he has not supported his claims with any corroborating information. Those debts do \nnot appear on the most recent credit report, and they comprise less than one percent of \nthe total debt alleged in the SOR. As the only remaining debts at issue, they do not \npresent a disqualifying trustworthiness concern. SOR 1.g \u2013 1.i are resolved for Applicant. \n(Response to FORM; FORM, Items 4, 5 and 7) \nApplicant disclosed in his e-QIP that has used marijuana with varying frequency \nstarting in 2018. However, during a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government \ninvestigator in June 2020, he disclosed that he first used marijuana as often as daily \nstarting in 2007, when he was in high school. His last documented use of marijuana at \nthe time he applied for a position of trust was in March 2020, after he had been employed \nas a defense contractor for almost two years. A plain reading of the summary of his June \n2020 PSI suggests that he continued to use marijuana after he submitted his e-QIP. In \nOctober 2017, during a search incident to a traffic stop, he was arrested and charged with \npossession of drug paraphernalia, to wit, a small pipe used to smoke marijuana. The \ncharge was later dismissed. (FORM, Items 2, 3, 6 and 7) \nApplicant occasionally uses marijuana in the privacy of his own home so that he \ncan relax. Marijuana also has a positive effect on his (unspecified) medical problems. As \nto whether he will continue to use marijuana, he states that he would stop using the drug \nif he were granted eligibility for a position of trust. In support of his marijuana use, he also \nrefers to the decriminalization of marijuana where he lives and the increasing instances \nof marijuana decriminalization nationwide. (FORM, Items 2, 3 and 7) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013 makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his \nstate of residence, is illegal. Further, illegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces \nand on all military installations by civilian federal employees and by persons employed \nfor work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do grant such access. Each \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination based on examination \nof all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative guidelines. (See Directive, 6.3) \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. \nCommonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. This decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to \nsensitive information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke an applicant\u2019s eligibility. \nAdditionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a position of public \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531) \nA person who has access to sensitive or protected information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nunresolved doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for eligibility in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government\u2019s information supported the SOR allegations that Appellant \naccrued more than $29,000 in delinquent or past-due debt, 99 percent of which was \ncomprised of delinquent student loans. These facts reasonably raised some of the \ntrustworthiness concerns stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant established that his \nstudent loans were discharged in August 2021. Moreover, his three remaining medical \ndebts total less than $500. As such, they present only a de minimus trustworthiness issue. \nThe record as a whole does not present a viable case for disqualification under this \nguideline. Accordingly, the trustworthiness concerns about Applicant\u2019s financial \nconsiderations presented in the SOR are resolved for Applicant. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant has illegally used marijuana since 2007. He also was arrested for \nmisdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia in 2017. This information reasonably \nraises a trustworthiness concern that is stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has used an illegal, controlled substance for over 14 years and was \nfound to be in possession of drug paraphernalia in 2017. He appears to understand that \nthis conduct is inconsistent with occupying a position of trust for work in support of a \nfederal contract. Nonetheless, he has not definitively stated that he has or will discontinue \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nusing marijuana. Instead, Applicant has conditioned his future intent in this regard on \nwhether he receives eligibility for a position of trust. \nI also have considered the following pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant to present \ninformation that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. In response \nto the SOR and the FORM, Applicant did not present information that would support any \nof the aforementioned mitigating conditions. His use of marijuana occurred within the past \ntwo years and while he has been employed by the sponsor for his request to occupy a \nposition of trust. As for future intent, as noted above, he has not definitively started that \nhe will discontinue his illegal drug use. Applicant did not present any information in \nsupport of any of the AG \u00b6 26 mitigating conditions and he has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns established by the Government\u2019s information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines F and H, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are resolved in his favor; however, significant doubts about \nhis suitability for a position of public trust remain because of his use of marijuana. The \nprotection of the national interest is the principal goal of these adjudications. Accordingly, \nthose doubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to sensitive information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nThe Applicant admitted and the record established this disqualifying condition. \nConsideration of mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n5 \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use\nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge\nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20\nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For\nthe recency analysis, the Appeal Board stated:  \n \n \n \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use occurred in April 2020, one month before \nhe submitted his SF-86 in May 2020, and ten months before his SOR was issued in \nFebruary 2021. Applicant asserts that he has turned his life around, that he no longer \nwants to use drugs, and will not use drugs in the future. Among the problems here is the \nrecency of his drug use. Additionally, his written assertions that he is drug-free and has \nno intention of using drugs in the future lack corroboration. While Applicant receives \ncredit for self-reporting his past drug use, that alone is insufficient to mitigate his 12-year \nhistory of self-admitted intermittent use of a variety of drugs. Also problematic, is \nApplicant\u2019s susceptibility to peer pressure to use drugs, which he acknowledged was a \ncommon theme in his past drug use. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nAccordingly, mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 26(a) is not warranted at this time. \nApplicant is able to receive partial credit for acknowledging his drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse under AG \u00b6 26(b) for disassociation with drug-using associates and \ncontacts and changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used under \nsubsections (1) and (2). However, the overall circumstances do not warrant full \nmitigation of security concerns under Guideline H. \nIn summary, apart from partial application of AG \u00b6 26(b), no other mitigating \nconditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is gainfully employed \nand is presumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other \ninformation suggesting his long-standing drug involvement and substance misuse \nproblems are being or have been addressed, doubts remain about his suitability for \naccess to classified information. Protection of the national interest is the principal focus \nof these adjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the drug involvement \nand substance misuse security concerns. By failing to provide such information, and in \nrelying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to fully establish mitigation, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse considerations security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He testified that he possessed a secret \nclearance during some of his time in the service, and that he has held a clearance for \n20 years.

He married in January 2010 and divorced in \nJune 2014. He has been in a domestic partnership relationship since 2011 and has a \nstepson, age 12, and a daughter, age two. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows he worked as a security guard between \nSeptember 2001 and April 2007. He worked at restaurants between April 2007 and \nDecember 2010. He resumed working as a security guard between November 2009 and \nAugust 2013. He worked IT support between August 2013 and May 2016. He started a \nhouse flipping business in 2015. He left his IT job to concentrate on his house flipping \nbusiness and was self-employed between May 2016 and May 2017. He worked as a \nsecurity guard between May 2017 and December 2019. Applicant became a licensed \nrealtor in 2018, seeking a second job to increase his earnings. (Tr. 28) He has been \nworking as a cyber-analyst for his current employer and security sponsor, a federal \ncontractor, since June 2020. (Tr. 28) \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was working in 2012. She stopped working when she moved in \nwith him in 2014. This resulted in a loss of $75,000 income to the household when he \nbecame the sole provider. She started working again in 2020, and she is making about \n$93,000 a year. Applicant testified she has been helping him address his financial \nobligations. (Tr. 30, 40) \nIn response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2019 SCA, \nApplicant disclosed that he had financial problems and revealed four of the accounts \nalleged in the SOR in which he had established payment agreements. He was \ninterviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in June 2020, \nand discussed most of the accounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant explained that his financial problems resulted from a combination of \nfactors. His fianc\u00e9 has been suffering from chronic Lyme disease since 2011. The \ndoctors did not realize she was suffering from it until 2016 or 2017, when it really started \nto affect her being able to live. She could not work and was in constant pain. She \nrequired special medical treatments and medicines. He stated that most chronic Lyme \ndisease treatment is not covered by insurance. He had to make the majority of the \nmedical payments out of his savings. (Tab F-1; Tr. 18-19) \nApplicant has been working two jobs since about 2012. He was a full-time \nsecurity \nguard \nduring \nthe \nweek \nand \nworked \na \nhouse \nflipping \nbusiness \n(construction/repairing investment properties) during the weekends. (Tr. 19) In 2016, he \npurchased three out of state properties, two in state (1) one in state (2). He had trouble \nwith construction crews completing the jobs on time, and one of the properties burned \ndown. The insurance did not cover the full amount of the loss and he used personal \nfunds to pay the creditor for the property. He sold the properties between 2017 and \n2018. He is no longer in the house flipping business. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems exacerbated in 2018. He sought financial \ncounseling and assistance from an insurance company and a debt resolution company. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe insurance company helped him understand credit worthiness and how to work with \ncredit companies to mitigate his debt. He contacted his creditors, established payment \nagreements, and started to settle and pay his delinquent debts. He is now concentrating \non saving money for his fianc\u00e9\u2019s medical expenses and repairing his credit. Applicant \nstarted making payments on his delinquent debts after his fianc\u00e9 started working in \n2020. Prior to that, he was the sole source of income and his income was insufficient to \npay the delinquent accounts and their living expenses. (Tr. 73-75) \nThe status of the SOR allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a alleged a charged-off account for $16,193; 1.b a charged-off account \nfor $14,220; and 1.c a charged-off account for $12,569, all of which were resolved via \ncancellations of debt (IRS Form 1099-C). (See, Tabs F-4a, E, and F-4c; Tr. 52-53) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a collection account for $11,594. Applicant and the creditor \nestablished a settlement agreement in January 2019, and he is making payments as \nagreed. (See, Tabs F-4d; Tr. 53) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a charged-off account for $8,910. Applicant settled the \naccount and paid it off in April 2021. (See, Tab F-4e) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged a charged-off account for $8,300. Applicant settled the account \nfor less than owed in April 2021 and paid it off in May 2021. (See, Tab F-4f) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged a collection account for $7,851. Applicant settled the account \nfor less than owed in April 2021, and paid it off. (See, Tab F-4g; Tr. 57) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j alleged collection accounts for $7,846, $7,801, and \n$7,796, respectively. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows he established payment plans in \nJanuary 2019 for the three accounts and made 27 consecutive payments of $50 \nmonthly, until March 2021 for each account. He submitted evidence of three additional \n$50 payments made on each of the three accounts during January through March 2022. \nHe testified he is still making his payments as scheduled. (See, Tabs E, F-4h, F-4i, and \nF-4j; Tr. 59-63) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleged a charged-off account for $7,783. Applicant settled the \naccount for less than owed in June 2020 and paid it off in April 2021. (See, Tab F-4k) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m alleged the same account in collection for $950. Applicant \nsettled the account in February 2021 and paid it off in April 2021. (See, Tab F-4n; Tr. \n66) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleged an account in collection for $733.

Applicant settled it for less \nthan owed and paid it off. (See, Tab F-4o; Tr. 67) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p through 1.t alleged that Applicant failed to timely file Federal income \ntax returns for tax years (TY) 2016 through 2020. He claimed that he timely filed his TY \n2016 income tax return. At hearing, Applicant presented a Form 1040X (amended filing) \nfor TY 2016, filed in 2019. During his testimony, Applicant explained his 2016 tax \npreparer made some mistakes with his 2016 income tax return and the IRS returned it \nto be corrected. He asked the IRS what was wrong with his initial 2016 tax return, and it \ntook the IRS until 2019 to answer his questions. \nIn 2019, Applicant retained the services of a professional tax preparer to help him \nfile an amended 2016 tax return. (Tr. 13-14; Tr2. 12) He was not happy with the tax \nprofessional work and, in 2021, he retained another tax professional who is currently \nhelping him resolve his tax problems. (Tr. 51) \nApplicant filed his Federal income tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019 in \nMay 20, 2020. (Tr2. 7; Tab F-4q) He timely filed his TY 2020 income tax return. (Tr2. 7-\n8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u through 1.y alleged that Applicant is indebted to the Federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes for TYs 2016 through 2020. Applicant anticipated a \n$13,000 refund for TY 2016, and he received only $3,000. He believes that when the \nIRS finalizes its review of his 2016 income tax return, he will receive a refund of over \n$10,000. To claim the refund, a return for TY 2016 must have been filed by July 15, \n2020. (www.IRS.gov - three years after due date) \nApplicant admitted he is indebted to the Federal government for delinquent taxes \nfor TYs 2017 through 2020. (Tr2. 7-8) However, his documentary evidence shows that \nhe anticipated a $9,793 refund for TY 2017. He testified that he did not receive the \nrefund because the IRS applied it to prior years\u2019 tax debt. (Tab F-4q; Tr2. 19-20) \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 income tax return shows that he owes the IRS $1,404. (Tab F-\n4r) His 2020 income tax return shows that he owes the IRS $8,104. (Tab F-4t) He did \nnot pay either his 2018 or his 2020 tax debt. He claimed his tax preparer advised him \nnot to pay them because the IRS allegedly owes him over $10,000 for TY 2016. \nApplicant anticipates that when his 2016 taxes are resolved in his favor, anything he \nowes for other tax years will be offset by what the IRS owes him. Applicant claimed he \nhas set aside $30,000 in a savings account to pay any possible taxes he may owe the \nIRS. (Tr. 42; Tr2. 20-28) Applicant could not recall whether he owed taxes or received a \nrefund for TY 2019. \nApplicant testified he owed another state (D) $24,000 for delinquent real estate \nproperty taxes not alleged in the SOR. He paid $8,000 in 2020, $8,000 in 2021, and \nagreed to pay $8,000 in 2022 to settle the debt and avoid losing the property.

He noted it was difficult to do so when he was the sole provider for the family. \nNow that his fianc\u00e9 is working again, he is confident that if he is allowed to keep his \nclearance he will be able to resolve all of his financial problems. He highlighted that he \nserved in the Marines and has held a clearance for over 21 years with no issues or \nsecurity concerns, except for those alleged in the SOR. He believes that his time in the \nservice and his current efforts to resolve his financial problems demonstrate that he is \nnot a security risk. \nApplicant stated that his financial situation is getting better, and that he is in \ndecent financial shape. He is able and willing to pay his delinquent debts and promised \nto be financially responsible in the future. To ensure his financial problems do not occur \nagain, he intends to continue his financial counseling and using the services of a tax \nprofessional. \nApplicant\u2019s net cash flow per month is $5,800. His expenses per month including \nshort and long-term debt payments are around $3,300. He noted that he had a lot of \nthings that were out of my control a couple of years ago and those amounts really took \na toll on his finances. He believes his debts are currently small because he put myself in \npayment plans and worked with credit financial institutions that help him get back in the \nblack. He stated that the chance of accruing delinquent debt because of his cohabitant\u2019s \nmedical problems and being unable to work outside their home are unlikely to recur. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information.

All available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be \nconsidered. [First time SEAD used] \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He accumulated 15 \ndelinquent debts that were either charged off or placed for collection. He also failed to \ntimely file Federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2019, and is indebted to the \nIRS for TY 2018 and 2010. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant resolved the 15 delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. Of those, 11 \nwere resolved before the SOR was issued (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.h through 1.m, and \n1.o); and four were resolved after he was issued the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g, and 1.n). \nThe evidence suggests Applicant timely filed income tax returns for TYs 2016 and 2020. \nHe filed late income tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Tabs 4-Fs and F-4t) \nApplicant is not indebted to the Federal government for delinquent taxes for TYs \n2016 and 2017. The evidence does not establish that he owes delinquent taxes for TY \n2019. He owes delinquent taxes for TYs 2018 and 2020. As previously noted, he did not \npay his delinquent taxes on the advice of his tax professional. He has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the amount of taxes he owes, and he has taken actions to resolve the \nissue. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable. \nApplicant credibly testified that he anticipates a refund for over $10,000 for TY \n2016. His professional tax preparer advised him not to pay the taxes owed for TYs 2018 \nand 2020, because the debt would be off set against the anticipated TY 2016 refund. \nApplicant set aside a significant amount of money to pay the IRS and set up a payment \nplan in the event that the IRS rules against him on the TY 2016 tax return revision. \nApplicant was honorably discharged from the Marines after serving four years on \nactive duty. He attributed his financial problems to his fianc\u00e9\u2019s medical problems and \ntreatment expenses, her inability to work for a number of years, her inability to \ncontribute financially to the household, and his failed business flipping houses, which \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas adversely aggravated by a fire that burned one of the houses. All of these factors \ncould be considered as circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected or \naggravated his financial situation. \nAs the DOHA Appeal Board has noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not \ndirected at collecting debts. Neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability. On balance, when considered in light of the record as a whole, I find that the \nevidence is sufficient to establish that Applicant was financially responsible under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant was proactive and diligent resolving his delinquent accounts. He \nstarted addressing his delinquent accounts well in advance to the issuance of the SOR. \nHe sought out financial counseling, communicated with his creditors and established \npayment plans, and has been complying with the agreed payments. He paid off eight of \nfinancial accounts alleged in the SOR, and is making payments on three accounts. In \ndoing so, Applicant has demonstrated some financial responsibility. \nApplicant was irresponsible when he filed late his income tax returns. He has \nbeen working and filing income tax returns for many years. Because of his time in the \nservice and holding a clearance, he knew or should have known that his failure to timely \nfile his income tax returns and pay his taxes would create a security concern. \nNotwithstanding, I note that Applicant retained a tax professional and started \nworking on fixing his tax problems before the SOR was issued. The TY 2016 amended \ntax return was prepared by a tax professional in 2019. He retained a second tax \nprofessional when he believed the first one was not doing the work. He filed his TYs \n2017, 2018, and 2019 income tax returns in May 20, 2020. (Tab F-4q) His TY 2019 was \nonly six weeks late, and his TY 2020 income tax return was filed on time. He also was \ncandid disclosing and discussing his tax problems during his hearings. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant does not has a problem complying \nwith government rules, regulations, and systems. His evidence is sufficient to establish \nmitigation of the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and he made a good-faith effort to file his income tax returns. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are being resolved and they do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nconcept.

Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate \ndetermination\u201d of whether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 42, receives favorable credit for his honorable service in the U.S. \nmilitary and his work for a federal contractor. He has held a secret clearance during the \nlast 20 years without any issues or concerns, except for those in the SOR. He receives \nfavorable credit for resolving the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. He should \nhave been more diligent filing his income tax returns. However, he made good-faith \nefforts to correct his mistakes. He has a reasonable basis to dispute the amount of \ntaxes he owes, and he has taken actions to resolve the issue. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.y: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b. \nThe Government\u2019s exhibits and testimony support the SOR allegations, except as \nspecifically addressed below. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal history began in 1996 when he was arrested for domestic \nviolence against his girlfriend at the time, who later became his spouse. He and his current \nspouse were living together from 1996 to 2001, then again in 2010. Applicant testified \nabout an argument between him and his girlfriend after a football game where she was \nthe aggressor, he called the police, and she left the home. However, he claims they \narrested him because they spoke to him, he was the male, and he was considered the \n\u201cperpetrator.\u201d He was convicted of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse/cohabitant and \nsentenced to 10 days\u2019 confinement and three years\u2019 probation. \nIn 1998 he was arrested for misdemeanor minor in possession of liquor, \nintimidating/stalking, and minor driving after drinking. He was found guilty of minor in \npossession and driving after drinking, and sentenced in May 2000 to five days\u2019 \nconfinement and probation. The record is unclear whether SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are \nduplicates of the same offenses as asserted by the Applicant, and insufficient evidence \nwas introduced to made a determination, therefore SOR \u00b6 1.c is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nIn September 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI and DUI with a BAC of .10 or \nmore. He was found guilty in January 2001 and sentenced to 10 days\u2019 confinement, \nsuspended. Then, in October 2001, he was arrested for felony aggravated assault with a \ndeadly weapon, felony burglary in the 1st  degree, and felony aggravated assault \u2013 \nentering a residence. He pleaded guilty to felony aggravated assault in December 2001, \nand was sentenced to three months\u2019 confinement and three years\u2019 probation. Applicant \nclaims he entered his girlfriend\u2019s residence while they were fighting and he was arrested. \nHe asserted that he and his spouse, who was his girlfriend at the time, argued and fought \noften after consuming alcohol. He testified that he was permitted into his cousin\u2019s home \nand confronted his girlfriend there, and pushed her. In his personal subject interview (PSI) \n(GE 2), he claimed that he violated probation from his 2000 DUI conviction for not \ncompleting court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) classes and not checking in with \nhis probation officer as directed. He also violated probation for having a new offense in \n2001. \nIn August 2002, Applicant violated probation and a bench warrant was issued for \nhis arrest. In December 2002, he was arrested in another state as a fugitive from justice \nbased on his bench warrant. His probation was revoked in February 2003, and he was \nsentenced to serve three years\u2019 confinement.

(Tr. 49.) He \nsaid the burglary, assault to enter a residence, and assault charges were reduced to one \ndomestic violence charge. \nIn 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with inflicting corporal injury on a \nspouse/cohabitant. He was with another girlfriend at the time, who he claimed would call \nthe police after every incident because she knew he was vulnerable to criminal charges. \nThey drank, argued, and fought. He claimed she drank more than him and was \u201cacting \nout,\u201d so he told her to leave and she called the police. She failed to appear in court as the \ncomplaining witness, so the case was dismissed. \nIn 2010, he was again arrested for inflicting corporal injury on spouse/cohabitant \nand vandalism of $400 or more. He claims the charges resulted from another fight with \nhis girlfriend, who failed to appear in court as a complaining witness, and were dismissed. \nIn 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI and DUI with a BAC of .08 or more after \nreturning from a \u201cdate night\u201d outing with his spouse. In 2020, he pleaded guilty to DUI with \na BAC of .08 or more, and was sentenced to 180 days\u2019 confinement and three years\u2019 \nprobation. He testified that his BAC was .14, despite his answer to the SOR where he \nclaimed he had \u201ca drink with dinner\u201d that evening. He served community service and his \nsentence to confinement was suspended. He remains on probation until January 28, \n2023. \nNo alcohol consumption is permitted while he is on probation. As a result, Applicant \nstated since returning from prison, he only drank on \u201cspecial occasions,\u201d but he stopped \ndrinking after March 9, 2019, and denies having an alcohol disorder. (Ans.) \nIn 2017, Applicant completed his SCA but failed to disclose his charges and \nconvictions involving domestic violence or alcohol or drugs as required in SCA Section \n22 \u2013 Police Record. He testified that he read the questions as only asking about offenses \nin the last seven years, not \u201cever\u201d as indicated in questions regarding domestic violence \nand alcohol offenses. The offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d required \ndisclosure on the SCA, but Applicant did not list them. In his post-hearing submission, he \nhighlighted some areas on his SCA where he disclosed some items, but with reference \nto the section asking about domestic violence or alcohol related charges, he changed his \n\u201cno\u201d answer to \u201cyes,\u201d and wrote \u201cmistake \u2013 sorry.\u201d (AE A (SCA pages)) \nIn addition, Applicant was terminated from employment in May 2016 for violation \nof the company code of conduct and harassment policy. (GE 9) The company reported \nthat on May 11, 2016, Applicant was aggressive to and threatened another employee, \nand referred to supervisors with inappropriate racial slurs. He was terminated on May 16, \n2016. Applicant did not disclose this termination on his 2017 SCA as required under \nSection 13A - Employment Activities.

The document, in and of \nitself, is not dipositive as to whether he was laid off, fired, or both. He admitted in \ntestimony, that he had a verbal altercation with his supervisor after he was laid off, but \ndenied any verbal altercations or use of racial slurs about his supervisors, but he agreed \nthat he may have been fired after being laid off. In his PSI, Applicant disclosed that he \nhad a verbal altercation with his manager after being laid off, and told him to \u201cF---- off.\u201d \nAs a result, the manager tried to deny him unemployment benefits, but he appealed the \nmatter in \u201cunemployment court\u201d and was awarded benefits. (GE 2) \nThe DCSA CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation, which occurred \nin September 2020. (GE 3) Despite claiming in testimony and in his answer to the SOR \nthat he stopped drinking in 2019, the psychologist reported that he stated he was \n\u201ccurrently\u201d consuming alcohol once every three weeks or on holidays and special \noccasions, and consumes an average of four beers on those occasions. He denied ever \nconsuming alcohol in greater frequency than that, or that alcohol had ever impaired his \nsocial, interpersonal, or occupational functioning. The doctor noted that documentation \nhe reviewed showed Applicant reported consuming larger amounts in the past, including \nconsuming 12-18 beers over a three-day period, and the impacts alcohol had on his \nconflicts with his spouse. Applicant admitted in his 2018 PSI that from age 16 to 25, he \nconsumed 10 beers each day on weekends, and from age 25 to present, he consumed \n18 beers on weekends over the entire weekend (Friday to Sunday). \nOf note, the psychologist stated that Applicant admitted to a verbal altercation with \nhis supervisor, and that he was given a choice to work part-time or take unemployment \ncompensation. He chose unemployment compensation, but \u201creceived a letter several \nmonths later from unemployment services stating that he should not have received \nbenefits due to him being \u2018fired.\u2019\u201d Applicant told the doctor that he disputed the company\u2019s \nallegation and was able to maintain his unemployment benefits. He admitted that he \nengaged in an altercation with a supervisor and cursed at him, but vehemently denied \nusing any racial language. (GE 3, p.2) \nApplicant reported participating in several anger management classes but did not \ncomplete the courses. He and his girlfriend also participated in about five to six counseling \nsessions. Applicant also noted he did not like the constant oversight and invasion of \nprivacy that came with being on probation, which led to him avoiding his probation officer \nand eventual probation violation. \nThe psychologist determined that Applicant is not currently experiencing any \nsignificant psychological symptoms that would disqualify him from being able to hold a \nsecurity clearance, however, his history of sustained alcohol use across his lifespan is \nindicative of an alcohol use disorder. Applicant\u2019s examination showed that he answered \nquestions with a \u201chigh degree of defensiveness\u201d and he attempted to portray himself as \nbeing free of faults and managed the impressions and denials he gave to minimize \u201ceven \nthe most common shortfalls\u201d to a degree well outside the expected range. It was noted \nthat Applicant struggles in areas including compulsiveness, alcohol abuse, \nsuspiciousness, and inflated self-esteem.

Cumulatively, the findings show Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cjudgment and reliability are compromised by his past, and likely current, alcohol use. Due \nto the variety of omissions and lack of candor in his reporting, the [Applicant\u2019s] \ntrustworthiness cannot be considered intact and should also be viewed with a high level \nof caution.\u201d In testimony, Applicant disputed the doctor\u2019s findings and conclusions and \nbelieved the doctor was trying to catch him in a lie. He stated that he did not feel he was \nan alcoholic because \u201can alcoholic is somebody who drinks beer every day constantly, \u2026 \nto cope with life, to deal with their problems, and all that stuff.\u201d (Tr. 77)  \nGovernment exhibit (GE 11) is a company report to the DoD alleging that Applicant \nprovoked a dispute with a coworker in August 2020. Apparently, Applicant commented \non the employee\u2019s IQ and called him \u201cretarded,\u201d then challenged him to \u201cdo something\nabout it\u201d in a face-to-face confrontation. Applicant was reprimanded for violating company\npolicy. This incident was not alleged in the SOR. I will consider this unalleged incident in\nassessing Applicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or\nchanged circumstances; in considering whether he has demonstrated successful\nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to his Answer to the SOR, Applicant included work awards and \ncertificates, and character letters from his wife, daughter, and daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9. As I \nmentioned in the hearing, these statements appeared strangely similar and do not attest \nto him ceasing use of alcohol in 2019. (Tr. 78-79) In a post-hearing submission, Applicant \nsubmitted several letters of support from his current coworkers, supervisor and manager \nattesting to his work ethic, honesty, decency, and superb work performance. He testified \nabout his love for his work and country, and current healthy lifestyle with his spouse and \nchildren. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has a long history of criminal conduct that began as a teenager and \ncontinued to 2019. He has also shown a tendency to deny, minimize, or ignore his \ninvolvement or culpability in his criminal offenses. He has knowingly violated probation in \nthe past, and is currently on probation until January 2023. Applicant has not provided \nsufficient or convincing evidence in mitigation. Given the totality of his involvement with \nlaw enforcement over a number of years, past felony conviction, and incidents of \naggressive actions toward coworkers, I continue to have concerns that this pattern of \nmisconduct may continue given the right circumstances. Although he has proffered \nfavorable employment and personal character letters, there has been insufficient time \nelapsed to show that he has left criminal activity behind, and truly changed his lifestyle. \nAt 43 years of age, he should have his life and conduct under control, but the evidence \nof such a change is sparse given his 2019 arrest and 2020 altercation at work. Given the \ntotality and longevity of his conduct, I remain doubtful about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment at this time. SOR \u00b6 1.c is a duplicate, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h were \ndismissed and are found in Applicant\u2019s favor.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related driving incidents along with the diagnosis by a \npsychologist of alcohol abuse disorder, are sufficient to establish the disqualifying \nconditions above. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23, including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nLike his criminal record, Applicant has a long history of alcohol-related incidents, \nthe last being a DUI in 2019. He is now on probation, and prohibited from consuming \nalcohol, and unsurprisingly, he stated he quit alcohol after this conviction. His motivations \nare suspect, as he has had many opportunities to limit his alcohol use before they arose \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto an altercation or drunk driving incident, but did not. He also rejects the diagnosis from \nthe psychiatrist, insisting that he does not have an alcohol problem. Finally, he was \nreferred to alcohol counseling more than once, but he did not conclude the courses. \nApplicant appears to be in denial, much like his testimony and assertions to the \npsychologist. I am not persuaded by sufficient evidence that his newfound abstinence is \nmore than a court-ordered requirement, or is going to last. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s assertions, significant doubts remain about his judgment \nbased on his alcohol-related offenses to include DUI. Likewise, his rejection of a medical \nopinion is indicative of his unwillingness to confront his alcohol issues. The evidence is \ninsufficient to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. No mitigating condition \nfully applies. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b616 are: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe evidence is sufficient to establish the disqualifying condition above. \nConditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts, and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant falsified his 2017 SCA by omitting his termination from employment in \n2016, despite knowing that the company fired him. He may have reason to believe that \nthe company acted improperly in firing him after he was laid off, but he received notice of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing terminated for misconduct. The security clearance application is the place to list \nsuch notices, not the place to contest their accuracy or timing. In addition, Applicant \nknowingly falsified his SCA by omitting his involvement in criminal activity involving \nalcohol and domestic violence. He claims that he did not read the question carefully, but \nwith his criminal history, I find it unpersuasive that he did not read the questions carefully \nand did not know that his earlier criminal involvement with alcohol and domestic abuse \nmay be relevant and reportable. I am unpersuaded that he mistakenly thought the \nquestions related to the previous seven years given his practice of minimizing his conduct. \nBased on the totality of the SOR allegations, inconsistent testimony, recurring \ninappropriate or illegal conduct, and falsifications on his SCA, Applicant\u2019s judgment \ncontinues to be questionable. He has not submitted sufficient evidence to alleviate those \nconcerns. The allegations are not minor, nor did they occur in unique circumstances \nwhere they are not likely to recur. He has not accepted full responsibility for his conduct, \nand appears to downplay the gravity of his conduct or the extent of his involvement. I am \nnot clear why the array of incidents have occurred in Applicant\u2019s life, but alcohol, and \nanger management seems to be centrally implicated. He is a mature, intelligent adult who \nhas won praises for his work ethic and performance in his current job, but his history and \ncontinued conduct, including his completion of his SCA, raise doubts about judgment and \ndecision-making, such that he cannot be trusted with classified information. I find no \nmitigating condition is fully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines J, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s awards, current family situation, and his support from family and coworkers. \nHowever, I am not convinced that Applicant is willing or able to permanently put his past \nmisconduct aside and show good judgment in all areas of his life, especially those that \nare relevant to security eligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1b; 1.d-1.f; 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.g, 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 3.a-3.b:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.

    "full_text": "__________ \n__________ \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n----------------------------------\n) \nISCR Case No. 20-03749 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Nicole Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n1/28/2021 \nDecision \nWESLEY, ROGER C. Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guidelines the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 10, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on October 6, 2021 A hearing was scheduled for \nNovember 5, 2021, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) Applicant relied on six exhibits \n(AEs A-F) and one witness (herself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 12, \n2021. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with payment updates on her \nfederal and state taxes, further documentation of her dispute with SOR creditor 1.g, and \nany settlements and payment updates with her remaining creditors. For good cause \nshown, Applicant was granted seven calendar days to supplement the record. \nDepartment Counsel was afforded two days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documentation \ncovering her state tax payment plan, a bank statement reflecting creditor payments, \ncorrespondence addressing Applicant\u2019s dispute with the debt covered by SOR creditor \n1.g, a release of lien and cancellation of debt by SOR creditor 1.k, an email crediting \npayments made to SOR creditor 1.f, and a payment made to the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) on her federal taxes owed for tax year 2015. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmissions were admitted for consideration as AEs G-N without objection. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated (a) delinquent taxes owed \nthe IRS for tax years 2013-2015 in the aggregate amount of $22,954; (b) delinquent \nstate taxes owed to her state of residence in the amount of $15,416; and (c) nine \ndelinquent consumer debts exceeding $320,000. Allegedly, these debts remain \nunresolved and outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged delinquent \ndebts with explanations. \nShe claimed generally that she did not have any of the \nunderlying conditions characterized as potential problems under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. \nSpecifically, Applicant claimed her 2013 and 2014 federal tax debts have been \ndischarged. She claimed that her delinquent 2015 federal taxes are being paid through \nher tax refunds on a yearly basis. She also claimed her owed state taxes are being paid \nthrough a payment plan with the state at the monthly rate of $236 that has produced a \nreduction in the overall balance. She further claimed that her mortgage debt with SOR \ncreditor 1.d has been discharged through a 2015 foreclosure of a home that she \npurchased for $730,000 in November 2006 and was worth only $429,000 by 2015. \nIn further explanation, Applicant claimed that the judgment covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f \nis being satisfied with $400 monthly payments with no estimation of a satisfaction date. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nShe claimed her $214,175 credit card debt with SOR creditor 1.g continues to be \ndisputed as a fraudulent debt that she will not pay. She claimed her SOR \u00b6 1.h \ndelinquent debt should have been resolved in her SOR \u00b6 1.e foreclosure \nAddressing the alleged medical debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j, Applicant \nclaimed the two medical debts represent unplanned visits to an emergency room, where \nher daughter was delivered stillborn, and they are debts she does not intend to pay. She \nclaimed uncertainty over the $361 charged-off debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.k that no \nlonger appears on her credit report. Responding to SOR allegations covered by \u00b6 1.l, \nshe claimed this account is in forbearance by virtue of the COVID relief bill, and \npreviously was in current status. And, Applicant claimed that the debt covered by SOR \u00b6 \n1.m is no longer delinquent and has been paid on time for the last year. \nApplicant attached several exhibits to her response. She included a photograph \nof her current home, estimated to be worth $519,000. Other attachments consisted of \nan updated IRS tax billing for tax year 2015 in the amount of $6,002 (noting a $3,527 \ncredit resulting from an applied tax overpayment of Applicant\u2019s owed 2019 tax balance) \nand a payment plan cancellation notice from the comptroller of her ate of residence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Applicant denied generally each of the allegations in the SOR with \nexplanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact \nfollow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never been married but has cohabited with a significant other since \nDecember 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 51-52) She had one child from this relationship who was \ndelivered stillborn in November 2015. (GE 1) She earned a high school diploma in May \n1984. (GE 1) She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in in May 1992 and a master\u2019s degree in \nbusiness and health care in May 1996. (GE 1; Tr. 50) Applicant did not report any \nmilitary service. \nSince September 2018, Applicant has been employed by her current employer \nas an enterprise architect. (GE 1; Tr. 50) Pending the outcome of her security clearance \napplication, she has been placed on administrative leave. (Tr. 50) Between August 2017 \nand May 2018, she worked for another employer as a project manager, before \nterminating her employment over pregnancy issues. (GE 1) \nApplicant was employed by other employers in various types of positions \nbetween September 2015 and August 2017. She reported periods of unemployment \nbetween June 2015 and September 2018. (GE 1) Applicant owned and operated her \nown private business between September 2004 and June 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 54) She \nheld either a security clearance or public trust position between October 2005 and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 2017, and was reportedly denied a security clearance in August 2018 due to \nfinancial issues. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2013 and 2015, Applicant accumulated delinquent federal taxes owed \nthe IRS for these tax years. (GEs 1-3) For tax year 2013, she accrued $9,000 in \ndelinquent federal taxes (inclusive of interest and penalties for late-filing and non-\npayment). (Applicant\u2019s response and AE D) IRS tax transcripts for tax year 2013 \ndocument IRS application of levied tax credits from other tax years in March 2017 to \nreduce Applicant\u2019s balance to zero. (AE D; Tr. 56-57) The IRS tax transcript for tax year \n2013 documented an installment agreement Applicant arranged with the IRS in April \n2016 that was cancelled in July 2017 for apparent lack of payment compliance. (AE D) \nFor tax year 2014, Applicant reported federal taxes owed of $3,400. (AE D) \nAdded penalties of $5,341 to cover late filing and payments raised Applicant\u2019s 2014 \nfederal tax assessment to over $21,000. (AE D) Without an installment agreement in \nplace, the IRS supplemented Applicant\u2019s one-time October 2017 voluntary payment of \n$1,836 with a series of involuntary levies to create a zero balance in May 2019. (AE D; \nTr. 56-57) \nIRS transcript records reflect delinquent federal income taxes owed by Applicant \nfor tax year 2015 exceeding $9,000. (AE D) Applicant\u2019s net taxes for tax year 2015 were \ncalculated by the IRS in September 2021 to be $6,130, after making allowances for her \nwithholding from her reported income ($6,681), added penalties ($2,223), accrued \ninterest ($2,598), net voluntary payments from Applicant in 2020 ($1,000), and \ninvoluntary levies from the IRS on scheduled Applicant refunds for other years ($5,979). \n(AE D; Tr. 57-59) \nWith Applicant\u2019s credited voluntary $1,000 payment to the IRS in November \n2021, Applicant currently has a reported past-due balance of around $5,130 for tax year \n2015, with interest continuing to accrue at the legal rate. (AEs D and I-J) While \nApplicant had an installment agreement in place for a brief period spanning June 2019 \nand May 2020, the agreement was cancelled by the IRS in May 2020 for non-\ncompliance with the payment terms of the agreement. (AE D; Tr. 48) IRS records do not \ndocument any other installment agreements with Applicant. Since 2015, Applicant has \nstayed current with her federal taxes (i.e., for tax years 2016-2020), and pledged to \ncontinue to do so in the future with the aid of IRS levies on any scheduled refunds she \nis eligible to receive. (AE L; Tr. 60,106) \nState tax records reflect past delinquent taxes owed by Applicant to her state of \nresidence for tax year 2015 in the amount of $12,703. (GE 1 and AE E) From a starting \nbalance of $15,416 in 2016, Applicant made several payments between 2016 and 2020 \nthrough credited involuntary levies. (AE E; Tr. 62) In 2020, Applicant entered into an \ninstallment agreement with the state\u2019s comptroller. (AE E) Under this installment \nagreement, she made a number of voluntary payments that reduced the overall tax \namount owed to $12,073. (AE E) When she defaulted in her payment terms, her state\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomptroller canceled her installment agreement in April 2020. (AE E; Tr. 62-63) \nApplicant entered into a new installment agreement with her state\u2019s comptroller\u2019s office \nin August 2021. (AE E; Tr. 61-62) \nUnder the terms of this new installment agreement, Applicant is obligated to \nmake monthly payments of $235, beginning in September 2021. (AE E; Tr. 69-71) While \nher most recent bank statement reflects an October 2021 $235 payment, it does not \ncredit her with a September 2021 payment or any other obligated payments, and it \nremains unclear from the provided documentation whether Applicant made either a \nSeptember payment or any other payments called for in the agreement. (AE K; 61-62) \nBesides her tax debt accruals, Applicant accumulated major delinquent \nconsumer debts over a 17-year period spanning 2004-2021. Credit reports document \nthat she opened two mortgage accounts in 2005. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 73-74) One was a first \nmortgage for $583,000, (covered by SOR \u00b6 1.e) in November 2005, to finance a \n$730,000 home purchase, and another was a second mortgage of $86,000 with the \nsame lender (covered by SOR \u00b6 1.h) in December 2005 to finance a reported home \nequity loan. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 78-79) Credit reports document that Applicant\u2019s first mortgage \nholder sold its interest in the mortgage to SOR creditor 1.e in December 2014 on terms \nnot disclosed. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 74, 116) \nFor the first 10 years of her mortgages, Applicant was able to manage her \nmortgages safely without any cost-over-runs. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 76) By 2015, the assessed \nvalue of Applicant\u2019s home had fallen precipitously to $429,000. (Applicant\u2019s response; \nTr. 27) Facing balloon payments and a devalued home, she ceased making payments \nand prepared herself for foreclosure of the first and second mortgages on her property. \n(Tr. 27-28, 76-78) Following Applicant\u2019s default in her mortgage payments in June 2015, \nSOR creditor 1.e foreclosed (June 2015) its mortgage. (GEs 2-4) Whether the lender\u2019s \nforeclosure produced enough sale proceeds to cover its first mortgage is unclear. Credit \nreports do not assign any deficiency balance, and Applicant expressed no awareness of \nany remaining deficiency resulting from the foreclosure. (GEs 2-4) \nBy far, the largest delinquent debt accumulated by Applicant between 2005 and \n2020 is covered by SOR \u00b6 1.g. (GEs 2-4 and AEs F and H; Tr. 28-29) This reported \ncharged-off account is documented in Applicant\u2019s credit reports as a $214,175 \nconsumer account with a major credit card firm that is covered by SOR \u00b6 1.g. Through \nthis credit card firm, Applicant financed advertising credits with a major internet firm in \nexcess of $224,000 during 2014. (GEs 2-4 and AEs F and H; Tr. 39-46, 91, 102) After \nadvancing over $60,000 to SOR creditor 1.g to cover initial advertising charges with the \ncreditor\u2019s internet merchant, she found a number of claimed discrepancies in the \nnumber of clicks the merchant charged her. (AE H; Tr. 85-86, 91, 102) \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, SOR creditor 1.g opened a billing dispute over these \ncharges in June 2014. (AE F; Tr. 38-48, 78-80) After a thorough review of the \ndocumentation furnished by its internet customer, SOR creditor 1.g validated the \ncharges for its merchant\u2019s services to Applicant and referred Applicant to the internet \nmerchant for further information and discussions. (AE F) Following up with the internet \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmerchant, Applicant sought clarifications of the internet\u2019s costing data for Applicant\u2019s \nregistered clicks to its site in 2014. (AE H) In email exchanges with the merchant, \nApplicant claimed only 839 visits to the merchant\u2019s internet site and questioned the \n71,000 visits credited to her by the merchant. (AE H) \nEnsuing investigations by both the credit card issuer and the charging internet \nmerchant with Applicant-supplied data produced favorable results for the financing \ncredit card firm who confirmed the validity of the billings. (AEs F and H; Tr. 90-91) \nCommunications between Applicant and the internet merchant whose services she \nused for her business advertising never facilitated any kind of resolution of the charges \nbilled to SOR creditor 1.g. Unable to convince her creditors of the validity of her claims, \nApplicant ceased all communications with both the creditor and its internet merchant \nafter June 2014. (GEs 2-4 and AEs F and H; Tr. 38-46) Applicant\u2019s dispute with SOR \ncreditor 1.g has never been resolved. (Tr. 92) Credit reports confirm that in 2016 the \ndebt was charged off to profit and loss. (GEs 2-4) And, the debt has since been \nremoved from Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit report. (GEs 2-4 and AE C; Tr. 34-35, 136-137)   \nWhether Applicant\u2019s dispute with SOR creditor 1.g. can be attributed to good-\nfaith misunderstandings over the merchant\u2019s billing practices (i.e., charging for the \nnumber of clicks to the website rather than for the number of visits) is unclear based on \nthe documentation and hearing testimony supplied by Applicant. To date, she has not \nprovided any contemporaneous documentation of the claims materials she furnished \nSOR creditor 1.g, or any other substantiating documentation to aid in assessing the \nmerits of her dispute. \nPertinent documentation from Applicant covering her dispute with SOR creditor \n1.g could be expected to yield information covering the substance of her disputes with \nher creditors, any settlement discussions between the parties, and whether Applicant \never offered to pay SOR creditor 1.g for the charges she acknowledged to be legitimate. \nWithout more evidence from Applicant on the substantive grounds of her dispute with \nSOR creditor 1.g, and any prior initiatives taken by Applicant with the creditor and its \ninternet customer to resolve her dispute amicably, either bilaterally or through mutually \nenlisted arbitration and mediation services available in her community, before \nsuspending any further payments to the creditor, the debt dispute issues raised by \nApplicant cannot be favorably resolved. \nOther large delinquent debts are covered in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l. SOR \u00b6 1.h \ninvolves a mortgage debt of $86,617 arising out of a home equity loan Applicant \narranged on her former residence in December 2005. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 78-79) After making \na few payments on this loan following the first mortgagee\u2019s foreclosure of its mortgage \ninterest, Applicant ceased making payments on the loan altogether. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 79-\n80) This debt was charged off by the lender in August 2019, with no activity noted in the \naccount since 2016. (GEs 2-4) \nApplicant\u2019s claims that this second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.h) was resolved with the \n2016 foreclosure of the first mortgage on the property are not corroborated by any \nevidence developed in the record. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 27, 29-30) Without any remaining sale \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproceeds from the 2016 foreclosure sale, SOR creditor 1.h became essentially a sold-\nout junior lien holder with no security left to recover its loan outlays. While this debt has \nfallen off of Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit report, it remains unresolved. (AE C; Tr. 34-35) \nIn 2017, Applicant filed a law suit against her former employer (SOR creditor 1.f) \nover a dispute involving her performance contract. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 81-83) In 2017 court \nproceedings, Applicant was denied the relief she sought and was assessed attorneys\u2019 \nfees of $5,397. After making two $200 payments to the judgment creditor under an \nagreement she reached with the creditor, she could no longer fit the monthly payments \nwithin her budget and ceased making payments. (AE N; Tr. 85-86; 112-113) Neither her \nbank statement nor her credit reports provide any updates or clarifications of the status \nof this judgment debt, and the debt remains unresolved. \nIn addition to her other mortgage debts, Applicant incurred a mortgage debt with \na small reported balance of $361 noted in her credit reports on a mortgage account \nreportedly opened in 2004 with SOR creditor 1.k. (GEs 2-4 and AE M) Before charging \noff the debt, SOR creditor 1.k canceled the remaining $361 charge on the mortgage and \nreleased the lien covering the charge on the mortgage (AE M) Based on the creditor\u2019s \nactions the SOR \u00b6 1.k debt is extinguished and resolved favorably to Applicant. \nSOR creditor 1.l covers a delinquent account with Applicant\u2019s current first \nmortgagee. The reported mortgage in Applicant\u2019s credit reports is a conventional \nmortgage on her current residence. Since October 2020, the mortgage has been in \nforbearance status. (AE C; Tr. 99) While she incurred recurrent delinquencies in the \naccount before the account was placed in forbearance, no payments are currently due \non the mortgage pending its return from Covid-19-based deferment. (GEs 2-4 and AE \nC; Tr. 98-99) Once the deferred loan is returned to active status, she is committed to \nresuming her $1,027 monthly payments. (Tr. 98-99, 112-113) Considering the \nsubstantial interest she has in the property and the underlying mortgage, Applicant can \nbe expected to resume her scheduled loan payments when they become due, \nFavorable resolution is warranted on this debt. \nMedical debts admitted by Applicant, but later challenged, are covered by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.i and 1.j. (GEs 1-4) Applicant challenges these charged-off debts without any \nexplanations of the legal basis of her disputes with the creditors. (Tr. 92) Both debts list \n$780 delinquent balances that Applicant claims are associated with her unplanned visits \nto the hospital in 2016 who delivered her stillborn baby. While these debts could be \nduplicates, they bear different account numbers and are not challenged by Applicant on \nduplication grounds. Without more information from Applicant on the facts and \ncircumstances of these debts, these medical debts remain unresolved. \nA final consumer debt listed in the SOR is covered by SOR \u00b6 1.m. This debt lists \na past-due account of $28 on an $897 balance that is reported as current in Applicant\u2019s \nAugust 2021 credit report. (AE C; Tr. 100) Inferences are warranted that this debt is \nresolved. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant earns $150,000 a year from her current employer and shares \nhousehold expenses with her significant other. (Tr. 52) She has a 401(k) retirement \naccount with approximately $200,000 in her plan. (Tr. 53) She has not received any \ndocumented financial counseling to date. Nor has she provided a monthly budget. With \nlittle reported savings to deal with her delinquent accounts, it is not clear what resources \nApplicant can expect to have on hand to address her still unresolved debts. (Tr. 52) \nWhile endorsements and performance evaluations might have been helpful in facilitating \na whole-assessment of Applicant\u2019s overall reliability and trustworthiness, none were \nfurnished. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \n8 \n\n \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent tax, \nconsumer, and medical debts over the course of many years. While most of the debts \ncovered by the SOR have been charged off, they raise trust, reliability, and judgment \nconcerns about her current and future ability to manage her finances safely and \nresponsibly. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (comprised of tax, consumer, and \nmedical debts) warrant the application of four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debts with explanations require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th ed. 2006). Her admitted debts are fully documented and create judgment issues as \nwell over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. \nSept. 24, 2004). Although she qualified her admissions with explanations, her \nadmissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed during the hearing. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited financial difficulties associated with her lengthy history of \ndelinquent debt accruals in connection with her federal and state taxes, consumer, and \nmedical accounts preclude her from taking advantage of most of the potentially \navailable extenuating and mitigating benefits. While some extenuating benefit to \nApplicant is warranted based on her reported periods of unemployment between 2015 \nand 2018, her personal obligations for her owed back federal and state taxes, \nconsumer, and medical debts remained outstanding and unresolved following her return \nto full-time employment in September 2018 and required her earnest attention. \nApplication of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies. While Applicant is able to \nfulfill the first prong of MC \u00b6 20(b) with her cited periods of unemployment, her failure to \nsatisfy the second prong (\u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) of MC 20(b) is \nconjunctive in its application and is the key prong that prevents her from gaining any \nmore than limited application of MC 20(b) \nSeveral of the allegations covered by the SOR are disputed by Applicant, notably \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i-1.j. SOR \u00b6.g covers Applicant\u2019s disputes over advertising charges \nbilled in 2014 by SOR creditor 1.g. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j cover disputed medical debts \ncharged her in 2016 by the same hospital creditor covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j. None \nof these raised disputes are supported by adequate contemporaneous documentation \ncovering the factual and legal bases of her disputes with these creditors. \nTo apply MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d it was incumbent upon Applicant to supply documented \nevidence of the nature of the dispute, the substantive basis of her claims and efforts on \nher part to resolve the dispute with the creditor before declining any further payments. \nWithout such evidence, MC \u00b6 20(e) is not available to her. Evidence provided by \nApplicant does not support the application of any of the other potentially available \nmitigating conditions. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, she has failed for the most part to take any documented \nvoluntary steps to address her accumulated delinquent federal and state tax, medical, \n11 \n\n \n \n \nand consumer debts and provide persuasive proof of her voluntary resolving these \ndebts. \nWhile Applicant is credited with making some voluntary payments on her 2013-\n2015 federal tax and 2015 state tax payment obligations, most of the tax and other \npayments were credited through involuntary levies on her scheduled tax refunds for \nother years. Debts reduced through involuntary initiatives, such as creditor levies, \nattachments, and foreclosures, generally do not meet the mitigation requirements of MC \n\u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Absent more evidence of voluntary payment \ninitiatives on Applicant\u2019s part to discharge her documented delinquent federal taxes for \ntax years 2013-2015, state taxes for tax year 2015, and the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f and 1.h-1.i, MC \u00b6 20(d) is not available to Applicant. \nThe Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to \nprovide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, \nwhether the issues relate to back taxes, consumer, medical, or other debts and \naccounts (inclusive of mortgages). See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. \n18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). For similar reasons, \npotentially applicable statutes of limitation and debts removed from credit reports for \nreasons other than payment or resolution by other voluntary means (to include \nmeritorious disputes of debts) cannot be equated with good-faith efforts to repay \noverdue creditors. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 (App. Bd. July 2005); ISCR \nCase No. 02-3030 at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 \n(App. Bd. June 2001). \nSimply because Applicant\u2019s credit card and mortgage debts no longer appear on \nher latest credit report, they cannot be credited as voluntarily paid or otherwise resolved \nthrough good-faith means. Debts removed from an applicant\u2019s credit report require \nindependent evidence of voluntary, good-faith payment efforts for debt resolution credit. \nTo date, Applicant has not provided any evidence of good-faith payments of these \ndebts. Based on the evidence developed to date in this administrative record, only four \nof the SOR-listed debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.k-1.m) merit resolution in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her work in the \ndefense industry, her efforts are not enough at this time to overcome her failures or \ninability to resolve her accumulated tax, mortgage, judgment, and medical debt \ndelinquencies with good-faith initiatives following her return to full-time employment in \nSeptember 2018. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been \nestablished. \nApplicant\u2019s past and present failures to address and resolve most of her \naccumulated tax, consumer (inclusive of mortgages and judgments), and medical debts \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nreflect adversely on her ability to maintain her finances in a sufficiently stable manner to \nmeet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. Based on a \nconsideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this case, it is too soon \nto make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake reasoned, good-faith \nefforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the foreseeable future. \nMore time is needed for her to establish the requisite levels of stability with her finances \nto establish her overall eligibility for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.k-1.m \nFor Applicant \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old. His last application for a security clearance was granted in 2020. He was married in 1998 and has two children. One of his children is an adult, and the other a minor. He served on active duty in the Army from 1997-2019. (Item 4) Applicant told a government investigator during his September 2018 background interview that he wanted to have his finances in order prior to retiring from the military in July 2019. He stated in his March 2022 SOR answer that he was not going to make excuses for his past financial decisions, and that he has tried to get back on his feet for the last two years after exiting the military. He stated that he is embarrassed by his past poor financial decisions, and that he is finally in a position to repair his wrongs. (Item 5) Applicant reported that his mother had cancer from about 2016-2019, and that he and his siblings had been providing her with some financial assistance.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant last submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 16, \n2017. On February 4, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. He \nresponded to the SOR on March 8, 2022, and requested a decision by an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on the administrative \n(written) record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn April 12, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) including Items 1-8. A complete copy of the FORM was \nprovided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He received the FORM \non April 19, 2022. A response was due on May 19, 2022, but none was received. The \ncase was assigned to me on, July 21, 2022. Items 1-3 are the SOR and Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer, which are the pleadings in the case. Items 4-8 are admitted without objection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g). His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. His last application for a security clearance was granted \nin 2020. He was married in 1998 and has two children. One of his children is an adult, \nand the other a minor. He served on active duty in the Army from 1997-2019. (Item 4) \nApplicant told a government investigator during his September 2018 background \ninterview that he wanted to have his finances in order prior to retiring from the military in \nJuly 2019. He stated in his March 2022 SOR answer that he was not going to make \nexcuses for his past financial decisions, and that he has tried to get back on his feet for \nthe last two years after exiting the military. He stated that he is embarrassed by his past \npoor financial decisions, and that he is finally in a position to repair his wrongs. (Item 5) \nApplicant reported that his mother had cancer from about 2016-2019, and that he \nand his siblings had been providing her with some financial assistance. He reported that \nthis impacted his ability to repay debt during this time period. He did not state how often \nor how much financial assistance he was contributing to her. (Item 4, 5) \nThe SOR alleges five charged-off debts totaling $55,365, and two debts in \ncollection, totaling $4,248. The status of the debts follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off in 2017 for $26,737. In his 2018\nbackground interview, Applicant stated that he fell behind on this debt because money \nbecame tight, then his mother had cancer. She needed financial assistance, and he \nwanted to help her out. In his answer, he stated he had monthly auto-pay on this account \nuntil November 2016. He reported that he fell two months behind and he could not catch-\nup with the required payments. The debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 6, 7, 8) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a motorcycle loan that was charged off in 2017 for $14,144. In his \n2018 background interview, Applicant stated that he fell behind on this debt because \nmoney became tight, then his mother had cancer, needed financial assistance, and he \nwanted to help her out. In his answer, he stated that he fell behind on his payments, and \ncould not catch up. He voluntarily surrendered the motorcycle in 2019. He claims that in \n2021, he tried to set up a payment plan to repay this debt, but he did not earn enough to \nbe able to afford it. The debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 6, 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a personal loan that was charged off for $9,564. In his answer, \nApplicant stated that because of his \u201cpoorly planned exit from the military,\u201d he was not \nable to make monthly payments, and fell behind. The debt is unresolved. (Item 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is an auto loan that was charged off in 2015 for $4,460. In his answer, \nApplicant stated that in 2016, this vehicle was totaled in an accident. His insurance \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \ncompany did not cover the full amount of the loss, and this debt is the remainder. The\ndebt is unresolved. (Item 7, 8) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a debt to a cellular phone service provider that was placed for \ncollection in the amount of $2,752. The debt is unresolved. (Item 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a debt to a cellular phone service provider that was placed for \ncollection in the amount of $1,496. In his 2018 background interview, Applicant stated \nthat he tried to turn off his cellular phone service before deploying overseas in 2014. He \nclaimed that he was told that he could, but when returned home, he was told that he owed \nthem $1100. He claimed that he paid $400 at the time, but provided no documentation to \ncorroborate his claim. The debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 6, 7, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a credit card that that was charged off for $460. In his answer, \nApplicant stated that he made arrangements to resolve this debt by March 30, 2022. \nHowever, he did not provide any documentation of either the payment arrangements with \nthe creditor or any payments made. (Item 6, 7) \nApplicant did not provide any documentation showing that any of his debts have \nbeen or are being paid, or otherwise resolved. He also submitted no documentation \nconcerning his current financial situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his \nassets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence that he has received \ncredit counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat any of alleged debts are resolved, or that any became delinquent under such \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. He failed to provide sufficient documentation of \nhis current financial situation or evidence which might establish his ability to address his \ndebts responsibly. His failure to pay his charged-off and delinquent debt is recent, \nongoing, and not isolated. This failure to meet his financial obligations continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant provided some financial assistance \nto his mother when she had cancer between about 2016-2019. However, some of the \nalleged debt became delinquent prior to her illness. He also did not resolve these debts \nafter the financial assistance ended. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat his debts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control or that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) could potentially apply to \u00b6 1.g. However, since Applicant did not \nprovide any documentation of either the payment arrangements with the creditor, or any \npayments made, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) could potentially apply to \u00b6 1.f. However, since Applicant did not provide \nany documentation showing that he disputed this debt with the creditor, AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s charged-off \nand delinquent debts under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. 54\u00ad\n55; AE D at 2) Applicant is paying the posted tax balances through the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy.

(GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 1) The last payment \nmade on the SOR 1.b home equity-loan was in October 2017. (GE 5 at 1) \nApplicant is 53 years. He has been married since June 1990. His wife has been \nemployed since 2009 as a grant-review associate for a federal government agency. (AE \nJ) He has two adult-aged sons, 29 and 25. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor as an auditing liaison since June 2017. (GE 2 at 6) He was previously \nemployed by a veteran\u2019s organization for five years. Applicant\u2019s only period of \nunemployment since 1992 was a four-month period from May to August 2012. (GE 1 at \n9-19) He served in the US Army from October 1986 to September 1989. (GE 1 at 20-\n21) He has held a security clearance since April 1985. (GE 1 at 38-39) \nDuring the security investigation between September 2016 and the September \n2020 hearing, Applicant provided several positions concerning the delinquent SOR 1.a \nmortgage. In his September 2016 e-QIP, Applicant indicated he had no delinquent \ndebts. (GE 1 at 40-41) This omission, along with other matters relevant to Applicant\u2019s \nreliability and judgment, were not alleged in the SOR and cannot form an independent \nbasis for denying or revoking his security clearance. However, I have considered the \nomission in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility and as a part of the whole-person analysis. \nSee, ISCR Case No. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017); ISCR Case No. 12-01038 \nat 3 (App. Bd. June 26, 2013) \nIn May 2018, Applicant provided a 13-page PSI regarding the two SOR \nmortgages and other matters. He incorrectly claimed that he continued to make \nmortgage payments to the SOR 1.a lender until November 2016, when he stopped, \nanticipating a short-sale cancelled by the lender in early 2017 without explanation. (GE \n2 at 5) See also, AE G at 9. Applicant stated that the subsequent foreclosure of the \nproperty was due to the cancelled short-sale and his inability to comply with the \ndemands of the lender to return the mortgage to a current status. (GE 2 at 5, 15) On the \nsecond to the last page of the PSI, Applicant briefly mentioned that he was experiencing \nfinancial hardship in June 2015, caused by helping his brother who was struggling \nfinancially to support his family. (GE 2 at 15-16) The investigator provided Applicant an \nopportunity to supply additional documentation about his delinquent debts discussed in \nthe PSI, but Applicant presented none.

He noted that no agreement had been made to pay either account, \nbut stated that he was in the process of filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (GE 3 at \n2, 4) \nIn his July 2019 SOR answer, Applicant claimed he began falling behind on his \nSOR 1.a mortgage and other bills in November 2015. As noted above, no additional \nmortgage payments were made after January 2015. (July 2019 answer to SOR; GE 4 at \n1) \nAt the September 2020 hearing, Applicant testified extensively about the \nongoing structural problems that he was supposedly having with his SOR 1.a home and \nhis efforts to fix the problems. Furthermore, he explained that his monthly mortgage \npayments were late because he purportedly used a portion of the SOR 1.a mortgage \nand the 1.b home-equity loan to pay for the home repairs. He testified about the layers \nof roof had been improperly added to the home, the leaking basement, the faulty air \nconditioning, and the damaged gutters that needed to be fixed. According to Applicant, \nit seemed there always some part of the home needing repair. (Tr. 13-17, 45) Yet, in his \nMay 2018 PSI, he never mentioned these recurring expenses for the home he had lived \nin from 1999 to February 2017. See GE 2. \nAt the September 2020 hearing, after claiming that he continued to make late \nmortgage payments to the SOR 1.a lender, Applicant admitted that he stopped the \n$1,600 payments shortly after January 2015. He was 47 years old at the time. (GE 1 at \n4) Instead, he testified that in the first three months of 2015, he gave $600 of the $1,600 \nmonthly mortgage to his destitute younger brother and his family. Applicant used the \nremaining $1,000 of the mortgage to help pay the rent for his brother\u2019s family who were \nliving with his mother-in-law. He claimed that he used the home-equity loan (SOR 1.b) \nto pay for additional home repairs, a student loan, and taxes. (Tr. 37-39) No \ndocumentation was furnished to corroborate the amount of money spent on his home, \nhis family, his student loan or his taxes. Moreover, there is no documentary evidence \nindicating that Applicant attempted to explain his financial situation to the SOR 1.a and \n1.b creditors and his intentions to resolve both debts.  \nAlthough the issue was not addressed in his May 2018 PSI (GE 2), Applicant \nexplained for the first time in his July 2019 answer about the financial burden caused by \nhis oldest son. He testified that he provided recurring financial support, including \npurchasing a car, to his oldest son and his family, and funding for his oldest son\u2019s \noccasional residential moves to various parts of the United States to maintain \nemployment. (Tr. 19-20, 31-35, 37-39) \nApplicant testified that his love for his family prompted him to stop paying the \nmortgage in early 2015 because his brother and oldest son needed financial help. He \ndoes not anticipate he will face similar circumstances in the future because his brother \nand oldest son have recovered from their financial difficulties.

No debt repayment plan was prepared. (AE B) In October \n2019, Applicant completed a personal financial management course approved by \nfederal bankruptcy laws. (AE C; Tr. 68) No additional financial counseling was \nmentioned by Applicant. When asked what he learned from the two financial courses, \nhe indicated that he found out how to structure his pay. He and his wife also learned \nabout \u201ckeeping our finances handled.\u201d (Tr. 68) With the instruction of the credit \ncounseling and his attorney, Applicant created a budget. He claimed that he has \nmaintained the budget since he has been in the bankruptcy case. (Tr. 68-69, 74) He \nbelieves that he is more mindful of his spending and \u201cwatching where our money is \ngoing.\u201d He and his wife pay closer attention to their bank accounts to guard against \noverspending. (Tr. 69) Applicant\u2019s testimony provides little insight into the exact steps \nhe has taken or adjustments he has made to watch how and where his money is spent \nand how he guards against overspending. \nApplicant\u2019s budget (AE J) does not have much probative value because it is a \nbankruptcy court form that is prepared for the bankruptcy court and trustee to determine \nwhether Applicant has sufficient disposable income to make recurring payments under a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition. More importantly, the budget was prepared in July \n2019, shortly after the Chapter 13 petition was filed, more than a year before the \nSeptember 2020 hearing. A personal budget is a financial tool that enables the debtor to \naccount and track his earnings and expenses. It informs him whether his spending \nmatches his financial objectives, i.e., not spending more than his earnings. Tracking his \nspending (which occurs by making notations every time he spends money) on a \ncontinuing basis enables him to ensure he is staying within those objectives. This \ntracking practice requires a personal budget to be revised and updated on a periodic \nbasis. Applicant provided no documented evidence indicating that he tracks his \nspending or has made appropriate adjustments to AE J in the last year. Applicant \npresented no current budget. He presented no credit bureau report to support his claim \nof having no other financial obligations. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant filed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2019. His Chapter 13 \nAmended Plan (March 19, 2020) lists two priority claims: (1) state agency claim \namounting to $1,426; (2) Internal Revenue Insolvency Operations and claim amounting \nto $7,667. The 2017 state and federal tax claims totaling $8,443 are income deductions \nfor his mortgage and property taxes that Applicant lost after he was evicted from his \nhome and moved into a rental. (Applicant viewed this eviction and move as the reason \nfor the two-year delay in filing the Chapter 13 petition in 2019. (Tr. 24)) The two priority \nstate and federal tax claims constitute the basis for the two additional allegations SOR \n1.c and 1.d. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on May 28, \n2020, after being denied on three previous occasions. The plan called for monthly \npayments of $2,000 for 36 months; then $2,556 a month for 24 months for a total period \nof 60 months. (AE A at 2, 3, 4, 6; AE E) The bankruptcy court submitted a payment \norder to Applicant\u2019s employer to deduct $2,000 from his monthly earnings and pay the \nbankruptcy trustee. After subtracting Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 planned monthly payment \nfrom his net monthly income, Applicant\u2019s net monthly income is reduced to $195. (AE D; \nAE F; AE J at 25) \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 payment record shows that between September 2019 \nand September 28, 2020, he made 15 plan payments totaling $28,000. From \nSeptember 2019 to May 2020, he was current with his Chapter 13 payments. In June, \nJuly and August 2020, he paid less than the $2,000 payment required under the plan, \nmaking him behind in payments. However, he paid more than the required plan amount \nwith multiple payments in August and September 2020. He explained that he had to \nmake extra monthly payments because his employer did not garnish his wages as \nrequired under the bankruptcy court\u2019s Employer Payment Order. (Applicant provided no \nexplanation why his employer was unable to establish the garnishment.) After adding all \ntrustee payments posted in AE K, Applicant payment plan was current as of his most \nrecent payment on September 26, 2020. (Tr. 50, 66-68; AE F; AE J; AE K) \nFor about five days in October 2015, October 2016, and July 2017, Applicant \nand his wife vacationed in several countries in the Caribbean. The trips, which included \naccommodations and meals, were gifts to Applicant from his travel agent. The only cost \nincurred by Applicant for these trips was about $1,000 in airfare for each trip. (Tr. 58-60) \nIn December 2019, Applicant and his wife drove to a southern port location in the U.S., \nwhere they took a cruise to four locations in the Caribbean. The total cost of the cruise \nwas about $2,500. (Tr. 61) \nCharacter Evidence \nOn September 24, 2020, Applicant\u2019s program manager indicated by character \nreference that he has supervised Applicant since September 2016. The manager \npraised Applicant\u2019s habit of dependably completing tasks in a trustworthy manner \nwithout supervision. The manager always observed Applicant act appropriately in social \nsituations. (AE L) \nIn a character reference dated September 23, 2020, an active member of the \nsame religious faith as Applicant, and his friend for 18 years, has gotten to know \nApplicant well as a husband, father, grandfather, and member of the same church. She \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s medical struggles and financial problems caused by family \nmembers. She also mentioned his unsuccessful financial undertakings. Applicant is an \nactive church member who ardently tries to improve himself, a sacred principle of the \nchurch. Neither the program manager nor Applicant\u2019s friend commented on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial habits. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \n18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial \ndistress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \n19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can normally meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) \nThe Government credit reports show that Applicant stopped paying his SOR \n1.a mortgage in January 2015 and his home-equity loan in 2017. Applicant finally \nacknowledged this fact at the September 2020 hearing after several misleading claims \nduring the security clearance investigation about when he stopped paying the mortgage. \nHis inconsistent statements significantly reduce Applicant\u2019s overall credibility. His 2020 \nChapter 13 Amended Bankruptcy plan includes a total of $8,443 in delinquent unpaid \nstate and federal taxes (SOR 1.c., 1.d). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s history \nof not paying his delinquent mortgage and home equity debts. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies to the \nunpaid state and federal taxes Applicant incurred by the loss of an income deduction for \nhis (SOR 1.a) mortgage and his property taxes. \n20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant encountered major financial problems in early 2015 because he \nvoluntarily decided to provide financial aid to his brother\u2019s family, and to provide \nfinancial help to his own son.

Given the absence of documented evidence showing \nattempts to keep either creditor aware of his financial situation until at least July 2019, \nwhen he filed his Chapter 13 petition, he receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) or the \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), and negligible mitigation under the second prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b). \nAccording to his July 2019 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed medical \nproblems in April 2016 prevented him from working. At the hearing, though he could not \nremember the medical issues in April 2016, but remembered his heart issue in January \n2018, which he surprisingly did not cite in his July 2019 answer. Without supporting \ndocumentation of any of the medical conditions, I do not find Applicant\u2019s medical claims \nto be credible. \nApplicant\u2019s financial counseling was mandated by the bankruptcy filed in July \n2019. There is no evidence that Applicant received any additional counseling or \nfinancial education. He did not adequately explain how the financial counseling courses \ntaught him how to structure his pay. He did not explain how he keeps a handle on his \nfinances, and pays closer attention to his bank accounts to guard against overspending. \nApplicant\u2019s budget (AE J) does not carry much probative weight for two \nreasons: (1) the budget is a bankruptcy form prepared to determine whether Applicant \nhad sufficient disposable income to make regular payments under the Chapter 13 plan; \nand (2) the budget was created over a year before the September 2020 hearing. \nTracking requires that a budget be continually revised to reflect the changes in income \nand spending. It is difficult to determine how Applicant\u2019s budget factored into his $2,500 \nvacation in December 2019, or whether Applicant had budgeted for the earlier vacations \nin 2015, 2016, and 2017, before he filed his 2019 bankruptcy petition. The first section \nof AG \u00b6 20(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s financial counseling mandated by the bankruptcy \ncourt. The second section of AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because of Applicant\u2019s failure \nto act on both debts until he filed his Chapter 13 petition in July 2019. \nWhether a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan represents a good-faith effort to satisfy \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, depends on the surrounding \ncircumstances of a particular case. The mitigation Applicant receives under AG \u00b6 20(d) \nmust be weighed against the facts that the SOR was filed on June 20, 2019, and the \nbankruptcy petition was filed on July 26, 2019, the same day that Applicant provided his \nanswer to the SOR. The timing of Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition suggests that he was \nresponding more to the security process than to his responsibility to meet his financial \nobligations in a timely manner. AG \u00b6 20(d) has limited application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been married since 1990 and has two adult-aged sons. He has \nbeen employed as an auditing liaison since June 2017. He was previously employed by \na veteran\u2019s organization for five years. His only period of unemployment was a four-\nmonth period from May to August 2012. Having supervised him since 2016, the \nprogram manager commended Applicant\u2019s practice of completing projects without \nsupervision. A friend, who has known Applicant for 18 years from their contact in the \nsame church and contact as a friend, is aware of Applicant\u2019s medical struggles and \nfinancial problems caused by family members. Applicant served in the US Army from \nOctober 1986 to September 1989. He has held a security clearance since 1985. \nBecause the security clearance decision must address the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s conduct, both favorable and unfavorable, given the fact that Applicant has \nheld a security clearance for 35 years, he knew or should have known that he could not \nsummarily stop paying his mortgage in early 2015, without having a standby plan in \nplace to ensure payment of his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements \nconcerning the status of the SOR 1.a creditor during the security investigation, including \nhis September 2016 e-QIP, his May 2018 PSI, his July 2019 answer to the SOR, and at \nthe September 20, 2020 hearing, undermine the credibility of his claim that financial \nproblems will not recur. Viewing the evidence from a commonsense point of view, \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Unfiled TY 2017 Federal tax return. Applicant did not receive a copy of his W-\n2 for TY 2017, following his discharge from the Navy during that tax year. After his \ndischarge, he no longer had access to an electronic copy of his W-2. He made several \nattempts to obtain the tax documentation from the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService, but was unsuccessful. As a result, he testified that he was unable to file his tax \nreturn for that year. Applicant believed that he was owed a refund for TY 2017 because \nhis only income that year was his Navy pay for seven months. After the hearing, he \nobtained from the IRS his \u201cForm W-2 Wage and Tax Statement\u201d for TY 2017. He \nsubmitted the Statement, which reflects that Applicant\u2019s gross income for that year was \nabout $12,000 and that he had paid withholding taxes of about $1,000. Applicant advised \nthat he used the information from the Statement to prepare and file his tax return for TY \n2017. This tax filing delinquency has been resolved. (Tr. at 30-34; AE M; AE N.) \n1.b. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $727. Applicant failed \nto pay this internet and cable account in 2015 while he was serving in the Navy and had \nrelocated to a new apartment. The debt was referred to a collection agency. Applicant \nworked with his mother to address debts on his credit report. His mother testified that \nApplicant paid a settlement of this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 34-38, 73; GE 4 at \n3; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.c. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $623. Applicant failed \nto pay this electric bill after he relocated in 2015. Applicant\u2019s mother believes that she and \nher son paid this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 38-39, 74; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4-5.) \n1.d. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $2,089. Applicant \nfailed to pay this account for a cellphone and cellular service in about 2015 or early 2016. \nApplicant and his mother settled this account in 2020 for less than the full amount. This \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. at 39-41, 72; GE 2; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.e. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $1,010. Applicant \nfailed to pay this account for a cellphone service in about 2016. Applicant does not recall \nif he paid this debt, but his mother testified that Applicant paid a settlement of this debt. \nThis debt is resolved. (Tr. at 42-44, 73; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.f. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $7,936. Applicant \ndefaulted on this auto-loan account with a credit union in 2017. He purchased the car in \nlate 2015 after returning from a deployment. His girlfriend at the time damaged the car in \nan accident. She did not have a driver\u2019s license. Applicant believed that a claim to repair \nthe car would not be covered by insurance. The car needed a safety inspection, and it \nwould have cost Applicant about $3,000 to repair the car so that it would pass the \ninspection. He stopped paying the car loan because he could not drive the car. He did \nnot return the vehicle to the dealer. He abandoned it and drove across the country with a \nfriend who had also been discharged from the Navy.

Under the terms of \nthis plan, the final payment is due September 18, 2034. He submitted a letter from the \ncreditor confirming the terms of the payment plan. Applicant has begun the process of \nresolving this debt. (Tr. at 45-51; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3; AE L.) \n1.g. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $2,108. Applicant \ndefaulted on this credit-card account with the same credit union as the lender referred to \nin 1.f, above. He opened this account when he was in Navy boot camp. He stopped paying \nthis account after his separation from the Navy. Applicant explained that he was in bad \nshape after leaving the Navy. His girlfriend had left him and his father had died in 2016. \nHe admitted that he acted immaturely by just ignoring his debts. After the hearing, \nApplicant entered into a payment plan with the creditor to begin making 17 bi-weekly \npayments of $100. He submitted a letter from the creditor confirming the terms of the \npayment plan. Applicant has begun the process of resolving this debt. (Tr. at 51-52; GE \n2 at 4; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 4; AE J.) \n1.h. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $1,415. After his \nseparation from the Navy and his loss of income, Applicant defaulted on this unsecured \npersonal loan account with the same credit union referred to above. After the hearing, \nApplicant entered into a payment plan with the creditor to repay this debt with 13 bi-weekly \npayments of $100. He submitted a letter from the letter from the creditor confirming the \nterms of the payment plan. Applicant has begun the process of resolving this debt. (Tr. at \n55-57; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 4; AE K.) \n1.i. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $2,954. In 2017 \nApplicant also defaulted on this unsecured personal loan account with the same credit \nunion. After the hearing, Applicant entered into a payment plan with the creditor to repay \nthis debt with 111 bi-weekly payments of $25. Under the terms of this plan, the final \npayment is due February 1, 2027. He submitted a letter from the creditor confirming the \nterms of the payment plan. Applicant has begun the process of resolving this debt. (Tr. at \n55-57; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 4; AE M.) \n1.j. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $7,579. Applicant took \nout this personal loan at a time he was living with his prior girlfriend, and they were living \nbeyond their means. He acknowledged that he was young and immature and did not know \nhow to manage his finances. He could not pay the loan payments and defaulted. After \ndefaulting, he chose to ignore this debt. Applicant\u2019s mother testified that she believes that \nshe and her son resolved this debt. Applicant may have paid this debt, but there is limited \nevidence that it is in fact resolved.

(Tr. at 58-59; \nGE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5; GE 5 at 4.) \nMitigation \nApplicant and his girl friend jointly have one credit card and a car loan. They pay \nboth accounts monthly. They use the credit card to purchase gas and repay the debt \npromptly. They do not carry a balance on the credit-card account. Now that he has a \nfamily to support, he takes his financial obligations seriously. He and his girlfriend budget \ntheir money every week and track their spending. They work hard to live within their \nmeans. His girlfriend works as a caretaker for a family member. They save money every \nmonth and now have about $6,000 or $7,000 in savings for emergencies. Applicant has \nreceived financial counseling from his mother. He also receives advice from his co-\nworkers who are financially successful. (Tr. at 59-69.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother also testified about her son\u2019s change in maturity as he has \nbecome responsible for his girlfriend, their child, and the girlfriend\u2019s other child. He has \n\u201cstepped up his game.\u201d His mother said that he loves his job and is trying to get his \nfinances resolved so that he can \u201cmove forward in life.\u201d She believes he took a big step \nby admitting to her that he had been irresponsible with his finances and asking for her \nadvice. She testified that they reviewed his credit report carefully. She then insisted that \nApplicant call each of his creditors in front of her and work out settlements, which she \nthen paid. She paid about $4,000 in total for the settlements Applicant was able to reach \nwith his creditors. In return for funding the settlements, she demanded that Applicant turn \nover his paychecks to her, and she gave him a small amount of spending money. She \nsaid that she was \u201cvery rough on him\u201d and did not \u201csugar coat\u201d anything. They addressed \nthe debts with the creditors that said the debts could still be paid and were told by some \ncreditors that the accounts were closed and were not payable at this time. The four credit \nunion debts discussed above were in this category. She concluded her testimony by \nsaying that she was very proud of her son and the mature man he has become. (Tr. at \n69-76.) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant advised that he contacted certain unidentified \ncollection agencies to make payment arrangements to resolve some of his remaining \ndebts. Other than the four credit union debts, he was unable to receive any documentation \nregarding these settlements prior to the extended record closure date. He also wrote that \nhe is applying for a second job to earn additional income to enable him to pay his \ndelinquent debts and to improve his overall finances. (AE O.) \nIn addition, Applicant submitted eight character letters in support of his case for \nmitigation. Several of the Navy leaders involved in the educational program on which \nApplicant works wrote to praise the effectiveness of the program. They also praised his \nvaluable contribution as an instructor. Applicant\u2019s manager wrote a detailed statement in \nwhich he noted Applicant\u2019s \u201ctireless work ethic, high level of integrity, steadfast reliability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nuncompromising standards, heartfelt values, and strict adherence to the Navy\u2019s core \nvalues of Honor, Courage, and Commitment.\u201d Two colleagues also wrote letters praising \nApplicant\u2019s professional expertise and character. (AE A through G.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required.    \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed a total of approximately \n$27,000 on ten past-due debts and had not filed his Federal income tax return for TY \n2017. Applicant\u2019s admissions in the Answer and the three most recent credit reports in \nthe record establish these facts. Accordingly, the foregoing disqualifying conditions are \napplicable, and the burden of proof shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his conduct. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements.  \n \n \nEach of the above mitigating conditions have some application to the facts of this \ncase. The debts became delinquent in 2017 under the unusual circumstances of \nApplicant\u2019s untimely separation from the Navy and his related loss of income. Of course, \nApplicant has himself to blame for using marijuana while serving in the Navy. These \ncircumstances are not likely to recur because Applicant ceased using illegal drugs after \nhis positive drug test in 2016, and he is now committed to working hard to protect his \nemployment and the financial security it provides for his family. Although Applicant did \nnot act responsibly at first, since he began his current job supporting the Navy and starting \na family, he has matured and taken responsibility for his delinquent debts. He has \nreceived financial counseling from his mother. Although she may not be a professional \ncounselor, she is an advisor with the authority and willingness to impose strict standards \nof financial responsibility on her son. Professional advisors lack such authority to ensure \ncompliance with their recommendations. \nThere are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved, \nboth with prior payments of debts and his plans to pay larger debts owed to the credit \nunion pursuant to his payment plans. Applicant also filed his delinquent tax return, once \nhe was able to access his W-2 information. He is applying to secure a second job to help \npay for his commitments to repay the credit union debts alleged in the SOR and any other \ndebts that may be still be outstanding. Under AG \u00b6 20(d) these efforts come too late in \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe process to qualify fully as being initiated in good faith, and his lack of a track record \nin making payments on the credit union\u2019s debts undercut full application of this mitigating \ncondition. However, viewing the facts of this case in their entirety, Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debts do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has carried his burden \nto establish mitigation with his evidence of personal growth and maturity and his \nresolution of certain debts, his filing of the TY 2017 Federal tax return, and his \nundertakings to resolve the remaining debts. Applicant\u2019s testimony was highly credible \nand he fully acknowledged his past immature behavior. He was \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d while \nserving in the Navy, having enlisted right after graduating from high school, and for a \nperiod after his separation in 2017. He has assumed adult responsibilities of supporting \na family, and he performs his job seriously and successfully. I am convinced that Applicant \nwill responsibly address his unpaid debt(s) pursuant to the payment plans he has entered \ninto, and resolve any other debts that remain outstanding. He has strong support from his \nmother, who knows how to administer \u201ctough love\u201d and has done so with her son to make \nsure he resolves his finances. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n                                  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since October 2015, as a weapons technician. Since 1995 he has worked for defense contractors as a weapons technician. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. He has never married and he has no children. He has held a security clearance since approximately 1995. (Item 3; AE A). The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2015 through 2017 federal income tax returns, as required, and that he owed $2,500 for delinquent taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). Applicant admitted in his January 2018 security clearance application (SCA) that he failed to file his 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. He also admitted owing $2,500 in delinquent federal taxes for years 2013 and 2014, and he claimed he had a payment plan with the IRS for these years, but he failed to document any plan. In his May 2019 personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator, he admitted not timely filing his 2015-2017 federal tax returns and owing delinquent taxes of $2,500 for tax years 2013 and 2014.

The FORM was received by Applicant on January 26, 2022. \nApplicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a one-page response to the FORM, which I \nhave marked as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. In AE A, he objected to two references made \nin the FORM, not to any specific piece of evidence, but to certain characterizations \nDepartment Counsel (DC) made in the body of the FORM. He objected to DC pointing \nout that he had not served in the military and that he had a gambling problem. Since, \nDC\u2019s comments in the FORM are not evidence, and will not be considered as such, \nApplicant\u2019s objections are overruled. Items 3-7 are admitted into evidence, as is AE A.  \nThe case was assigned to me on April 12, 2022. After receiving the case and \nreviewing the record, I gave Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ndocumentation because he made reference in AE A that he had tax documents that he \nwas not able to submit at that time. Applicant took advantage of this opportunity and \nsubmitted his IRS account transcripts for tax years 2015-2019. Those documents were \nadmitted as AE B-F. The email correspondence reflecting the re-opening of the record \nwas marked as administrative exhibit (ADE) I. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted some of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1k) and denied others \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.l-1.m). His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since October 2015, as a weapons technician. Since 1995 he has worked for \ndefense contractors as a weapons technician. He is a high school graduate and has \ntaken some college courses. He has never married and he has no children. He has held \na security clearance since approximately 1995. (Item 3; AE A). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2015 through 2017 federal \nincome tax returns, as required, and that he owed $2,500 for delinquent taxes for tax \nyears 2013 and 2014. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). Applicant admitted in his January 2018 security \nclearance application (SCA) that he failed to file his 2015 and 2016 federal income tax \nreturns. He also admitted owing $2,500 in delinquent federal taxes for years 2013 and \n2014, and he claimed he had a payment plan with the IRS for these years, but he failed \nto document any plan. In his May 2019 personal subject interview (PSI) with an \ninvestigator, he admitted not timely filing his 2015-2017 federal tax returns and owing \ndelinquent taxes of $2,500 for tax years 2013 and 2014. In his April 2021 answers to \ninterrogatories, he admitted not filing his 2015-2017 federal tax returns until April 2021. \nHis IRS tax account transcripts for tax years 2017 (filed in May 2021) and 2019 (filed in \nJuly 2020) showed that his tax refunds for those years were applied to his delinquent \n2013 federal tax debt (2017 refund amount applied: $2,022; 2020 refund amount \napplied: $1,210). Other than this information, he failed to document payment for his \ndelinquent federal tax debts for 2013-2014.

He also filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nJuly 2015 that was dismissed in February 2016. Applicant admitted these allegations in \nhis SCA, his PSI, and in his SOR answer. He explained that his Chapter 13 was \ndismissed because his plan payments were set too high and he could not make the \npayments. (Items 3-4, 7; SOR answer) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed six delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$21,000. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.k) Applicant admitted owing these debts in his SOR answer. The \ndebts are also supported by listings as delinquent debts in credit reports from January \n2018 and June 2020. Applicant claimed that he established payment plans for all these \ndebts. He failed to provide documentation showing such plans. He further explained that \nhe was unable to address his debts because of several personal setbacks for a period \nof time including, medical issues (e.g. multiple shoulder surgeries, eye surgery, and skin \ncancer removal), dealing with family deaths, and having to leave his home due to \ndrought conditions. All of the debts remain unresolved. (Items 3-6; AE A, SOR answer) \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s home foreclosure and some credit card \ndebt resulted from his gambling losses in the amount of approximately $50,000. It \nfurther alleged that Applicant continues to gamble. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.l-1.m) In his SOR answer, \nApplicant denied both of these allegations. In his January 2018 SCA, Applicant admitted \nthat he had gambling losses of $50,000, which left him unable to pay his bills on time, or \nat all. He claimed he has stopped gambling and sought professional help to do so. He \nfailed to provide any documentation concerning his medical assistance in this area. \n(Items 3-4; AE A; SOR answer) \nApplicant did not provide information about his current budget. Other than what \nmight have been required by his bankruptcy filings, there is no documented evidence \nshowing that he sought any financial counseling. (Items 3-7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused \nby gambling. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015-2017 federal income tax returns and he \nowes delinquent taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition in 2001, resulting in the discharge of his debts and he filed a 2015 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition, which was dismissed for failure to make his required payments. He \nalso has delinquent consumer debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. Because of his \ngambling losses he could not pay his debts, including making his mortgage payments. I \nfind all the above disqualifying conditions are raised, except for AG \u00b6 19(i) because the \nevidence supports that Applicant was open about reporting his gambling losses. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax\nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. He had several problems, such as medical issues, relatives passing away, and \ndrought conditions affecting his residence that were circumstances beyond his control. \nHowever, the evidence does not support that he has taken responsible actions to \naddress his debts or timely file his federal tax returns and pay the delinquent taxes he \nowes. He failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent debts. \nHe finally filed his 2015-2017 federal tax returns in May 2021, only after receiving the \nDOHA interrogatories requesting his tax information. AG \u00b6 20(b) does fully apply. Other \nthan what might have been required by his bankruptcy filings, there is no evidence of \nfinancial counseling and no evidence that his financial conditions are under control. He \nhas not shown a good-faith effort to address his debts or his federal tax issues. While \nhe filed his 2015-2017 tax returns several years late, there is no documentary evidence \nshowing he made arrangements with the IRS to resolve his tax debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and \n20(d), and do not apply. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a, but not to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.m based upon his assertion that he no longer \ngambles and that there is no evidence in the record to the contrary. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his medical and family \nissues, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts, his failure to \ntimely file his 2015-2017 federal income tax returns, and his failure to document any \nvoluntary payment towards his delinquent federal tax debt from 2013 and 2014. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, February 20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F and E. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn September 3, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing.

On April 6, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for April 27, 2022. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits into evidence. \nI held the record open until May 27, 2022, to afford Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional evidence. (Tr. 63-65) Applicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C, which I admitted without objection. On May 5, 2022, DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.). \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.k; and 2.a and 2.b. In his SOR response, he also provided mitigating \ninformation. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 32-year-old warehouse specialist, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since September 2018. This is his first application for a security \nclearance, and he seeks a clearance to enhance his position within his company. (Tr. 12-\n14, 60-61; GE 1)  \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2008. (Tr. 14-15) He was previously \nmarried from June 2010 to December 2015. That marriage ended by divorce. Applicant \nremarried in May 2016. (Tr. 15-17; GE 1) He has three minor children, and a minor \nstepdaughter. Applicant\u2019s wife receives child support for his stepdaughter. Applicant\u2019s \noldest child is from his first marriage. He pays his former spouse $137 a month in child \nsupport for that child. His second child is from a former relationship, and he provides for \nthat child\u2019s health insurance, but does not pay child support. Applicant has shared custody \nwith the mothers of his two oldest children. His third child was born during his current \nmarriage. All four children live with Applicant and his wife. His spouse does not work \noutside the home. (Tr. 17-20, 40, 62-63; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe SOR lists 11 allegations under this concern. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k allege \nvarious debts, all of which are discussed in further detail below. These allegations are \nestablished by his March 4, 2020 SF-86, his June 26, 2020, December 15, 2020, and \nMarch 31, 2022 credit reports; his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Report of \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInvestigation conducted from July 2, 2020 to July 14, 2020 to include an OPM Personal \nSubject Interview (PSI) on July 9, 2020; and his September 3, 2021 SOR Answer. \nApplicant stated that he got into financial difficulty \u201caround a year after my first -\u00ad\nor my divorce\u201d . . . [s]o around 2016.\u201d (Tr. 20-21) He found it financially challenging to \nmaintain two residences after he moved out of the residence he shared with his first wife. \nHe opened up \u201ca couple of cards -- credit cards . . . and I wasn\u2019t making enough money \nto balance all those, and it just started getting in the hole from there and it just got deeper \nand deeper.\u201d (Tr. 21-22) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s July 9, 2020 OPM PSI, he stated that he was willing and able \nto pay all his bills and debts. He committed to look into any unknown accounts and pay \nany applicable balance within two years. The OPM investigator gave Applicant the \nopportunity to provide documentation regarding his financial delinquencies. The \ninvestigator noted that Applicant failed to provide documentation during his interview or \nsubsequent to his interview to corroborate his disagreement with accounts in his credit \nreport. (GE 2) Later, Applicant stated that he has \u201ctaken care of everything that I promised \nI would. The other debts that are listed, I admitted to them and then I have not done \nanything towards those because they are so \u2013 they are past the statute of limitations, and \nI\u2019ve taken care of the ones that were on my credit as collections \u2013 that were outstanding.\u201d \n(Tr. 22-23) \nThe February 20, 2021 SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$22,850 as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $6,936 charged-off debt for a voluntary vehicle \nrepossession. Applicant was unable to remain current on his car payments, and he \nvoluntarily returned his car to the creditor in 2018. (Tr. 23-25) He has made no effort to \naddress this debt.

He has made no effort to address this debt. (Tr. 28-29) DEBT NOT \nRESOLVED. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $2,794 charged-off department store account. He opened \nthis account when he got divorced and used it \u201cfor groceries or clothing for my kids.

(Tr. 36-37; SOR Answer) DEBT \nRESOLVED. \nApplicant stated that he had no intention of addressing any of the unpaid debts \nbecause, \u201cI was advised (by a family friend) that they are past the statute of limitations. \nSo if I were to reopen all of these, they would go back onto my credit and put in collection \naccounts, which I heard is more.\u201d (Tr. 37) Department Counsel advised Applicant that in \nthe security clearance process, the Government was not just concerned about legal \ntechnicalities of collectability or not, but rather whether an applicant addresses things for \nwhich they are responsible. (Tr. 38) I reiterated what Department Counsel advised \nApplicant adding that waiting until his debts fell off his credit report was not a responsible \nway to address his financial situation. (Tr. 58-59, 66-69) I inquired whether he wanted to \nleave things as they were or take additional corrective action. He replied, \u201cNo, if it will \ndefinitely help me, I will definitely take care of stuff.\u201d (Tr. 58) \nWhen asked whether he had the means to address his delinquent debts, Applicant \nresponded, \u201cif it will better my chances for my future, then, yes, I will definitely take \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactions.\u201d (Tr. 38-39) Applicant added, that ever since his OPM PSI, \u201cI have taken care of \nthe ones (debts) that I saw were in outstanding collections since the interview and all my \ncurrent revolving debt that I have is on time and paid in full every time.\u201d (Tr. 39) Applicant \nhas not received any financial counseling. He discussed financial counseling with his \nfamily and friends, but they told him it would \u201ccost a lot of money just to get some financial \ncounseling.\u201d (Tr. 39, 44-45) He stated that he has made changes in his spending habits \nto include spending \u201cwhat I know I can spend.\u201d He has also placed small lines of credit \non the credit cards that he does have. (Tr. 39-40) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take home pay is \u201c[a]round $3,200.\u201d His monthly rent is $1,250, \nhis monthly car payments are $750 for a 2019 Chevrolet Suburban, his monthly internet \nservice is $80, his monthly child support garnishment is $137, and he estimates his \nmonthly utilities are approximately $150.

Applicant estimates his monthly \ncredit card bills are approximately $100. He usually spends his entire take home pay to \ncover his bills. Any money that he has left after paying his bills goes into his savings \naccount. Applicant has approximately $3,500 in his savings account. He has a 401(k) \nretirement account through his employer, but he does not know the balance of his \naccount. (Tr. 40-44, 61) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR lists two allegations under this concern. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege two \nterminations from two separate employers in 2017 and 2018, which are discussed in \nfurther detail below. These allegations are established by his March 4, 2020 SF-86, GE \n1 and 2, his September 3, 2021 SOR Answer, and his hearing testimony. Applicant initially \nself-reported both of these allegations on his March 4, 2020 SF-86. The only evidence \ndeveloped regarding these two allegations was derived from Applicant\u2019s March 4, 2020 \nSF-86, his July 9, 2020 OPM PSI, and his hearing testimony. There is no Government \nevidence to refute or corroborate Applicant\u2019s version of the facts regarding these two \nterminations. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was terminated in April 2018 from his \nposition as a maintenance technician at an apartment complex for violating the \nterms of his employment by participating in an on-site, after-hours party. Applicant \nhad a job at this apartment complex as a resident maintenance technician for which he \nreceived an hourly wage and lived at the complex at a reduced cost. (Tr. 49-50) \nWhile employed at this apartment complex, Applicant had befriended \u201ca couple of \nmy neighbors, and they weren\u2019t the best neighbors to everyone else.\u201d (Tr. 50) These \nneighbors had an after-hours party that became loud and boisterous. Applicant had been \ninvited to attend this party, but declined because he had to take his wife to the hospital \nfor induced labor. Applicant was later accused by one of the apartment residents of \nattending that party. Applicant informed his supervisor that he was at the hospital with his \nwife at the time of this boisterous party. The complaining neighbor showed the apartment \ncomplex management pictures of Applicant that she had purportedly taken of him \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nattending this party. However, Applicant pointed out that the pictures were of him \nattending a daytime children\u2019s birthday party at the neighbors versus attending the \nboisterous party in question. (Tr. 50-51, 55-58)  \nThe terms of Applicant\u2019s employment did not prohibit him from socializing with his \nneighbors, but preclude his off-duty behavior from participating in or causing a \ndisturbance. Applicant protested his termination with a \u201cmaintenance supervisor,\u201d but was \ninformed by the supervisor, \u201cMy hands are pretty much tied.\u201d (Tr. 51) Applicant was \nunable to offer an explanation as to why this complaining neighbor tried to implicate him \nstating, \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure, but one \u2013 but from the angles of the pictures that \nthey\u2019re coming from, it was \u2013 this lady \u2013 and I was really nice always to her and she would \nalways ask for me to come into her apartment, so I\u2019m not sure what I did to her. . ..\u201d (Tr. \n52, 55-58) Applicant had never been counseled or received formal write-ups while \nemployed at this apartment complex. (Tr. 52) Applicant cannot understand why he had \nthese issues because as he explained, \u201cI\u2019m a very type of people person, too, but I guess \nthat\u2019s how my family is.\u201d (Tr. 53) \nApplicant was given the choice of being terminated or leaving by mutual \nagreement. Applicant chose to leave by mutual agreement because he already had a \nbetter paying job at a plumbing company and by leaving voluntarily his supervisor offered \nto act as a reference for him. Note \u2013 Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding this incident is \nconsistent with what he told the investigator during his July 9, 2020 OPM PSI. (GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant was terminated in February 2017 from his \nposition as a maintenance technician at an apartment complex for stealing a \nrefrigerator. Applicant had a job at this apartment complex as a resident maintenance \ntechnician for which he received an hourly wage and lived at the complex rent-free. He \nhad worked there for \u201cabout two years.\u201d Management was remodeling the complex with \nall new appliances, flooring, and lighting. The appliances removed from the apartments \nwere placed by the dumpster to be hauled away by the \u201clocal junk guy.\u201d Also, various \npeople would \u201ccome and just pick \u2018em up and take \u2018em home or whatever they did with \n\u2018em \u2013 sell \u2018em.\u201d (Tr. 45-47, 53-55) \nApplicant\u2019s father saw the old refrigerators sitting by the dumpster and asked him \nif it would be possible for him to secure one of the old refrigerators for him to use in his \ngarage. Applicant assured his father that he could do that and one Friday after work he \nloaded an old refrigerator onto his truck and drove it to his father\u2019s house. Applicant\u2019s \nmanager called him into the office the following week and informed him that one of the \ntenants had taken a picture of Applicant driving off the property with the refrigerator on \nhis truck. Applicant acknowledged that was indeed correct and that he had removed an \nold refrigerator by the dumpster and taken it to his father\u2019s garage. At that point, \nApplicant\u2019s manager terminated him for removing stolen property from his worksite and \ngave him 30 days to vacate his apartment. (Tr. 46-47, 53-55) \nApplicant stated that it was common practice to remove parts from old appliances \nplaced by the dumpster for future use.

(GE 2) \nCharacter Evidence \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted two work-related reference letters from his \nproduction control managers. Both managers highly endorse Applicant. They describe \nhim as highly motivated, trustworthy, dependable, competent, and hard-working. They \nview him as an upwardly mobile employee capable of greater responsibility. Both \nmanagers recommend Applicant for a security clearance. (AE A, AE B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nId. (internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced a financial shortfall around the time of his divorce in 2016 \nand found it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain two households on his income. In an \nattempt to remain afloat, he opened up credit card accounts to cover his expenses; \nhowever, he was unable to remain current on those accounts. These are circumstances \nlargely beyond his control, which adversely affected his finances. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Another component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. There is no record evidence that Applicant made contact with any of his \ncreditors for his unresolved debts, but rather chose to wait for them to \u201cfall off his credit \nreport.\u201d \nApplicant is credited with mitigating the following SOR debts: \u00b6 1.g for $749; \u00b6 1.h \nfor $749; \u00b6 1.i for $680; \u00b6 1.j for $297; and \u00b6 1.k for $105. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are \npartially applicable as it pertains to these delinquent debts. The personal and family \nproblems that Applicant described surrounding his divorce in the 2016 timeframe played \na role in his ability to remain current on his financial obligations. However, Applicant does \nnot receive full credit under either of these two mitigating conditions because of his failure \nto act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) are not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-payment of several of his SOR debts has important \nsecurity implications. See ISCR Case No. 20-01004 at 3 (App. Bd. June 28, 2021) \n(\u201cResolution of a delinquent debt does not preclude further inquiry or examination \nregarding it. Even if an alleged debt has been paid or canceled, a Judge may still consider \nthe circumstances underlying the debt as well as any previous actions or lapses to resolve \nthe debt for what they reveal about the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance\u201d) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017)). Even if he paid the delinquent \nSOR debts after receipt of the SOR, this would not automatically mitigate security \nconcerns. \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened. \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). \nOne function of an SOR is to place an Applicant on notice of a particular security \nconcern, such as finances and delinquent debts. A financially based SOR provides an \nApplicant an opportunity to show good faith and establish payment plans, pay debts, or \notherwise mitigate security concerns. An Applicant who is insensitive to the importance \nof compliance with promises to repay borrowed funds and to expeditiously resolve \nsecurity concerns may not diligently act to safeguard security. \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make more progress sooner in \nthe resolution of several of his SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance that his financial \nproblems are being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations security concerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that that individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), and 16(e) as potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. This evidence shifts the burden to Appellant to establish \nmitigation. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes three conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(e), and (g) are applicable. These two terminations occurred in \nFebruary 2017 and April 2018. The 2017 termination involved \u201cstealing\u201d a refrigerator and \nthe 2018 termination involved attending a boisterous after-hours party in violation of his \nterms of employment. Since September 2018, Applicant has been gainfully employed by \nhis present defense contractor employer. \nI note that Applicant self-reported these terminations on his March 4, 2020 SF-86. \nHe discussed or acknowledged them during his July 9, 2020 OPM PSI, in his September \n3, 2021 SOR Answer, and during his hearing testimony. His version of the facts remained \nconsistent. The Government did not present any evidence to rebut or contradict \nApplication\u2019s version of these two terminations. Lastly, I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredible. He did not contest his terminations in any formal manner choosing rather to \nmove on and put them behind him. That said, given the facts surrounding each of these \nterminations, it appears the circumstances surrounding each termination was relatively \nminor and sufficient time has elapsed without any similar recurrence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old warehouse specialist, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since September 2018. He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance, and he seeks a clearance to enhance his position within his company. He is \nmarried and has four minor children living in his home, three of his own children of which \nhe shares custody with two separate mothers, and a stepdaughter. His management \nholds a high opinion of him and recommends him for a clearance. \nAlthough Applicant mitigated the personal conduct concerns, he was unable to \nmitigate the financial considerations concerns. The February 20, 2021 SOR alleges 11 \ndelinquent debts totaling $22,850. Applicant did not make any payments after receipt of \nthe SOR to address six SOR debts. Based on advice received from friends and family, \nhis strategy has been and apparently remains to wait for his debts to fall off his credit \nreport. Department Counsel and I explained to him that this is not an acceptable means \nof debt resolution and does not establish mitigation for security clearance purposes. His \nunresolved debts have remained delinquent since 2016. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

I \nreceived in evidence three Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 3) and nine Applicant exhibits \n(AE A \u2013 AE I), and I considered the testimony of Applicant. Also, I took administrative \nnotice, at Department Counsel\u2019s request, of a discovery letter, dated June 24, 2021, \nidentified as Hearing Exhibit I. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 15, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 27-year-old single man. He graduated from college summa cum laude \nin 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering. (Tr. 34; AE G) Since then, he has been \nworking for a defense contractor as an engineer. Currently, he works in a program where \nhe rotates among different positions within the company. (Tr. 15) \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use and drug involvement. He used marijuana, \ncocaine, ketamine, and another hallucinogen, unidentified by name in the record. (GE 2 at \n6) He also abused prescription drugs. He began smoking marijuana a few times per week \nin high school at age 15. (GE 3 at 6) On a few occasions in high school, he purchased \nmarijuana. (GE 2 at 8) He used marijuana from about January 2010 to July 2019. His \nmarijuana use gradually decreased over time. Between 2015 and 2019, he used the drug \nfewer than ten times. (GE 1 at 35) \nApplicant used cocaine, on average once every six months and never more often \nthan once a month. (GE 2 at 6) In total, he used cocaine approximately 25 times over six \nyears, beginning in 2014. He has not used any cocaine since February 2020. (GE 2 at 6) \nApplicant began using hallucinogens in 2011 at age 17. (Tr. 22; GE 1 at 37) He \nbegan misusing prescription drugs in 2014. (GE 2 at 6) Applicant used an unidentified \nhallucinogen about eight times between 2011 and 2013. He used ketamine approximately \nfive times in 2015, and he misused depressants approximately six times between 2014 and \n2015. He has not used any of these types of drugs since 2015. (GE 2 at 6) Applicant used \nillegal drugs recreationally at parties and other social gatherings. (Tr. 17) \nApplicant stopped taking illegal drugs because he \u201cknew that [he] wanted to obtain \nan engineering job and the prospects [sic] of [a] career [was his] first priority.\u201d (GE 2 at 7) \nApplicant characterized his use as casual. It occurred in social situations. (GE 2 at 7) \nIn March 2021, Applicant enrolled in a random drug testing program. Between \nMarch 2021 and August 2021, he took six random tests. The first test was a hair follicle \ntest and the remaining tests were urinalyses. All of the results were negative. (AE A \u2013 AE \nF) \nApplicant still associates with people who use drugs.

According to his supervisor, he is \u201cthe \u2018go\u00ad\nto\u2019 engineer that stands out among a team of excellent employees.\u201d (AE I) In December \n2021, Applicant received special recognition for his \u201ctireless work ethic,\u201d and his impressive \nwork, which made operations run more efficiently. (AE H) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nUnder AG \u00b6 24, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Applicant\u2019s history of drug abuse triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance misuse.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment of his drug use and his voluntary enrollment in a drug-\ntesting program triggers the application of AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. . .\u201d However, \nApplicant still occasionally socializes with his old friends and acquaintances who use drugs. \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts,\u201d does not apply. Applicant testified that he will step outside if friends or \nacquaintances are smoking marijuana. This is not sufficient to constitute \u201cchanging or \navoiding the environment where drugs are used,\u201d under AG \u00b6 26(b)(2). I conclude this \nmitigating condition is inapplicable. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement occurred during his high school and college years. His \nlast use was in February 2020. After graduating from college summa cum laude, Applicant \ntook a job with his current employer, and he has excelled. In addition, he voluntarily \nenrolled in a random drug-testing program, the month before the issuance of the SOR, and \nhe passed every test that was administered through August 2021, the last record \nsubmission. These accomplishments and positive steps bolster the credibility of Applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he has no intention of using illegal drugs or misusing legal drugs in the \nfuture. On balance, the passage of time since the last drug use, Applicant\u2019s graduation \nfrom college with the highest honors, and his outstanding work history outweigh the \nnegative inference generated by his occasional association with friends who use drugs. He \nis not likely to jeopardize his defense-contractor employment by resuming any illegal drug \nuse. AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI weighed the whole-person factors in my analysis of the mitigating and disqualifying \nconditions. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress based on \nApplicant\u2019s past drug use is minimal. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the drug \ninvolvement security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old. She was married in 2010 and divorced in 2013. She remarried in 2021, and has two young children with her second husband. She has been employed as an airplane mechanic by a defense contractor since 2019. She served on active duty in the Navy from 2010-2015. She was deployed three times during this period. She served in the Navy Reserves from 2015-2022, and received an honorable discharge. She has held a security clearance since about 2011. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2017, and several trade school certificates in 2020. (Tr. 17 \u2013 26; GE 1) Applicant stated that her financial problems started in her early 20s after joining the Navy. She was immature, and made some poor financial decisions because of her youth and inexperience. In 2013, she separated from her first husband. While she was on deployment, he ran up charges on her credit card, stole almost all of her possessions out of her apartment, and emptied her bank account. He also absconded with a vehicle that they jointly owned. When they divorced later that year, he was in prison.

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review \nof the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact: \nApplicant is 34 years old. She was married in 2010 and divorced in 2013. She \nremarried in 2021, and has two young children with her second husband. She has been \nemployed as an airplane mechanic by a defense contractor since 2019. She served on \nactive duty in the Navy from 2010-2015. She was deployed three times during this \nperiod. She served in the Navy Reserves from 2015-2022, and received an honorable \ndischarge. She has held a security clearance since about 2011. She earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2017, and several trade school certificates in 2020. (Tr. 17 \u2013 26; \nGE 1) \nApplicant stated that her financial problems started in her early 20s after joining \nthe Navy. She was immature, and made some poor financial decisions because of her \nyouth and inexperience. In 2013, she separated from her first husband. While she was \non deployment, he ran up charges on her credit card, stole almost all of her \npossessions out of her apartment, and emptied her bank account. He also absconded \nwith a vehicle that they jointly owned. When they divorced later that year, he was in \nprison. (Tr. 34-43, 97) \nIn 2015, after Applicant left active duty service with the Navy, she was unable to \nfind gainful employment. She had several jobs at a time earning minimum wage, and \nwas living paycheck to paycheck. She stated that she was barely able to afford her \nmonthly expenses, and was unable to resolve outstanding debts until she obtained \nbetter employment. She finally obtained employment in her career field as an airplane \nmechanic in 2019. She is now earning about $71,000 annually. (Tr. 34-43, 87-91) \nIn 2020, when her finances stabilized, Applicant started researching how to \nrepair her credit and resolve her debts. She stated that she did her best not to incur new \nunnecessary debt. Through a finance-related podcast, she found a credit repair group \nthat provided financial counseling and other specific guidance to members for minimal \ncost. She used the information that she learned to start making settlement offers to her \ncreditors, and requested debt validations for accounts that she believed were \nfraudulent. She has been using this method to address the debts listed on the SOR. (Tr. \n26-28, 32-33, 82-84, 94) \nIn 2017, Applicant became seriously ill while pregnant. This created loss of \nwages and financial hardships. When she became pregnant again in 2021, she took \nproactive financial measures, anticipating that she would be unable to work for a period \nof time. She prepaid some of the family\u2019s monthly bills six months ahead, to include car \npayments, so she and her husband would not be at risk for default or repossession. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis expense took away from her ability to resolve some delinquent debt. (Tr. 40-46, 49-\n59)  \nApplicant submitted a monthly budget. It shows that she and her husband are \nable to meet their monthly expenses, and pay debts. Their biggest monthly expenses \nare for child care and their vehicle payments. While costly, she was able to credibly \nexplain why her family needed the used SUV she purchased in 2021. In 2022, she has \nalready paid about $1,200 of medical debt from her 2021 pregnancy and delivery; about \n$3,000 of her husband\u2019s debt; and settled two of the SOR debts. (Tr. 42-43, 71-82, 87-\n91, 96; AE A-H)  \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts, totaling about $30,000, as well as a \nsuspension of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in 2011, for financial reasons. The status \nof the debts are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card that has been charged-off for $8,207. Applicant stated \nthat she incurred this debt in 2015 when the transmission went out in her vehicle. While \nthe repair was costly, it was less expensive than acquiring a new vehicle. Since her \nsavings were limited, she charged the repair cost to her credit card. After leaving the \nNavy, she stated that she was struggling to earn enough money to cover her basic \nexpenses, so she stopped paying her credit card. She contacted the creditor to settle \nthis debt. She provided documentation showing that she paid the negotiated settlement \noffer. The debt it is now resolved. (Tr. 34-41; AE F, G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is student-loan debt placed for collection for $19,187. Applicant stated \nthat she did not defer her student loan repayments while she was in school or \nafterwards, because neither the lender or her school\u2019s financial aid department advised \nher that was possible. When she contacted the lender, she was offered an income-\nbased repayment plan that she could not afford at the time. Once her finances \nstabilized, she contacted the lender to rehabilitate the loan. In 2021 she made some \n$109 monthly payments, and her current monthly payments are $220. Her intent is to \nconsolidate the debts into one loan. She has also applied for loan forgiveness for part of \nthe balance, and has a plan to resolve this debt in the near future. (Tr. 29-30; 53-63; AE \nA) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card that was placed for collection for $1,228. Applicant \nstated that this account was likely the result of fraud, and she has contested this debt. \nShe currently has another credit card account with this creditor in good standing. She \nasked for debt validation for this account, and the creditor provided invalid personal \ninformation. She also claims that she made a settlement offer several months ago to get \nit off her credit report, and never received a reply. She has not received further \ncorrespondence form the creditor. (Tr. 30-31, 63-67; GE 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a debt in collection for $675. It was a store credit card that her ex-\nboyfriend used to purchase clothes for himself. Applicant contacted the creditor and \nsent them a settlement offer. This debt is now resolved.

Applicant has \nresolved this debt. (Tr. 31, 69-70; AE D, H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that Applicant had her security clearance suspended for \nfinancial reasons in 2011. While this is accurate, she appealed the Navy Central \nAdjudication Facility\u2019s (CAF) decision, and her clearance was reinstated. Applicant \nstated that she worked with a Navy attorney to resolve the case. They submitted \ndocumentation showing that she contested the majority of accounts on the SOR, \nbecause they were fraudulent, and these creditors were unable to validate these debts. \nShe admitted responsibility for some of the debts, and took action to resolve them at \nthat time. She was told by the Navy CAF in October 2011 to continue to meet her \nfinancial obligations. The debts from 2011 were not connected to her later financial \nproblems. (Tr. 34-43, 97; GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nApplicant\u2019s debts are largely due to circumstances beyond her control, including \nher inability to find gainful employment after leaving the Navy, illness during pregnancy, \nand hard financial choices she had to make when she had limited income. All of these \nevents caused a personal and financial strain that impacted her ability to address her \ndebts. The record clearly shows that for the last two years, she has been responsibly \nmanaging her finances; sought professional financial advice; made efforts to resolve \ndelinquent debt; and has a plan to resolve the balance of her student loans, which is her \nlast remaining SOR debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) apply. \nSimilarly, Applicant provided sufficient evidence that she has undertaken good-\nfaith efforts to address her debts. She has contacted her creditors to verify her debts \nand make settlement offers. She has paid the debts as quickly as she has been able. \nShe has taken the proper measures to dispute an account that she credibly believed \nwas fraudulent. Applicant is not required to show that she has paid or resolved all of her \ndebts, or that she has done so in any particular way. She need only show that she has a \nreasonable plan in place to resolve her debts, and that she has taken steps towards \nimplementing it. Applicant has done so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) applies. \nIn her testimony, Applicant repeatedly stressed that her poor financial decisions \nand the bad financial circumstances of her past, reflect a much younger and less \nexperienced person. She is now more mature, reliable, and knowledgeable than the \nperson who got into financial trouble seven years ago. Her personal and professional \nlife are now stable.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I considered her military service, performance \nreview, and letters of recommendation highlighting her character, trustworthiness and \nreliability. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nApplicant established that all of her SOR debts are being paid or are otherwise \nresolved. She has contacted creditors, and made payment arrangements, where \npossible. She has been responsibly managing her finances, made efforts to resolve \ndelinquent debt, and has a plan to resolve her remaining debt in the near future. \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent due to circumstances beyond her control, \nincluding a divorce and employment instability. Given her service with the Navy, and her \ngood faith efforts in resolving her debts, I believe that she has met her burden of \nmitigating the financial considerations security concerns arising out of her delinquent \ndebts under Guideline F. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

On February 5, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \ndetailing \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations.

DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 7, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 61 years old and is unmarried with no children. \nHe has an \nAssociate\u2019s degree. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR identified three allegations. Applicant failed to timely file his Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2019. He failed to timely file his state (A) \nincome tax returns for those same years. He also failed to timely file his state (B) \nincome tax returns for tax year 2015. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth \nin the SOR, and states that he is expecting a refund when they are filed. Applicant \nbegan working for his current employer in 1982, and has had continuous employment \nwith his company for 40 years. He applied for his first security clearance about 38 or 39 \nyears ago.  (Tr. p. 16.) \nIn about 1989, Applicant joined a professional group of engineers. In about 1990 \nor 1991, he was told by an ex-registered agent of the IRS who was in the group that if \nApplicant had no tax liability, he would have three to five years to file his income tax \nreturns to get his refund back. It was not until Applicant\u2019s father passed away in 2001 or \n2002 that Applicant began having trouble getting his income taxes filed. He stated that \nhe was overwhelmed with his father\u2019s estate, as he was the executor of the will.  \nApplicant just did not have the time to get everything done. Applicant testified that he \nalways understood that he was required to file annual income tax returns regardless of \nwhether he was going to receive a tax refund. (Tr. p. 23.)  \nApplicant admitted that at least twice in the past, he has taken the time to catch \nup on his past-due income tax filings when he is forced to fill out a security clearance \napplication during his security clearance renewals. The first time it occurred was in \n2013. As part of his security clearance update, Applicant had to complete a security \nclearance application, and that time he filed his past-due income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011 and 2012, which were filed late, but were filed in 2013. (Tr. p. 25.) This \noccurred a second time, most recently in 2018. \n(Tr. p. 25.)

(Tr. p. 26.) Applicant states that he \nwas late filing these returns, depending on the year, because his truck was broken into, \nhis company laptop was stolen, his personal bags were stolen, and his tax information \nincluding all W-2\u2019s were in his personal bags that were stolen, or he misplaced his \npaperwork and got busy and forgot to file. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant testified that he has now filed all of the income tax returns in question, \nnamely Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and, 2019. (Tr. p. 24.) In regard to his Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2019, they were not filed until late 2020. \nApplicant explained the reason for that delay was because he was helping his mother \nclean out the family home and moving her into a smaller home. Traveling back and \nforth took time, and he got overwhelmed. (Tr. p. 27.) In regard to his Federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2020 and 2021, Applicant states that he is working on them. (Tr. \np. 27.)  \nIn regard to his failure to file his state (B) income tax return in a timely fashion for \ntax year 2015, Applicant explained that his company sent him to work in state (B) on six \nseparate trips, for more than 28 days. His employer was not familiar with the tax laws \nthat impacted their employees temporarily working out of state. Applicant researched \nthe matter, and determined that if he was employed for more than 28 days, he and the \nother employees with him would be entitled to per diem. \nThe company payroll \ndepartment then had to change the tax withholdings for that period of time. Applicant \nwas in contact with his Human Resources department and informed them of the issue. \nIt took a while for Applicant and the others with him to receive their W-2 Forms. When \nApplicant finally received all of the documentation necessary to file his income tax return \nfor State (B), it had passed the deadline for filing. (Tr. p. 30.) Applicant has now filed \nhis 2015 income tax return for State (B). Given the extenuating circumstances here, \nthis allegation is found for the Applicant. \nApplicant testified that he has never believed in filing for an extension to file his \nreturns, and it did not make sense to him because if you have the time to do that, you \nhave time to prepare them and get them filed.  (Tr. p. 28.) \nApplicant admits that his failure to file his Federal and state (A) income tax \nreturns on time may go back as far as tax years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. \nApplicant provided copies of his Federal and State (A) income tax filings for tax \nyears 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. (Applicant\u2019s Post Hearing Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state (A) income tax returns for tax years \n2011 through 2019, in a timely fashion. Not alleged, but important to this matter is the \nfact that Applicant also failed to file his Federal and state (A) income tax returns for tax \nyears 2020 and 2021 in a timely fashion. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIt is understandable that periodically life can bring stressful situations at \nthe most inappropriate time that can distract one from their legal obligations and \nresponsibilities. However, it is not an excuse for developing a chronic pattern \nand practice of failing to file one\u2019s Federal and state (A) income tax returns as \nrequired by law. Applicant has not filed his income tax return on time for many \nyears. It appears that he waits until his security clearance update, every five \nyears, and then takes the time to catch up with his past-due income tax return \nfilings. This has happened several times over the years. Applicant conduct \nshows poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness. Accordingly, mitigating \nconditions \u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g), do not provide full mitigation in this \ncase. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant continues to drink, but he \nasserted that he is drinking more moderately, and he never drinks and drives. He \nadmitted that he still occasionally gets drunk. In March 2021, he reported that he last \nbecame intoxicated and blacked out in February 2020. (Items 2-4) \nApplicant used marijuana from about December 2015 through at least June \n2019, and cocaine from about 2013 through at least February 2019. He reported his \nalcohol issues and his marijuana and cocaine use on a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) he submitted in May 2020. He indicated for both drugs that \nhis use was \u201cOccasional use, socially. No more than once every few months.\u201d He stated \nthat he intended to use the drugs in the future with the comment: \u201cI would say there is a \npossibility of future use were the situation to arise socially.\u201d (Items 2-4) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2020. He \ndiscussed his marijuana and cocaine use. He asserted that he stopped using the drugs \nbecause he no longer had the desire to do so. He stated that he did not plan to use \nillegal drugs in the future, but he could not guarantee that he would not. He stated that \nin the right social setting, he would use both drugs in the future. (Item 4) \nApplicant responded to interrogatories in March 2021. He certified that he had \nnot used any illegal drugs since June 2019. He stated that he did not continue to \nassociate with individuals who used illegal drugs, and he did not intend to use illegal \ndrugs in the future.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and cocaine on multiple occasions over \nseveral years. He stated in his May 2020 SF 86 that he intended to use the drugs in the \nfuture. During his August 2020 background interview, he stated that he stopped using \ndrugs because he no longer had the desire to do so, and that he did not plan to use \nillegal drugs in the future. However, he also admitted that he could not guarantee that \nhe would not use drugs, and that in the right social setting, he would use marijuana and \ncocaine in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has used marijuana or cocaine since 2019. \nIn his March 2021 response to interrogatories, he certified that he had not used any \nillegal drugs since June 2019; he did not continue to associate with individuals who \nused illegal drugs; and he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He also \nadmitted, without further explanation, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, which alleged that he intends \nto use cocaine and marijuana in the future. He did not respond to the FORM, so \nadditional information is not available. It is possible that Applicant was just admitting to \nthe allegations because that was his previous belief, and he no longer intends to use \nillegal drugs. But I just do not know. Applicant has the burden to provide mitigation. He \ndid not do so. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant was cited for open container in 2014; he had a domestic incident while \ndrunk in 2015; and he was hospitalized for alcohol intoxication in 2019. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant continues to drink, but he asserted that he is drinking more moderately, \nand he never drinks and drives. He admitted that he still occasionally gets drunk. In \nMarch 2021, he reported that he last became intoxicated and blacked out in February \n2020. Applicant did not submit enough evidence to convince me that alcohol is no \nlonger a problem. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome concerns \nabout his alcohol use, reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe only criminal conduct allegation is the 2014 open container citation. That \nsingle minor offense is too remote to be a security concern. SOR \u00b6 1.a is mitigated and \nconcluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, H, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant may have his life in order after years of substance abuse or \nhe may not. I just do not know. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the Guideline J (criminal conduct) security concerns, but he did not mitigate \nthe security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 4, 5, 6) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a, \nthrough SOR 1.d. He did not provide any other explanations. \nIn his 2020 subject interview, Applicant acknowledged that all SOR debts were \nunpaid. (Item 7) The delinquent accounts appear in his 2020, and 2022 credit bureau \nreports. (Items 4, 5) He told the Government investigator that he planned to consolidate \nhis auto loans in November 2020, but provided no documentation to support his claim. \nHe wants to pay his debts and now allows his spouse to maintain the household budget. \nApplicant provided no budget, has had no financial counseling, and there is no \ninformation concerning his income or expenses. He stated that he is willing and able to \npay his delinquent debts. He offered no documents to indicate that he has taken steps to \ndo so. \nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a, 1.c, and 1.d, Applicant answered that the three alleged debts \nwere delinquent automobile loans that were charged off. (Item 7). He purchased a used \ncar in October 2018, had insufficient household income to maintain the payments, and \nallowed the bank to repossess the vehicle. As to the second delinquent auto loan, he \npurchased a used 2014 vehicle, which needed repairs that he could not afford to make. \nIn 2016, Applicant allowed the bank to repossess the vehicle. The last delinquent auto \nloan was the result of a car that he co-signed for his girlfriend in February 2014. His friend \ncould not afford the payments, and allowed the bank to repossess the car. His girlfriend \nwrecked the car in 2014. (Item 7) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant stated the medical bill of $168 was the result of an \nemergency room visit in October 2017. (Item 3). He stated that he forgot about the debt. \nThe account became delinquent in 2017. He told the investigator he was willing and able \nto repay the debt as he plans to contact the debtor. There is no evidence that he has done \nso. (Item 7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two\ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and,  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. This does not apply as the history of financial concerns date back \nto 2014.He has unresolved debts that are not paid. \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is no mitigation \ncredit available because Applicant purchased another vehicle just months \nafter the first one was repossessed. He has not provided any evidence that \nhis current financial situation is stable or reported any circumstances \nbeyond his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control. Applicant has not sought financial \ncounseling and provided no information about a budget or his financial \nstatus. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debt. Applicant failed to \ndemonstrate  that he has made any good-faith efforts to repay his creditors. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR \ndue to insufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, I find he has not \nmitigated the security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. After \nconsidering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s years of employment, I conclude that he has not \npresented sufficient evidence of mitigation under the financial considerations guideline. \nHe has not met his burden of proof. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n\u00b6 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information under the financial consideration \nguideline.

He worked for another defense contractor for almost 20 years \nbefore his current job. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1975 until he \nwas honorably discharged in 1978. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he \nhas held for about 40 years. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that he earned in 1991. He has \nnever married, but he has a long-time girlfriend. He has no children. (Tr. at 11-13, 16-\n20; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant started playing the slot machines at a local casino in about 1998. In \nabout 2009, his gambling started to become a problem. (Tr. at 23, 37-51; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1-4) He reported himself to his security office in June 2010, who \nreported the information to the DOD as follows: \nToday, 6/24/10, [Applicant] self reported a gambling problem. He has \nsought treatment through Gamblers Anonymous. [Applicant] attended his \nfirst meeting on 6/23/10. His gambling began a year ago and has resulted \nin going from no debt to approximately $100,000 debt in the form of credit \ncard, home equity and 401k loans.

He also believes he can retire his debt in 5 years and \nbe debt free again. (GE 4) \nApplicant stopped gambling for a period, and then resumed. He went through \nseveral periods of not gambling, followed by gambling. His gambling became \nproblematic again in about 2018. He lost about $200,000 in 2018. He took out money \nfrom his 401(k) retirement account and credit cards. He was unable to pay his federal \nincome taxes and other debts. (Tr. at 42-44, 48-51, 55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1-3, 5-8) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s gambling issues (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.g); $14,132 owed \nto the IRS for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and three delinquent consumer debts totaling \nabout $49,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.d). \nApplicant attributed his gambling problems to a medical condition that requires \nmedication. One of the side effects of the medication is compulsive behavior. He stated \nthat he is still on the medication, but his doctor prescribed another medication in about \n2019, which controls the compulsive behavior. (Tr. at 23-26, 59; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant reported his gambling issues on the Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86) he submitted in April 2020. He indicated that after two years of not \ngambling from about 2016 to early 2018, he stopped his counseling; the symptoms of \nhis condition became aggravated; and he increased the medication that causes \ncompulsive behavior. He relapsed from February to November 2018. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant returned to counseling, and the changes in his medication helped \ncontrol his gambling.

With this treatment plan I am not gambling nor \nfeel the urge to gamble and am recovering from my financial situation.\u201d Applicant wrote \nin his response to the SOR: \u201chad I found this treatment plan 10 years earlier I am \nconvinced I would have saved $300,000.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant started repaying his debts in 2019. He paid or settled several debts \nbefore the SOR was issued, and he made monthly payments to the SOR creditors. He \nentered into an installment agreement with the IRS in 2020. (Tr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 3, 5-8; AE A-F) \nApplicant refinanced the mortgage on his home, where he has lived since 1986, \nand he was able to pay or settle all of his debts.

He paid $14,711 and $12,155 in July 2021 to pay the \nremaining amounts owed on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He settled the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $7,560 through 11 monthly payments of $630, which he \ncompleted in February 2021. (Tr. at 27-31, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1,3, 5-\n8; AE A-E) \nApplicant\u2019s finances are currently stable. He earns a good salary; he received \nfinancial counseling; he maintains a budget; and he is paying his bills. He still has about \n$100,000 in equity in his home, and he is rebuilding his retirement account. (Tr. at 31-\n34, 57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-8; AE F-K) \nApplicant testified that he is still on the medication that \u201ctotally eliminated\u201d the \ncompulsive behavior associated with the medication prescribed for his condition. He \nattends counseling and Gamblers Anonymous. He now feels \u201c100 percent\u201d in control. \nHe estimates that he currently goes to the casino and gambles about once a month. He \nlast gambled in a casino about two weeks before the hearing, when he \u201cprobably lost \n$500.\u201d (Tr. at 24-26, 36, 44-55) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance. He is considered a valued and trusted employee.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; and \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems resulting from his gambling, \nincluding unpaid federal income taxes and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(f), \nand 19(h) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that from 2009 through 2019, Applicant \u201cengaged in significant \nfinancial transactions to fund gambling.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that in 2009 and 2010, \nApplicant \u201cincurred a total of approximately $100,000.00 in debt from funding gambling.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that in 2018 and 2019, Applicant \u201cincurred a total of approximately \n$200,000.00 in debt from funding gambling.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges all of the conduct \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. As such, they are duplicate allegations. When the same \nconduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline, at least one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant received counseling for his finances and additional counseling for his \ngambling issues. He paid his back taxes, and he paid or settled all of the SOR debts. \nHis current finances are sound. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are applicable to the back taxes \nand delinquent debts. \nThe real issue in this case is gambling, which, like alcohol, is not a problem in \nand of itself. It only becomes a problem for one\u2019s security clearance when it becomes a \nproblem in one\u2019s life. Applicant claims that gambling is no longer a problem for him. I \nwish him well, and I hope he is right, but it speaks volumes that, knowing his security \nclearance is on the line primarily because of his gambling, he went to a casino and \ngambled two weeks before the hearing. \nI have doubts that Applicant can prevent his gambling from once again becoming \na problem. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered \nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Security \nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s problematic gambling are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2021. The hearing \nwas convened on March 16, 2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 1, and 3 through 6 were \nadmitted into the record without objection. GE 2 was not admitted after Applicant \nobjected. GE 6, the Government\u2019s Discovery Letter, was marked and made part of the \nrecord, but it is not substantive evidence. Applicant Exhibits 1 through 3, were admitted \ninto the record without objection. I kept the record open until April 1, 2022, to allow him \nadditional time to supplement the record. He submitted no additional documentary \nevidence.

(Tr. 14-15) He did not adopt the interview and \nthe Government presented no authenticating witness. The objection was sustained. The \ndocument was marked and made part of the record, but it was not considered as \nsubstantive evidence. (See DOD Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 3, para. E3.1.20) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 32 years old. He graduated from high school in 2007. He attended \ncollege between August and December 2007, between January and October 2014, and \nagain from 2011 to 2021, but did not receive a degree. He stated that he completed winter \nand summer sessions in 2021. He is working on a bachelor\u2019s degree in cybersecurity \nmanagement and policy. Applicant married in May 2019, and he has two sons. (Tr. 5-7) \nApplicant\u2019s work history shows he was unemployed for seven months in 2006, and \nworked for two private companies between July 2006 and February 2008. He then \nenlisted in the Navy, where he served honorably on active duty between February 2008 \nand September 2010. Apparently, he was discharged for failure to meet physical fitness \nstandards. (Tr. 8) While in the service, he received access to classified information. His \neligibility for access to classified information was carried over into his civilian job positions. \nAfter his discharge, Applicant was unemployed between September 2010 and \nJanuary 2011. He has worked for about eight different federal contractors from January \n2011 to present. According to his 2019 SCA and testimony, except for a three-month \nperiod of unemployment between June and September 2016, he has been continuously \nemployed by federal contractors since January 2011. He was hired by his current \nemployer and clearance sponsor in March 2020. He is making about $95,000 a year. In \naddition, he has a part-time job as a bartender, making about $500 monthly. His wife is \nemployed with a state agency and makes about $40,000 yearly. \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nSeptember 3, 2019, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his \njob. In response to Section 20C (Foreign Travel), he disclosed that he and his wife \ntraveled to Jamaica for five days during their honeymoon in June 2019. \nIn his answers to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2019 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed he was \u201ccurrently working on any financial debts that I have on my own in order \nto purchase a home for my family within the next three years.\u201d He disclosed the delinquent \ncar loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (repossessed in 2018, and still owing $7,525). He disclosed \nno additional financial problems or delinquent accounts. Applicant failed to disclose the \ncharged-off car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (repossessed in 2010, and still owing $7,000); \nthe six student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.h (owing $22,371); and the five \naccounts in collection alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.m (owing $4,524).

He believes that his \nappearance at his hearing shows that he cares and that he has a clear understanding of \nhis financial shortcomings. He believes that he has been doing the things that he needs \nto do to fix his financial issues. He noted that he wants to pay off his delinquent debts, to \nmake good faith [efforts] to pay them, and to show the Government that he can be trusted. \nHe stated he is not a threat to the Government. (Tr. 17-18) \nThe status of the SOR allegations follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($7,525) concerns a car Applicant co-signed for his then girlfriend, now \nhis wife, in 2015. He testified he had some financial problems and was behind on the \npayments when the car developed engine trouble and he surrendered the car to the \ncreditor in 2018. After that, he did not make any more payments, except for one in 2018. \nHe failed to present documentary evidence to substantiate his claims of contacts with the \ncreditor or of any payments made. \nAfter his hearing, in March 2022, Applicant contacted the creditor and settled the \ndebt for $4,130. He promised to make 12 monthly payments of about $344 to pay off the \ndebt. He presented no documentary evidence of any payments made. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($7,000) alleges a charged-off car loan. Applicant purchased the car \nwhen he was in the Navy in 2009. After he was administratively discharged for failure to \nmeet fitness standards in 2010, he was unemployed for about five months, could not \nmake the car payments, and the car was repossessed. He presented no documentary \nevidence of any contacts with the creditor or of any payments made since 2010. He \nbelieves he is no longer financially responsible for the debt because it was dropped from \nhis credit report. This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.h alleged six student loans in collection, totaling $22,371. \nApplicant claimed he had been in contact with the Department of Education (DOE) to \nhave the loans deferred because he was attending college, but decided to establish a \nmonthly payment arrangement. He presented no documentary evidence of his contacts \nwith the DOE, or of any payment arrangements made. \nI note that Applicant\u2019s student loans are currently in forbearance. In April 2022, the \nDOE extended the student loan payment pause through August 31, 2022. The pause \nincludes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments, \na 0% interest rate, and stopped collections on defaulted loans. The Federal Student Aid \nbegan accepting and reviewing applications from borrowers seeking loan forgiveness \nunder the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program in the fall of 2017. Applicant \npresented no evidence to show that he had applied for student loan forgiveness; however, \nbecause of the forbearance, I find the student loans allegations for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,502) alleges a delinquent lease in collection. Applicant explained he \nbroke the lease to move to a more affordable apartment. He claimed he subsequently \nsettled and paid the delinquent account. He presented no documentary evidence of any \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \ncontacts with the creditor, of any payments made toward this debt after he broke the \nlease, or of other efforts to resolve the debt.

He \npresented no documentary evidence of any contacts with the creditors, of any payments \nmade toward these debts, or of other efforts to resolve the debts. (Tr. 26-28) I allowed \nhim additional time after his hearing to supplement the record with documentary evidence \nto corroborate his claims. He failed to submit any additional documentary evidence. (Tr. \n27-28) \nApplicant presented no evidence to show that circumstances beyond his control \nprevented him from addressing his SOR debts. I considered that he was unemployed \nseven months in 2006, five months in 2010-2011, and three months in 2016. He failed to \nexplain how these periods of unemployment or underemployment adversely affected his \nability to pay his financial obligations. After he was hired by his current employer in 2020, \nApplicant has been making around $95,000 a year.  \nApplicant believes he has done his best to reestablish himself financially and to \npay off his delinquent debts. He believes that his financial situation is good. Except for \nthe delinquent SOR debts, he is current in his recent financial obligations. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of any contacts with creditors, of \nany settlements made, of payment agreements established, or of any payments made \nbefore or after the SOR was issued, except for the settlement with the account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He presented no evidence showing that he has participated in any recent \nfinancial counseling. He claimed he is following a budget, but presented no documentary \nevidence of his working budget. \nApplicant stated that he understands what he needs to do to get his financial \nproblems corrected and to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant expressed his \ndesire to resolve his financial problems. He now understands the seriousness of having \nnegative information on his credit. He promised to resolve the remaining delinquent debts \nin the near future. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history includes two charged-off car loans after repossession, \nsix student loans in collection, and five delinquent consumer accounts. After his hearing, \nApplicant negotiated a settlement and payment agreement with the creditor of the account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He presented no evidence of any payments made pursuant to the \nsettlement agreement. He claimed he paid the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through \n1.m, but failed to submit evidence to corroborate his claims. The record establishes the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable because Applicant has unresolved ongoing debts that \nhave been delinquent for many years. Applicant did not claim circumstances beyond his \ncontrol prevented him from addressing his delinquent debts. I considered his periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. His unemployment in 2010-2011 resulted from his \ndischarge from the Navy for his failure to meet physical fitness standards. He had control \nover his physical fitness and I cannot consider his discharge a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. While I could accept that Applicant\u2019s financial problems may have been \naggravated by circumstances beyond his control, his evidence is insufficient to show that \nhe was financially responsible under his circumstances. \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since at least 2011. He has \nbeen earning about $95,000 a year since 2020, with an additional $500 a month from a \npart-time job, and his wife is making $40,000 a year. Applicant presented little \ndocumentary evidence of efforts to contact his creditors, of payments made, settlements \nagreements, or payment plans established before or after he received the SOR in May \n2021. Only SOR \u00b6 1.a was settled after the SOR was issued. Applicant claimed he paid \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($584), 1.k ($500), 1.l ($207), and 1.m ($1,731). He presented no \ndocumentary evidence of any contacts with the creditors, of any payments made toward \nthese debts, or of other efforts to resolve the debts. \nApplicant received credit for his recent efforts to pay or resolve his delinquent \ndebts after receipt of the SOR. Notwithstanding, I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis evidence is insufficient to explain why he was unable to address his delinquent \naccounts more diligently. Six of the SOR accounts remain unresolved and have been \ndelinquent for many years. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, 32, received credit for his service in the Navy. He has been working for \nfederal contractors since at least 2011, while possessing eligibility for a clearance. He \nstarted the process to pay or resolve his delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR after \nreceipt of the SOR. He has made a good start to establish his future financial \nresponsibility. Notwithstanding, financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. He should have been more diligent addressing and resolving his \ndelinquent accounts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \ndid not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make \ngreater documented progress sooner to resolve the SOR debts. He did not provide \npersuasive documentary evidence showing he made specific and reasonable offers to \nsettle the SOR debts. His lack of documented responsible financial action in regard to \nthese SOR debts for the last 10 years raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Five are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest; and \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a dual national citizen of Finland. He is an Honorary Consul for \nFinland. Applicant has substantial financial interests in Finland, which he shares with his \nchildren and with his Finnish co-habitant. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant has strong connections to Finland: dual-citizenship, a Finnish \nGovernment appointed consulate position, a Finnish co-habitant, and co-ownership of \nabout $1,000,000 in Finnish bank accounts, business interests, and property interests. \nForeign Influence is found against Applicant. \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests;\n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Finland. He exercised his \nFinnish citizenship by voting in a recent Finland Presidential election. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are described \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Five are potentially applicable: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign citizenship \nthat is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen; and \n(e) the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not \npresent a national security concern. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Applicant, through his Finnish \nConsulship; and participation in Finland\u2019s 2018 Presidential election, has shown a \nForeign Preference. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in his workplace and in his community. However, overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.d~1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j~1.k: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of facts. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He graduated from high school in 2007. He served in the \nmilitary from 2009 to 2017. He deployed to the Persian Gulf in 2010 and was part of \ncombat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged in the rank of \nE-5. He married in 2012 and has a 10-year-old child. He began work with a federal \ncontractor in July 2020, earning a salary of $92,000. Before then, he worked as a nurse\u2019s \naide from August 2019 to July 2020 with an annual salary of $26,000. From August 2017 \nto August 2019, he worked for the Postal Service and attended college. His annual salary \nwas about $40,000. (Tr. 16-20, 60-61) \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and attributed his financial problems to a \nperiod when he was underemployed after his discharge from the military. He and his wife \npurchased a home in 2013 that was affordable on his salary. His wife was not working at \nthe time. In 2014, his wife got a job and was earning about $13 an hour. In late 2014, she \nbecame a manager at a retail store and was friends with the owner. Her income increased \nto almost $1,000 a week. She had a disagreement with the owner, and lost her job in \n2016. Applicant testified that when her salary increased, they made poor financial \ndecisions and lived beyond their means. His wife then got a job with a credit union at a \nsubstantially reduced salary, and his son went to daycare. His son has respiratory issues \nand was frequently sick, which required his wife to miss work, until she finally had to \nresign due to their son\u2019s health. They began to fall behind in paying their debts. (Tr. 21-\n26, 62-63) \nApplicant testified that they could not afford the car payments on the two vehicles \nthey had purchased, so he returned them and purchased two older vehicles. He said he \nshould have considered bankruptcy at the time, but because of pride and stupidity, he did \nnot. (Tr. 25, 31) \nIn 2017, after he was discharged from the military, Applicant and his family moved \nback to his home state. He completed a deed in lieu of foreclosure on his house in May \n2017.

During this time, he had difficulty paying his\ndebts due to low wages. (Tr. 18-19, 25-27) \n \nApplicant testified that through his research he believed much of his debt would be \nbarred by the statute of limitations. He later learned that his financial issues were a \nsecurity concern, and he realized he needed to address his delinquencies. He \nacknowledged that when he was interviewed by a government investigator in August \n2020, he told the investigator that he was willing and able to pay each debt. He testified \nthat at that time he was willing to pay the debts, but he did not understand the full \nramification of his failure to act expeditiously. He credibly testified that he did not fully \ngrasp the importance of resolving his delinquent debt until his security clearance became \nan issue. (Tr. 28, 59-62) \nApplicant further testified that when his wife had to resign from her job due to his \nson\u2019s health issues, his underemployment severely impacted their ability to pay their \ndebts. She is now working full time, and they are able to meet their monthly expenses. At \nthe time, he considered letting the statute of limitations run on his debts so he could be in \na better financial situation. (Tr. 17) \nApplicant testified that he used his tax refund to pay his student loans, but did not \nbegin to address his other delinquent debts until after he received the SOR in June 2021. \nHe withdrew funds from his military Thrift Savings Plan to pay some of the debts. (Tr. 30\u00ad\n31) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($12,988), 1.b ($10,467), and 1.c ($7,630) are all to the \nsame creditor and includes a repossessed vehicle. Applicant took out a loan for \napproximately $9,000 and used it to settle the above debts in November 2021. He settled \nthem for $3,000, $2,800, and $2,000 respectively. His monthly loan payment is $339 and \nhe is current on his payments. He provided IRS Form 1099-C (cancellation of debt) for \nthe balances canceled in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 32-49; GE \n3, 4; AE A, C, H) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($5,171) is a credit card that Applicant had difficulty paying \nafter his wife lost her job in 2016. He began paying $200 a month on it in August 2021 \nand then settled it for $1,953 in June 2022. He testified he used money he had saved to \nsettle the debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 49-51; GE 3, 4; AE A) \nApplicant testified that the money he withdrew from his current 401K pension plan \nwas used to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($889), 1.f ($870), 1.g ($592) and 1.h ($450). \nHe provided supporting documents. (Tr. 51-57; GE 3, 4; AE A, B, D, I) \nApplicant believed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($3,808) was a debt consolidation loan \nand he has not yet reached a settlement to resolve the debt. It was reported on his July \n2020 and May 2021 credit reports, but not on his September 2022 credit report. He \nintends to resolve it.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2016 that he was unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to a period of underemployment and his \nson\u2019s medical issues that resulted in his wife having to quit her job. These conditions were \nbeyond his control. He also testified that for a period of time when his wife was earning a \nsignificant salary they lived beyond their means, which was within his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. This mitigating condition has limited application because Applicant did not \nbegin to address his delinquent debts until after he received the SOR. \nWhen Applicant fully grasped the security clearance significance of his failure to \npay his delinquent debts, he began to diligently resolve them. He made good-faith efforts \nto pay and settle all of his debt. He provided documents to support his efforts. He has one \nremaining debt that he intends to resolve, but has not yet reached a settlement with the \ncreditor. There are clear indications that his financial issues are being resolved and under \ncontrol. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be honest and forthcoming. He readily admitted \nhe made some poor financial choices and was looking for options in resolving them. His \nunderemployment and son\u2019s health issues which impacted his wife\u2019s employment were \ndetrimental to his financial stability, but so were some of his poor choices. I believe he \nhas learned a valuable lesson and do not believe he will have future financial issues. He \nhas resolved all but one debt, but I believe he is committed to resolving it. AG \u00b6 20(a) and \n20(c) have some applicability. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debts he has resolved. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.)  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant has established a track record of paying his debts. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts. He resolved all but one.

The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 10, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing on September 23, 2021.

The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AppXs) A through D, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 7, \n2021. The record closed on November 30, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since 1989. He has held a security clearance \nsince about 1985. He is married, and has two children. (TR at page 12 line 1 to page 13 \nline 16.) \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n2.a. Applicant used marijuana, about once or twice a month, from about January \nof 2007 until December of 2009, while granted access to classified information. (TR at \npage 13 line 20 to page 14 line 25.) \n2.b. Applicant used cocaine, on two occasions, during the period from about \nJanuary of 2007 until December of 2009, while granted access to classified information. \n(TR at page 15 lines 1~14.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.b. Applicant falsified his November 2011 SF-86, in answer to Section 23, by \nfailing to disclose his drug involvement, noted above. (TR at page 22 line 24 to page 24\nline 12, and GX 1 at page 22.) I find this falsification to be willful. \n \n1.a. Applicant falsified his May 2020 SF-86, in answer to Section 23, by failing to \ndisclose his cocaine involvement, noted above. (TR at page 22 line 24 to page 23 line\n19, at page 24 line 17 to page 25 line 14, and GX 1 at page 22.) I find this falsification to\nbe willful. \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana and cocaine. He had a security clearance for his job at \nthat time. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement was more than a decade ago. He has submitted a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. \n(AppX B.) The Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse guideline is found for \nApplicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified two security clearance applications: in 2011 and again in 2020. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \nApplicant\u2019s willful falsifications cover a decade. He made no prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct this personal misconduct on either occasion. Personal Conduct is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is \nrespected in the workplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs C and D.) However, \noverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has taken some college courses, but does not have \na degree. He served in the Army from 1987 until he retired in 2017 in the rank of E-6. He \nwas married from 1990 to 1993 and has no children from the marriage. He remarried in \n1999, and he has three grown stepchildren ages 35, 33, and 30. After his military \nretirement, Applicant obtained a job with a federal contractor and has been employed \nsteadily. His wife worked in the past, but is no longer employed. (Tr. 15-20) \nIn 2004, while deployed to Iraq, Applicant was wounded and was diagnosed with \na traumatic brain injury (TBI). He testified that his injury has impacted his memory.

It appears his security \nclearance was revoked, and he sent a letter to the DOD Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) dated August 22, 2013, with a subject line: Request for Reconsideration-\nRevocation of Security Clearance.

(GE 10) \nApplicant\u2019s command was directed to monitor his efforts to resolve his delinquent \ndebts every three months for one year, and Applicant was to provide documentation of \nhis efforts to pay his delinquent debts and student loans. (GE 10) \nApplicant testified that when he returned from deployment in 2016 (his 2014 \ndeployment extended into 2016), he realized he was on the \u201chook\u201d for the student loans, \nand he would have to pay them.

(Tr. 23-31, 53) \nIn June 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ndisclosed to the investigator that he had cosigned the student loans for his stepdaughter \nand was unaware until about 2019, when he went to obtain a mortgage, that she was not \nmaking payments, and he would be responsible for paying this debt. He told the \ninvestigator he did not disclose the delinquent student loans on his security clearance \napplication (SCA) because he was trying to get his stepdaughter to pay them. He said he \nthought she was paying the student loans when he completed the SCA. He stated that \nafter he learned she was not, he realized he had to take an active role to fix his finances.1 \n(Tr. 21, 53-61; GE 2) \nApplicant spoke to his stepdaughter in the summer of 2021 about her paying the \nstudent loans and she told him she could not pay them and had no interest in paying \nthem. He said he contacted the Department of Education in January 2022, and applied \nfor the loans to be forgiven. He believed he may have been eligible to have the student \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes, but may be considered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nloans forgiven due to his disability.

(GE 2-8) \nApplicant testified that when he was in the Army he was totally focused on the \nmission and training soldiers. He was not educated about finances while in the Army. He \nrealized when he retired that his finances needed to be addressed, and he needed to \nimprove his credit score. He testified that he is now aware of the issues and will take \naction and make payments. Applicant attributed some of his failure to address the student \nloans to his memory issues. (Tr. 20-21, 31, 33, 72) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is responsible for approximately $84,000 of delinquent student loans that \nwere obtained in approximately 2006. He has been aware of his obligation since at least \n2013 and has taken minimal action to resolve this debt. He also had some other accounts \nthat were delinquent. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant resolved the delinquent accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.d. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies to them. He has not resolved the largest debt owed for the delinquent student \nloans. He cosigned the student loans for his stepdaughter. He has been aware of their \ndelinquency since at least 2013 and his responsibility to pay them. He was put on notice \nduring his security clearance adjudication in 2013 that they were a security concern and \nhe made a few payments. Although he says he believed his stepdaughter was repaying \nthe loans, he provided no evidence that payments were made by her or that he followed \nup on ensuring such payments were being made. He testified that he was again made \naware they were not being paid in 2019. He failed to take action on them at that time or \nafter he was interviewed by a government investigator in 2020. He provided a letter from \nthe DOE from March 2022 regarding his request to have the loans forgiven. He did not \nprovide evidence that he qualified for forgiveness of the loans or that he has arranged a \npayment plan. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans have not been paid and are recent. There is insufficient \nevidence that his financial problems were beyond his control. He has not provided \nevidence he has participated in financial counseling or that there are clear indications the \nproblem is being resolved. There is no evidence that he has initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to repay his student loans and minimal evidence that he is resolving the \ndebt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply to the student loans. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered that Applicant is a veteran who was injured in combat. Although, \nperhaps some of the delay in addressing the student loans could be attributed to memory \nissues, he has been on notice several times over the last ten years that these student \nloans were a security concern. He has also been aware that his stepdaughter does not \nintend to pay them and he is responsible to do so. At this juncture, he has failed to provide \nevidence that he is making arrangements to pay the student loans or has a plan for \nresolving them. He has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under financial considerations (Guideline F) that Applicant owes $32,547 in delinquent debts to six creditors or collection agencies. The listed 2 debts are for a credit card, two installment car loans, a personal loan, and a dental debt. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted some debts and denied others, with explanations. The SOR also alleges personal conduct (Guideline E) based on Applicant\u2019s arrest in September 2014 and plea of guilty to the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. (SOR 2.a) SOR 2.b alleges Applicant falsified Section 22 of his February 2020 e-QIP by not disclosing his arrest and charge identified in SOR 2.a. He denied both allegations, contending that he was neither arrested nor found with any paraphernalia in his possession. Applicant contends that he was unaware of what was found. He remembered the officer writing him a ticket. The officer then instructed him to pay the ticket as soon as he could. At the hearing, he recalled the officer writing him two tickets. (Tr. 74) He was then free to go. Applicant denied SOR 2.b as he did not remember the incident, specifically his arrest, when he signed and certified the April 2020 e-QIP.

A good-faith and meaningful \ntrack record of payments is lacking. Conversely, he has mitigated the security concerns \nbrought under the guideline for personal conduct. Eligibility for security clearance \naccess is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 20,2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD), Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) which could not make the affirmative \nfindings required to grant Applicant a security clearance, issued him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), dated July 12, 2017, detailing security concerns raised by financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n        \n \n      \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n  \n        \n \n \n \n       \n \n      \n \n        \n \n    \n \n        \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n    \n \n      \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs).

The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 21, 2022 for a \nhearing on February 18, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled.

On February 26, 2021, Applicant was not represented by counsel \nwhen he submitted his answer to the SOR, with attached exhibits. Because Applicant \nwas unrepresented when he submitted his answer, all of Applicant\u2019s pre-hearing and \npost-hearing exhibits have been modified, reorganized, and remarked to ensure all \nexhibits are entered into evidence.

(SOR 2.a) SOR 2.b alleges Applicant falsified Section 22 of his February \n2020 e-QIP by not disclosing his arrest and charge identified in SOR 2.a. He denied \nboth allegations, contending that he was neither arrested nor found with any \nparaphernalia in his possession. Applicant contends that he was unaware of what was \nfound. He remembered the officer writing him a ticket. The officer then instructed him to \npay the ticket as soon as he could. At the hearing, he recalled the officer writing him two \ntickets. (Tr. 74) He was then free to go. \nApplicant denied SOR 2.b as he did not remember the incident, specifically his \narrest, when he signed and certified the April 2020 e-QIP. He was 39 years old when he \nfilled out the e-QIP. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He has two sons, 18 and 20 years old; he has a \nstepson 21 years old, and a stepdaughter 16 years old. He plans to marry in June 2022. \nHe has been employed by a contractor in information technology (IT) since April 2017. \nBefore his current job, he worked at a call center for three months. From November \n2016 to February 2017, he was unemployed. In addition, he was unemployed from July \n2009 to July 2010. His employment history includes 16 years as a general service \nspecialist. He has never had any problems with his security clearance that he has held \nsince 2007. He participates in regular security briefings on the different aspects of \nsafeguarding classified information. (GE 1 at 12-20, 35; Tr. 14-20) \nApplicant advocates his children\u2019s participation in activities that increases their \nperspectives and viewpoints on the world around them. He took them on a vacation to a \ncountry in the Caribbean in 2011, and a Latin American country in 2017 for six to 10 \ndays. He also took the entire family to another country in the Caribbean in 2018 or \n2019. He recalled spending about $1,500 on that trip. (GE 1 at 29-30, 48-50) \nSOR 1.a \u2013 In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the debt and \nprovided documentation showing the judgment, filed in February 2017, was satisfied in \nApril 2021, after he received the SOR. The account was opened in April 2016 and \nbecame delinquent in September 2016. Applicant filed an identity theft complaint with \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because he surmised that someone had used the \ncard fraudulently. Applicant did not resolve the debt sooner because he did not know \nabout it. He neglected to address the debt. (GE 2 at 2; GE 4 at 13; GE 5; Tr. 21; 48-53; \nAE A; AE C) \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This is an installment car loan that Applicant admitted.

This type of insurance \nhelps pay when the auto loan is more that the depreciated value of the vehicle. Though \nApplicant used words in his testimony that he was fighting the debt, I find he was really \ntrying to negotiate with \u2018Silver Rock\u2019 GAP insurance company on the amount he would \nhave to pay under the policy. Applicant testified that he had a formal payment \nagreement with the creditor that began in February 2021. He believed that he could \nprovide documentation of the agreement. No independent proof was provided. His \nintentions of paying consistently under the agreement were thwarted by his marital \nplans and other obligations. He claimed he had been making payments on the account \nuntil just before the Christmas holidays of 2021, but supplied documentary proof of one \n$154 payment in February 2021. After the hearing, Applicant provided an undated \nstatement indicating that the account was closed on April 30, 2019, with a zero balance. \nThe unanswered question is how the charged off account got resolved with a zero \nbalance on April 30, 2019. (GE 4 at 9; Tr. 22-23, 53-59; AE B, M) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This account was for a line of credit that was opened in December \n2015 and became delinquent in April 2016. Applicant denied he opened this account. \nHe reported this debt to the IRS claiming identity theft. Tax refunds were somehow used \nto pay for items on his credit report that he did not recognize. No additional information \nwas provided concerning his identity theft claim. In February 2022, Applicant disputed \nthis account with a credit service, but testified he was still making payments on the debt. \nHe supplied undated paperwork indicating the disputed account was closed on July 1, \n2016 with a zero balance. (AE M, N) The unanswered question is how did the account \nclose July 2016, with a zero balance, but he was still making payments on the account \nin 2021. (GE 4 at 11; Tr. 23-24, 59-60) \nSOR 1.d \u2013 This is an installment car loan that was opened in June 2014 and \nbecame delinquent in February 2016. Applicant\u2019s documentation shows the account \nwas closed on June 1, 2016. The collection agency actually sold this account to the \nSOR 1.e creditor. (GE 4 at 13; Tr. 24, 61; AE M) \nSOR 1.e \u2013 This is an installment car loan account that opened in January 2016 \nand became delinquent in October 2017. Applicant admitted owing this creditor. He filed \na dispute when the creditor refused to fix the car even though it was under warranty. \nWhen Applicant fixed the car with his own money, the car developed more mechanical \nproblems. Applicant called the creditor to repossess the car because he was sold a \nlemon. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement with the SOR 1.e creditor in \nFebruary 2021. The terms were payments of $100 a month. Applicant missed payments \nfor four or five months. The February 22, 2021 payment agreement called for a $200 \ndown payment, seven subsequent payments, with a final payment of $12,997. He tried \ntwo years ago and last year to dispute the debt.

(GE 4 at 9; Tr. 61-63; AE D, O) \nSOR 1.f \u2013 This is an account for dental services received in March 2015. The \naccount became delinquent in March 2020. Applicant recalled his dentist did some work \nbut did not finish the job because there was a problem with Applicant\u2019s insurance. He \nhad to go to another dentist to get the dental work completed. Applicant was told that he \ncould have this debt removed by applying the statute of limitations. He also paid about \n$500 or $600 on the debt in the summer of 2021. His documentation shows that he \nmade only a $106 payment to this creditor on February 25, 2021. Also in February \n2021, he was advised by letter that this creditor could no longer sue him because of the \nage of the debt. On February 18, 2021, Applicant then consented on a recorded line to \npay this creditor by regular electronic payments. (GE 4 at 11; Tr. 63-66; AE E, P) \nWhen Applicant was unemployed in 2009 and 2016, he relied on his \nunemployment compensation and his mother to pay his bills. Some bills were not paid \nregularly. Other than the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant has incurred no new debt. \nHe always pays his taxes. He never had legal problems because of not paying debts. \nApplicant believes he listed all his debts that he was aware of on his e-QIP. The only \ntime he has had financial problems is when he is not working. Even with employment \nissues, he has always been trustworthy and would not betray the country. (Tr. 27-33) \nSOR 2.a \u2013 Applicant denied this allegation because he was never arrested. The \nparaphernalia found in the car he owned and was driving did not belong to him. The \noffense was expunged. Even though he received a ticket, the officer had no probable \ncause to stop him. Besides receiving a ticket for the paraphernalia charge, Applicant \nreceived a ticket for having something wrong with his car. He was instructed to pay the \nticket as soon as possible and then was free to go. The offense was not in the forefront \nof his mind because it happened many times before in the area he grew up. That was \nwhy he answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions alleged in SOR 2.b. I find that he forgot about \nthe offense when he filled out the e-QIP in February 2020. (Tr. 34-36, 70-75) \nApplicant testified that he talked to a credit union adviser and a financial \ncounselor, and will continue to talk with them because he does not want to proceed with \nthe marriage with ongoing financial problems. In a letter dated February 26, 2022, a \nminister since 1999, with expertise in premarital spiritual guidance, initially talked with \nApplicant in November 2020 about spiritual guidance in planning for matrimony. In her \nworkbook material, she stresses the importance of sound financial management in all \nmoney matters, including establishing a budget and monitoring expenses on a regular \nbasis.

The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAn applicant seeking access to classified information must demonstrate that he \nhas good judgment to comply with all security regulations at all times and in all places. \nObviously, responsibly managing one\u2019s personal life by paying debts in a timely fashion \nis an important component of good judgment. Generally, an individual\u2019s personal debts \nare not a government concern unless an investigation reveals that the debts have \nbecome delinquent because they are not being paid. The adverse information in credit \nbureau reports can meet the substantial evidence standard to establish controverted \nfacts under the financial considerations guideline. See ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) Then, the burden shifts to applicant to rebut or show that \nmitigation applies to ultimately find in his favor. The timing of an applicant\u2019s payment of \nhis debts is an important factor in his case for mitigation. An applicant who initiates \naction toward resolution of financial problems only after being placed on notice that his \nclearance is in jeopardy may not have the judgment to comply with security regulations \nat all times, even when his personal interest is not put at risk. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26,2017)  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts invoke the application of the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b619: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe listed debts became delinquent between September 2016 and March 2020. \nAG \u00b620 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve issue. \nThough the SOR-listed accounts became delinquent between five and seven \nyears ago, these six debts materialized under circumstances that could recur. The \ndelinquencies and Applicant\u2019s conflicting and confusing explanations about their status \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) applies minimally. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from July 2009 to July 2010 warrants significant \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) for managing without a job for a year. However, he has had \nuninterrupted employment for the next eleven years except for a three-month period \nbetween November 2016 and February 2017. \nApplicant has made several claims about SOR 1.b. One claim is that he was \nwaiting on the outcome of negotiations for his 2022 payment of a portion of the SOR 1.b \naccount through GAP insurance. That claim deviates from his undated documentation \nthat shows the account was actually closed two years earlier in July 2019, with a zero \nbalance. Both of those claims cannot be reconciled with his testimonial position that he \nwas still making payments on the account until just before the Christmas holidays in \n2021, though he produced only one documented payment dated February 2021. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.c, if Applicant was still paying on the delinquent account in \n2021, he failed to explain how the account was actually closed in July 2016, with a zero \nbalance. While he agreed to a payment plan with the SOR 1.e creditor in February 2021 \nhe provided no proof of payments under the agreement. Furthermore, an investigation \nby one of the three major credit unions determined that the debt was accurate. In \nFebruary 2021, the SOR 1.f creditor advised Applicant that they could no longer sue \nbecause of the expiration of the statute of limitations. Yet, Applicant voiced his \nagreement over a recorded telephone line to a payment plan. No evidence of payments \nwas presented. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, Applicant has decided to rely on the \nstatute of limitations to resolve these debts instead of making a good-faith effort to pay \nthe debts. He even admitted that objective when testifying about SOR \u00b6 1.f. In the four \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlisted cases above, he seriously undermined his credibility by then providing misleading \ntestimonial statements that he had continued to make payments, when in reality, no \npayments were made after February 2021. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, \nhowever, the second prong of the condition (acting reasonably under the \ncircumstances) receives negligible attention. \nAlthough Applicant testified that he was in discussions with a financial \ncounselor of a credit union, there is little information explaining what action he took as a \nresult of these discussions. Applicant\u2019s minister and spiritual advisor provided an \nimpressive overview of her financial course. However, there is no indication of whether \nApplicant participated in the course. There is no meaningful evidence that Applicant\u2019s \ndebts, except for SOR 1.a are being resolved or under control.  \nApplicant\u2019s payment of the SOR 1.a judgment in April 2021 merits slight \nmitigation even though he paid the judgment two months after he received the SOR. He \nreceives no mitigation for his inaction toward the remaining four creditors because \nwaiting for the limitations statute to run does not constitute a good-faith way of resolving \ndelinquent debts under security clearance law. The limited mitigation due under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is based on Applicant\u2019s payment of the SOR 1.a judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) has not been established because Applicant has not presented \nsufficient evidence to show a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebts. The creditors\u2019 charge off of the accounts or the fact that the debts no longer \nappear in credit reports does not mean that they have been satisfactorily resolved. See \nISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov.13, 2015) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concerns under the personal conduct guideline in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information \nAG \u00b6 17. A condition that may mitigate the security concerns is: \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his hearing testimony, his \nrecollection of events reveal that he was stopped by the police in in September 2014. \nThe possession of paraphernalia charge was probably a misdemeanor due to Applicant \nreceiving a deferred judgment for the offense. This type of sentence is usually imposed \nin misdemeanor cases representing the person\u2019s first offense. Having weighed all of \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his denial of the offense, specifically the passage of more \nthan five years, and the lack of substantiation of an arrest, I find for Applicant under \nSOR 2.a and 2.b. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, has noted under the financial considerations \nguideline that an applicant should demonstrate a good-faith and \u201cmeaningful track \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nrecord\u201d of payments that shows overall debt reduction. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at \n2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) While an applicant is not required to be free of all debt, he \nshould demonstrate he has a plan and is dedicating unequivocal action to implement \nthe plan. Waiting for the statute of limitations to expire so the debts are legally \nunenforceable would be a legal course of action, but it is not considered a good-faith \ncourse of action to resolve debts under AG \u00b6 20(d). Considering the evidence as a \nwhole, the lack of a track record of payments on the delinquent accounts renders \nApplicant\u2019s sparse evidence in mitigation insufficient to overcome the ongoing security \nconcerns that emanate from the guideline for financial considerations. Applicant has \nmitigated the personal conduct guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

These documents \nalso show that he made sporadic, additional payments to the IRS in October 2020, \nFebruary 2021, and two payments in April 2021. \nThe documents he submitted with his response to the SOR reflect that, as of \nDecember 2021, he paid $7,525 toward his delinquent taxes for the aforementioned tax \nyears, as well as for the 2021 tax year. In exhibits attached to his FORM response, he \nprovided a document that shows that he has made five additional $300 monthly \npayments through May 2022, and an additional payment of $1,301 in June 2022. The \ntotal amount of payments that Applicant made to the IRS reflected in these documents \nis about $10,300. Applicant acknowledged owing about $40,000 in back taxes in June \n2022. The SOR allegations are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions, his \nevidence, and the Government\u2019s evidence. (Items 2-9, 11; the June 2022 letter; AE 1, 4-\n8, 10-13) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMarch 2017. The SF 86 required information about Applicant\u2019s taxes. He had an \ninterview with a Department of Defense (DOD) investigator in December 2018 in which \nhis tax problems were discussed. Applicant also was required to provide documents \nand information related to his taxes to the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF). He provided these documents and information in a response in November 2020 \nand five supplemental responses between March 2021 and July 2021. Each such \nresponse provided evidence of incremental progress of Applicant\u2019s attempts to file his \nlate federal tax returns and to pay his delinquent federal taxes. (Items 3, 4-9, 11) \nAs evidenced by documents Applicant submitted in his response to the FORM, \nthe IRS acknowledged receiving his 2019, 2018, and 2016 tax returns in October 2020. \nIt acknowledged receiving his 2017 tax return in December 2020, and his 2015 tax \nreturn in November 2020. It acknowledged receiving his 2014 tax return in September \n2021, and his 2013 tax return in May 2022. He claimed that he submitted his 2013 \nfederal tax return in November 2020, but the IRS did not process this return until May \n2022. However, in one of his supplemental interrogatory responses, he also claimed to \nhave submitted his 2013 federal tax return in February 2021, so his claims are \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninconsistent. Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Applicant filed any of \nthe late federal tax returns or paid any of the delinquent taxes listed in the SOR for over \na year-and-a-half after he submitted his SF 86 and had his security interview. There is \nno evidence that the IRS granted Applicant a filing extension for any of the tax years \nrelevant to the SOR. The IRS acknowledged receiving his 2020 federal tax return in \nJune 2021, with no outstanding taxes being owed for that tax year. (Items 2, 4-9; the \nJune 2022 letter; AE 3-11) \nApplicant claimed that he was unaware that his federal tax returns were not \nbeing filed because he was traveling for work. He acknowledged that he was not staying \non top of his finances because of this travel. He claimed that the outstanding taxes \nresulted from his wife\u2019s social security income. When he realized he had several years \nof unfiled tax returns, he did not think that he had the money to pay the taxes that would \nbe due, so he did not remedy these filing failures. He claimed that he did not have the \nmoney to pay his taxes because his wife was unemployed, he was underemployed, and \nthey had expenses related to the care of his children, his parents, and his in-laws. He \nalso blames staffing shortcomings at the IRS and the pandemic for not allowing him to \nremedy his late tax return filings as early as he claims he could have. (Items 3, 11; the \nJune 2022 letter) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He did not file his 2013 through \n2019 federal income tax returns when they were due, and he has unpaid federal taxes. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has suffered from issues such as underemployment, his wife\u2019s \nunemployment, and caring for aging parents and in-laws. However, none of these \nissues can reasonably excuse his failure to comply with his tax filing obligations. \nLikewise, these issues did not cause him to fail to withhold a sufficient portion of income \nto meet his tax burden. Moreover, Applicant acknowledged that he was not adequately \nmonitoring his financial obligations. A degree of ignorance to one\u2019s financial situation \nmay suggest an indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal obligations that draws \ninto question Applicant\u2019s willingness or capacity to comply with the sometimes complex \nrules governing the handling and safeguarding of classified information. ISCR Case No. \n18-02914 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2020). Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s tax filing and payment \ndelinquencies were not due to circumstances beyond his control. \nWhile Applicant has remedied his late tax return filings and has been complying \nwith a payment arrangement to pay his delinquent taxes, he began these efforts after \nbeing put on notice that his failure on these fronts might interfere with his ability to hold \na position of public trust. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after \nhaving been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). The timing of these efforts undermines any claims that he was acting in good \nfaith or acting responsibly under the circumstances. \nThere is evidence that Applicant timely filed and paid his 2020 federal tax \nreturns. However, this single year of timeliness is insufficient to show reform and \nrehabilitation or a track record of voluntary compliance. Applicant\u2019s failures to comply \nwith his federal tax obligations continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the trustworthiness concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns and delinquent taxes are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had a plethora of past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAlthough Applicant has addressed much of his past-due indebtedness, his \nfinancial problems are ongoing. Applicant still has nearly $12,000 of past-due \nindebtedness. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) has not been established. Financial Considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i~1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.n~1.x: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He stated the confrontation continued out of the \nvehicle, and he cut the seller twice, and left. He asserted that he used the knife to \ndefend himself. He was eventually arrested by police and charged with felony malicious \nwounding. He served three years in juvenile prison, and had three years of probation. \nHe stated that he matured a lot while serving his sentence, and understands that he \nused very poor judgement in that circumstance. He asserted that his drug habit and \nyouth were contributing factors to the incident. (Tr. 48-51, 73-83; GE 1, 2) \nWhile serving his sentence, Applicant completed his GED, and was selected to \ntake some college level courses. He also was chosen to participate in a work-release \nprogram, where he worked three different jobs during the week, and returned to the \ndetention facility at night. After he was released, he started attending community \ncollege. He had a high GPA at community college, and once he received his associate\u2019s \ndegree, he was able to transfer into a regular four-year university. He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in 2018. He asserted that he has learned from \nhis mistakes, and now only associates with mature people who are role models for him. \nApplicant stated that he has learned from his two alcohol-related arrests in 2019, and \nhas modified his alcohol consumption. He has a close relationship with family members \nwho act as his support system. He stated that he is committed to serving in a positon \nthat serves the interests of national defense, and is willing and able to meet the high \nstandards required of a person entrusted with national security information. (Tr. 46-47, \n89-98) \nHis character witnesses, who have known him about seven years, testified that \nthey have never seen any signs that he abuses alcohol, and have seen him drink \nappropriately in social situations. They are aware of his criminal history in his youth, and \nassert that he is a loyal and trustworthy person. (Tr. 17-40) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 details the personal conduct security concern: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n22 and the following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents \nof concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol use or whether \nthe individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has a 2019 DWI arrest and conviction, and a 2019 arrest for public \nintoxication. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies to 1.b and 1.c. The toxicology report in the record \nshows that there was no alcohol involved in the 2012 incident, so SOR \u00b61.a is not \nestablished and is found for Applicant. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests are due to immaturity and poor \njudgment in those particular circumstances. He has acknowledged his mistakes, \nlearned from these incidents, and has modified his alcohol consumption and related \nbehaviors accordingly. He has changed the type of friends he associates with to more \nmature friends who are role models. The circumstances that led to both arrests are \nunlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 23 (a) and (b) apply to SOR \u00b61.b and 1.c. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has a 2009 felony conviction for malicious wounding, a 2019 DUI, and \na 2019 public intoxication arrest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction for malicious wounding occurred under \ncircumstances unlikely to recur. Applicant was only 17 at the time, and is now 30 and \nmuch more mature. He no longer uses or buys marijuana, or associates with persons \nwho are involved in criminal activity. So much time has elapsed since this happened, it \nno longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He \ncompleted his sentence and probation. He testified about his rehabilitation, which \nstarted while he was serving time in juvenile prison. He has earned college degrees, \nand successfully started a career in computer programing for a defense contractor. His \nwitnesses and the writers of the letters of recommendation in the record praise his \ncharacter, professionalism, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) apply to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. My comments under Guideline G detail why AG \u00b6 32 (a) applies to \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I considered the testimony of his character \nwitnesses, and his letters of recommendation highlighting his character, trustworthiness \nand reliability. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant established that all of the security concerns have been mitigated by \ntime, circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and rehabilitation. He has explicitly stated \nthat he understands the behavior expected of someone granted access to national \nsecurity information, and is willing and able to meet those standards. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 2, 2020. On \nJuly 16, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2021, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. On August 12, 2021, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including pleadings \nand evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7.

As noted above, Applicant neither \nresponded to the FORM nor objected to Item 5. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 34, is married with two minor children. He earned his high school \ndiploma in 2005. He has been employed as a plant room operator by a hotel since \nFebruary 2020. This is his first application for a security clearance.

In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations \nwithout explanation. His credit reports, dated May 2020 and January 2021, also confirm \nthe alleged debts. (Items 1, 3, 6, 7) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($5,257) was the amount charged by Applicant\u2019s \nformer landlord in about December 2016, when Applicant terminated his apartment lease \nthree to four months early. During the May 2020 security clearance interview (SCI) \nconducted in connection with his SCA background investigation, Applicant expressed an \nintent to pay this debt using funds from a financial account that he anticipated would \nmature in Fall 2020. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 5 at 3-4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,870) is a credit-card account that was charged \noff by the creditor in April 2016. Applicant last made a payment to the creditor in \nSeptember 2015. During his SCI, Applicant explained that he opened this account to \npurchase a washer and dryer.

He did not otherwise disclose any of the SOR debts on his \nSCA. (Item 4 at 37-38) \nDuring his SCI, Applicant was asked if, in the last seven years, he had bills turned \nover to collections or had an account charged off for failure to pay. In response to that \nquestion, he volunteered information about the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and stated that \nno other accounts could be recalled. After being confronted with information about the \ndebts alleged in SOR 1.b through 1.j, Applicant acknowledged and provided additional \ndetails concerning each debt. When asked why he did not list any debts on his SCA, he \nexplained that, until he was confronted with them during the SCI: 1) he had forgotten \nabout the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h, and 2) he was not aware \nof the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j. Although he attempted to list the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a on the SCA with information that he knew, because the information known \nwas incomplete, the system would not accept incomplete account information. He did not \nlist the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f on the SCA because he believed that they \noccurred outside of the seven-year reporting window. (Item 5) \nApplicant was offered an opportunity to provide documentation for the financial \naccounts discussed during his SCI.

Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying condition under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Having considered \nall of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern under this guideline, \nI find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant failed to resolve any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He did \nnot meet his burden to establish that his debts were largely attributable to circumstances \nbeyond his control, or that he acted responsibly to resolve them in any event. I credit him \nwith resolving the $280 unalleged debt and the arrangements he made to resolve the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. However, without documentary proof, I am unable to conclude \nthat he made payments pursuant to that arrangement or that he made arrangements or \npayments towards other debts as he claimed.

Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline F concerns. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and (e) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline could apply: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAlthough Applicant wrote \u201cI admit\u201d in response to the Guideline E allegation (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a) in his SOR Answer, I do not find that it was a knowing and willful admission that he \n\u201cdeliberately\u201d falsified his SCA in light of the record as a whole. Thus, I find that the \nfalsification allegation is controverted. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification.

An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. \nDuring his SCI, Applicant was forthcoming with details about his delinquent debts \nand provided reasonable explanations for his failure to report them on his SCA given his \nbackground and experience. Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the seven-year reporting period \nwith respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, while incorrect, was reasonable \nunder the circumstances. I do not find substantial evidence of an intent on the part of \nApplicant to omit, conceal, or falsify facts from his SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \nestablished. Accordingly, I find SOR \u00b6 2.a in favor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concern \nraised by his SCA omissions. However, he has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all the SOR allegations with explanations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working for his current employer in March 2015.

He submitted AE A \n(attachments A-1, B-1 to B-3, C), which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 30, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations with explanations. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nfor his current employer in March 2015. From 1994 to 2015, he worked for a different \ndefense contractor before he was laid off in February 2015. He is a contract specialist. \nHe has held a security clearance for 38 years. His higher education includes an \nassociate\u2019s, a bachelor\u2019s, and two master\u2019s degrees. He is married (since 1993) and \nhas one adult daughter. (Tr. at 6, 20, 22-23, 25; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely pay his 2016-2019 federal and \nstate taxes, and that he failed to timely file his 2017-2019 federal and state tax returns. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). \nWhile Applicant denied the allegations in his SOR answer, he previously \nadmitted the allegations in his 2020 SCA. Specifically, he admitted that he failed to \ntimely file his 2016-2019 federal and state tax returns and that he failed to pay the taxes \nowed for each of those years to both the state and the federal governments. He \nconfirmed these admissions about his tax delinquencies when he spoke to a defense \ninvestigator in May 2020 during his background investigation. Applicant explained that \nhe failed to file his 2016 returns because he was required to provide documentation to \nsupport his health savings account (HSA) deductions and he claimed he could not find \nthe paperwork so he did not file that year\u2019s return. This led to a snowball effect on his \n2017-2019 returns, which he did not timely file because he had not filed his 2016 \nreturns. At that time, he was preparing his taxes himself without professional \nassistance. He also stated that he did not give the time and priority to working his taxes. \nHe rationalized that because he was having taxes withheld from his paycheck he was \nsatisfying his tax requirement even if he was not filing his returns on time. (Tr. 22-23, \n28; GE 1-2) \nApplicant claims he began working with a tax preparation firm (TPF) in December \n2020 to resolve his tax problems. He provided documentation for some of the results \nfrom his work with the TPF, but several questions remain open. He testified that all of \nhis 2016-2019 federal and state tax return were filed. However, he failed to provide any \ndocumentation of the filing of those returns, either by providing copies of the actual \nreturns or by providing tax transcripts from the IRS or state tax authority. (Tr. 21; AE A) \nHe provided the following: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) a receipt from his state tax authority showing that on January 22, 2022, he paid \n$11,407 toward his 2018 state tax debt. (See AE A, attachment B-1, Ex. 2) (There is no \ninformation about whether this amount paid satisfied the entire debt);  \n(2) a receipt from his state tax authority showing that on January 26, 2022, he paid \n$1,733 toward his 2021 state tax debt. (This debt was not alleged in the SOR) (See AE \nA, attachment B-1, Ex. 3);  \n(3) a receipt from the IRS showing that on July 23, 2021, he paid $5,541 toward his \n2016 federal tax debt. (See AE A, attachment B-2, Ex. 1) (There is no information about \nwhether this amount paid satisfied the entire debt); \n(4) a receipt from the IRS showing that on July 23, 2021, he paid $20,318 toward his \n2017 federal tax debt. (See AE A, attachment B-2, Ex. 2) (There is no information about \nwhether this amount paid satisfied the entire debt); \n(5) a receipt from the IRS showing that on December 14, 2021 (one day before his \nsecurity clearance hearing), he paid $13,290 toward his 2018 federal tax debt. (See AE \nA, attachment B-2, Ex. 3) (There is no information about whether this amount paid \nsatisfied the entire debt); \n(6) a receipt from the IRS showing that on December 14, 2021 (one day before his \nsecurity clearance hearing), he paid $13,835 toward his 2019 federal tax debt. (See AE \nA, attachment B-2, Ex. 4) (There is no information about whether this amount paid \nsatisfied the entire debt). \nApplicant\u2019s documentation showed that as of January 22, 2022, he had not timely \nfiled his 2020 federal or state tax return, due on or before April 15, 2021. This tax filing \ndelinquency was not alleged in the SOR and I will not consider it for disqualification \npurposes, but I may consider it to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of any \nmitigating conditions, and in considering the whole-person factors. The documentation \nalso shows that Applicant intended to hire the TPF to prepare and file his 2021 federal \nand state tax returns. However, this information conflicted with his hearing testimony \nwhere he stated that he intended to prepare his own taxes because he did not need \nassistance from tax professionals. The large tax payments that Applicant made, as \nnoted above, came from funds in his retirement accounts. (Tr. 36, 38; AE A, attachment \nC) \nApplicant also presented two written character recommendations from work \nsupervisors. They expressed their belief that Applicant is a trusted employee and a \nvaluable team member. Applicant also documented his active civic involvement, which \nincluded: receiving The President\u2019s Volunteer Service Award, recognition for ten years \nof service to Junior Achievement, and participating in the American Heart Savior \nprogram as CPR qualified.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2017-2019 federal and state income tax returns, \nor make timely payments toward his 2016-2019 federal and state tax debt. The record \nevidence supports all the SOR allegations. I find the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant documented that he has paid some amounts toward his delinquent \nincome tax debt to both the IRS and the state taxing authority. However, he failed to \nproduce documentation to show that the federal and state tax debts were completely \npaid. Additionally, all his documented payments came after the issuance of the SOR. \nTimely filing his yearly tax returns and paying what he owed was not beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol and also shows irresponsibility on his part. While there is evidence of late \npayments for tax years 2016-2019 of his federal returns and 2018 of his state returns, \nhe did not provide documentary evidence of filed federal or state tax returns for those \nyears. His non-filing and delay in filing shows a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s long civilian work history, his supervisors\u2019 letters of \nsupport, and his civic activities. However, his handling of his tax issues over a multi-year \nperiod causes me to question his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
