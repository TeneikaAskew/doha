He has never \nmarried and has no children. Since August 2020, he has been employed by a defense \ncontractor. (Item 3.) He reported the following periods of unemployment: January 2010 to \nJuly 2014; November 2018 to February 2019, and; March 2020 to August 2020. (Items 3 \nand 7.) \nThe August 3, 2022 SOR alleged three delinquent accounts, two federal student \nloans totaling $60,090 and a delinquent auto loan for $8,840. (Item 1.) Applicant denied \nthose allegations. (Item 2.) \nApplicant attached to his Answer an August 15, 2022 letter to him from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education confirming a defaulted student loan rehabilitation agreement, \nwhereby he will pay $708 per month beginning on October 2, 2022. His signed \nrehabilitation agreement was included with his Response. Failure to make those \npayments will result in the loans becoming delinquent. He did not submit documents \nshowing any payments made under the rehabilitation agreement. (Item 2 and Response.) \nThe student loans were assigned for collection in December 2013. ((Items 4 and 5.) \nApplicant attached to his Answer an August 23, 2022 letter to him from his auto \nloan creditor confirming a settlement agreement, whereby he will pay 35 monthly \npayments of $185 to resolve the debt for less than the full balance. In his Response, he \nsubmitted a cancelled check showing a December 11, 2022 payment of $185 under this \nagreement. If all required payments are not made, the account will not be considered \nsettled. (Item 2 and Response.) The auto loan was assigned for collection in January \n2014. (Item 4.) \nApplicant attributed his three delinquent debts to periods of unemployment. (Item \n7.) He did not specify which period or periods of unemployment caused his financial \ndifficulties. He is \u201ccurrently financially stable\u201d and \u201cis capable of meeting obligations.\u201d \nThere is \u201cnobody that would question [his] ability to live within [his] means.\u201d (Item 7.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are\nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) through 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts \nwere assigned to collections about 10 years ago. That is admittedly quite some \ntime ago. They have, however, remained in collections since that time, even \nthough he claims to be \u201cfinancially stable\u201d and \u201ccapable of meeting [his] \nobligations.\u201d He apparently elected not to meet his SOR debt obligations over \nthose 10 years. That casts doubt on his current reliability. His debts are not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d). Since the SOR was \nissued on August 3, 2022, Applicant has been quite busy. By August 15, 2022, he \nhad arranged to have his two delinquent student loans put into rehabilitation. And \njust over a week later, on August 23, 2022, he arranged an installment settlement \nagreement with his auto creditor and made one payment in December under that \nagreement. \nIt is difficult not to conclude that Applicant\u2019s sudden attention to his \ndelinquent student loans and his delinquent auto loan was prompted by the \nissuance of the SOR. Timing like this is pertinent, as the Appeals Board has \nobserved: \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having been \nplaced on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness . . . are in jeopardy may \nbe disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests are not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n     \nat stake.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018). His debts are \nnot mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 c.:\n \n  \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom she has worked since May 2021. She has never married but has lived with two different long-term cohabitants. She lived with her first cohabitant from about 1997 until 2000. She has lived with her current cohabitant since about June 2014. She has a 24-year-old son whose father is the first cohabitant referenced above. Her son is very intelligent but has certain behavioral issues that require her to financially support him. She earned a high school diploma in 1988 and took some community college courses but did not earn a degree. (Tr. 32, 34-37, 39-43, 45-46; Answer; GE 1, 2) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $46,600 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i). It also alleged her 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and 2002 Chapter 7 discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.j). These delinquencies consist of credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) and federal and state taxes for the 2021 tax year (SOR \u00b6 1.h and SOR \u00b6 1.i, respectively). She admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are established through her admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (SOR; Answer, GE 3-7) Applicant\u2019s financial issues began in about 2000 when her cohabitant was injured and was not able to work.

She has a 24-year-old \nson whose father is the first cohabitant referenced above. Her son is very intelligent but \nhas certain behavioral issues that require her to financially support him. She earned a \nhigh school diploma in 1988 and took some community college courses but did not earn \na degree. (Tr. 32, 34-37, 39-43, 45-46; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s nine delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $46,600 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i). It also alleged her 2001 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition and 2002 Chapter 7 discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.j). These delinquencies \nconsist of credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) and federal and state taxes for the \n2021 tax year (SOR \u00b6 1.h and SOR \u00b6 1.i, respectively). She admitted the SOR \nallegations with additional comments. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \nThe SOR allegations are established through her admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. (SOR; Answer, GE 3-7) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in about 2000 when her cohabitant was injured \nand was not able to work. Later, despite being able to work, he was not employed and \nwas not looking for a job. Having only one income, Applicant paid her bills while she \nwas able, but in about 2001 she could no longer afford to do so. She filed a petition in \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2001 and received a Chapter 7 discharge in March \n2002. She also ended the relationship with her son\u2019s father during this time. (Tr. 45-47; \nAnswer; GE 6) \nAfter her fresh start in March 2002, she began opening additional accounts. She \nlargely stayed current on those accounts until about 2015 when she had some \nunforeseen expenses. She opened the unsecured loan listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a to \nconsolidate some of her credit cards. However, in about 2016, she again began having \ntrouble paying her bills. Her son and mother, who were living together, each had acute \nmental health issues. In about 2016, her cohabitant cheated on her. From June 2019 \nuntil June 2020, she used a credit repair company. Shortly after she stopped using this \ncompany, to protect her son\u2019s mental health and provide for a place where she could \nlive away from her cohabitant if needed, she rented an apartment where her son lives \nand where she can stay. She also pays for a significant portion of her son\u2019s living \nexpenses. (Tr. 35-37, 47-50; Answer; GE 2-5, 7) \nIn 2018, Applicant developed a rare form of glaucoma that required expensive \nmedications and procedures and contributed to her financial strain. Given these health \nand family related added expenses, she could not afford to pay some of her other \nfinancial obligations, including the SOR debts. In May 2021, when she began her new \njob, she started earning about twice as much money as the job she worked from about \n1998 until then.

She enrolled the debts listed in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e in this program. Through this debt consolidation company, as of \nJanuary 2023, she had paid about half of the agreed upon settlement amount on the \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, she also claimed that she did not recognize this debt \nand does not believe it is hers. She has not disputed it with the creditor. In 2019, the \ncredit repair company disputed it on her behalf with the credit reporting agencies. There \nis no evidence of the resolution of the dispute; however, the debt does not appear on \nthe August 2022 or April 2023 credit reports.

She provided documentary evidence of these\nsettlements. In October 2022, she contacted the collection agency and the creditor of\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e to try to \n \n settle that debt, but she claimed that both stated that they\nwere no longer collecting the debt because the statute of limitations had lapsed. This\ndebt is scheduled to be paid pursuant to the terms of her debt consolidation agreement.\nShe claimed that she contacted the creditor of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but the creditor\nhad no record of her in their system, so she has not paid anything on that debt.

She became delinquent on these \ntaxes because she could no longer claim her son as a deduction and did not have \nsufficient income withheld from her wages.

In April 2020, she made a payment arrangement to pay $200 \nper month on her delinquent federal taxes. As of June 2023, she has remained current \non her IRS payment plan. On June 1, 2023, she made a lump sum payment of $8,000 \nto the IRS.

He noted that she is a good person, is altruistic, and \nhas always been good to him. Several family members, friends, and work colleagues \nprovided character reference letters on her behalf. They all referenced her honesty, \nintegrity, reliability, and they believe she would protect sensitive information. (Tr. 21-37; \nAnswer) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs evidenced by her 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and her other financial \ndelinquencies that began as early as 2015, Applicant has a history of being unable to \npay her debts. The above listed conditions are made applicable by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s 2001 bankruptcy petition and 2002 bankruptcy discharge occurred \nover 20 years ago. I find that this conduct occurred long enough ago and infrequently \nenough that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) fully applies to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state income tax delinquencies were caused by her \nfailure to account for her tax withholdings from her wages.

Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to her delinquent \nfederal and state taxes. Apart from her delinquent taxes, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \narose because of domestic issues, her family\u2019s mental health problems, and her \nmedical issues. These conditions were largely beyond her control. To fully avail herself \nof AG \u00b6 20(b), she must also show that she acted responsibly under the circumstances \nwith respect to these debts. I find that her efforts in engaging a credit repair company, a \ndebt consolidation company, and contacting creditors to resolve debts through payment \nshow that she acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to the non-tax related SOR debts. \nWhile Applicant had a phone call with a credit counseling company, she \npresented insufficient evidence that this counseling was from a legitimate or credible \nsource, or that this single phone call provided meaningful financial counseling. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) only partially applies. \nApplicant made payment arrangements with the IRS and the relevant state \ntaxation authority. Her payments to the IRS began in 2020. She has consistently made \nher required monthly payments. She also made a significant lump sum payment from \nher retirement savings toward both debts. She claimed that she will use more money \nfrom her retirement savings to pay her remaining tax debt. I found her to be credible \nwhen she testified that she would resolve her tax debts with retirement savings, and her \n$8,000 payment from that source bolsters her reliability. She is paying on several of her \nother delinquent debts through a debt consolidation company, and she contacted other \ncreditors to make payments and settle SOR debts. For all but two of the remaining SOR \naccounts, she is either making payments or has satisfied those debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. For the above stated reasons, AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to her tax delinquencies. \nWhile she has not made payments on the two remaining debts, she contacted the \ncreditors to try to make payment arrangements, but the creditors effectively would not \naccept her money based upon their internal policies. \nAs several of the mitigating conditions apply, I find that Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. Her financial issues do not cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character evidence and good job performance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. He graduated from high school and completed various \ncertifications. He never married and has no children. He has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since December 2020. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2021. In \nit, he disclosed that from 1975 until April 2021 he used marijuana about once a week. He \nstated, \u201cUsed for pain relief, about \u00bd oz. per year in use.\u201d He stated he did not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future because \u201ccould effect working on the Fed side of [X] business.\u201d \n(Item 3). X is Applicant\u2019s present employer. \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that he used cocaine periodically from 1975 to \nJune 2017. He also said in his SCA that he quit using cocaine three years ago, which is \ninconsistent with the dates he provided. He used it weekly in the 1970s. He said, \u201cquit for \nmany years then [sporadic]. I have quit with no plans to start again.\u201d (Item 3). He said the \nreason he stopped using cocaine was because it is \u201cbad for your health and it is bad for \nyour career.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2021. He told \nthe investigator that he used marijuana from 1975 to 1985 and then resumed using it in \n2010 until April 2021. For the past ten years he used marijuana at home and before then \nhe used it while out with friends. His more recent use consisted of taking \u201ca hit\u201d before \nbed if he could not sleep. He purchased marijuana in the past seven years and his last \npurchase was June 2020. He purchased it through a friend. He purchased it so he could \nuse it to help him sleep. He said he did not intend to purchase marijuana in the future. He \ncontinues to socialize with friends who use marijuana, but said he does not use it with \nthem. He uses it alone. He told the investigator he stopped using it to keep his job. (Item \n4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he used cocaine monthly or quarterly. He would \nuse up to maybe half of a gram. It made him happy. He would use it at his house or his \nfriends or hanging out at a party. He has not purchased cocaine in the last seven years. \nHe explained his motivation was for acceptance. It was around him so he used it too. He \nused it with his brother and a friend. He said he no longer associates with those he used \ncocaine with. He did not elaborate on whether he no longer has contact with his brother. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe said he has changed his behavior to prevent future use.

(Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided details about the type of work \nhe does for his employer. He explained he does not talk about his work to anyone outside \nof work. He was willing to submit to random drug testing. He said his trustworthiness and \nreliability has never been questioned. He would never do anything to jeopardize his \ncareer, country, or family. He noted his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. He stated, \u201cI am a law abiding citizen and although I have had issues in the \npast, I have worked very hard to turn those issues around. This includes going to AA \nmeetings, talking with professionals, seeking professional help as needed.\u201d He further \nstated that he does not intend to travel outside of the country. (AE A) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying the mitigating conditions \nand in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 1975 \nto April 2021. He possessed and used cocaine with varying frequency from about 1975 \nto June 2017. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant has a long history of using marijuana and cocaine. In his answer to the \nSOR and his FORM response, he did not provide significant amplifying information about \nhis marijuana and cocaine use and recent commitment to abstinence. He explained that \nhe quit using marijuana in April 2021 after moving to the federal side of employment in \norder to avoid adverse employment consequences. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply because \nApplicant has been using marijuana for 47 years and has only abstained for about 18 \nmonths. He said he stopped using marijuana for a period and then resumed in 2010 and \nused it as a sleep aide. He did not offer any evidence as to what he is using as an \nalternative sleep aide. I am not convinced, based on his past history, that he will not \nresume using marijuana. Applicant also continues to socialize with friends who use \nmarijuana. \nApplicant stated in his response to the FORM that he is a law-abiding citizen and \none who willingly complies with laws and regulations. Although in some states marijuana \nhas recently been legalized, use and possession of it was illegal for most of the 47 years \nhe was regularly using it. His illegal use of cocaine over a 40-year period certainly \ncontradicts his claim of willingly complying with rules and regulations. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s long history of illegal drug use, I am unable to find that his use was infrequent, \nor happened under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His significant history of using \nillegal drugs cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The email from Department Counsel forwarding HE IV is marked HE V. \nApplicant\u2019s email response is marked HE VI. \nHE IV includes reports and bulletins from the FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS), Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the DoD.

That \nobjection is overruled, and I will take administrative notice of the reports and bulletins. \n(Items I-VI, XIII-XV) HE IV also includes a criminal complaint, supporting affidavits, U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) press releases, and an indictment. (Items VII-XII) \nApplicant objected to those documents. The objection to administrative notice of the \ncriminal complaint, supporting affidavits, DOJ press releases, and indictment (Items VII-\nXII) is sustained, and I will not take administrative notice of those documents. I am \nadmitting those documents as Government exhibits over Applicant\u2019s objection. They will \nkeep the same marking for clarification purposes.  \nWhile I did not accept all the documents for administrative notice, I accept and \nadopt the facts contained in those documents. The following is based on the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits and administrative notice documents. It documents what is \ncurrently known by the U.S. Government about Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs), \nQAnon, and Three Percenters, identified in this decision also by the terms III%ers, \n3%ers, and Threepers. The following does not necessarily reflect what Applicant knew \nabout them when he took the actions alleged in the SOR. \nDomestic Violent Extremists  \nOne of the most significant terrorism threats to the United States we face today is \nposed by lone actors and small groups of individuals who commit acts of violence \nmotivated by a range of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances. Of these actors, \nDVEs represent one of the most persistent threats to the United States today. These \nindividuals are often radicalized online and look to conduct attacks with easily \naccessible weapons. Many of these violent extremists are motivated and inspired by a \nmix of ideological, socio-political, and personal grievances against their targets. \nA DVE is defined as an individual based and operating primarily within the United \nStates or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or \nother foreign power who seeks to further political or social goals, wholly or in part, \nthrough unlawful acts of force or violence dangerous to human life. \nDHS assesses that racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVEs) \nand militia violent extremists (MVEs) present the greatest DVE threats, with RMVEs \nbeing the most persistent and lethal threats to conduct mass-casualty attacks against \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncivilians, and MVEs typically targeting law enforcement and government personnel and \nfacilities. There have also been examples of both RMVEs and MVEs targeting critical \ninfrastructure, including against the electric sector, among others.  \nRMVEs and MVEs are the primary DVE concern, given the lethality of the threat \nand incident data. While specific motives vary, many attackers share common \nbehavioral characteristics and often connect with a grievance to justify their use of \nviolence. \nRMVEs and anti-authority/anti-government violent extremists are inspired by \nvarious violent extremist ideologies or perceived personal grievances, often cultivated \nthrough the consumption of online content or motivated by conspiracy theories. This \nresults in many DVEs with hybrid ideological beliefs that do not fit into traditional \ncategories. \nSome DVEs view the January 6th event as a success. Conspiracy theories, such \nas QAnon, likely will also inspire some DVEs and others to engage in more sporadic, \nlone actor or small cell violence against common DVE targets, including racial, ethnic, \nor religious minorities and institutions, law enforcement, and government officials and \nbuildings. \nIdeologies driven by such DVEs often are reinforced by a variety of online \ncontent, including conspiracy theories and political commentary they view as \ncontroversial. Current events that DVEs perceive as infringing on their worldviews often \ncontribute to periods of increased ideologically motivated violence, including recently \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lawful protests. \nThe Intelligence Community assesses that DVEs exploit a variety of popular \nsocial media platforms, smaller websites with targeted audiences, and encrypted chat \napplications to recruit new adherents, plan and rally support for in-person actions, and \ndisseminate materials that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence. \nThe FBI warned that the mere advocacy of political or social positions, political \nactivism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophical embrace of violent tactics \nmay not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected. (GE 4 at 137; Item \nIII) \nThree Percenters (III%ers, 3%ers, or Threepers) \nThe definition of Three Percenter has evolved over the last three-plus years. In \nJune 2020, the FBI Joint Intelligence Bulletin reported: \nMilitia extremists sometimes call themselves three percenters (III%ers) \nbased on the myth that only three percent of American colonists took up \narms against the British during the Revolutionary War. Some III%ers \nregard the present-day US Government as analogous to British authorities \nduring the Revolution in terms of infringements on civil liberties. While \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmany independent or multi-state militia groups incorporate III% in their unit \nnames, the term is less indicative of membership in a single overarching \ngroup than it is representative in a common belief in the notion that a small \nforce with a just cause can overturn a tyrannical government if armed and \nprepared. Self-identification as a III%er or use of III% symbols should \nnot independently be considered evidence of militia affiliation or \nillegal activity. (Emphasis added) (GE 4 at 138) \nIn December 2020, the FBI Domestic Terrorism Reference Guide reported that \nsome militia MVEs call themselves III%ers, and added that III%ers: \nRefers to a militia-movement based on the myth that only three percent of \nAmericans fought against the British during the American Revolutionary \nWar. Adherents use the myth to pledge or justify their willingness to use \nforce to resist restrictions on firearms or civil liberties against the present-\nday US Government and other government entities, which are viewed as \nakin to the British during the Revolution. Self-identification as a III%er or \nuse of III% symbols should not independently be considered \nevidence of militia affiliation or illegal activity. (Emphasis added) (Item \nVI) \nSeveral militia-style organizations incorporated have Three Percenters and \nPatriots into their names or logos, including the Michigan United Patriots Three Percent, \nthe California Patriots, and the Texas Three Percenters. The Guardians of Freedom \nhave \u201cIII\u201d in their logo. A number of individuals who identified as members of Three \nPercenter militias were arrested and convicted for crimes related to the breach of the \nU.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. \nQAnon \nIn United States v. Perna, an FBI Special Agent presented the FBI assessment \nof QAnon: \nQAnon is a sprawling, discredited, anti-establishment conspiracy theory \nthat originated from postings on online message boards by an anonymous \nindividual known as \u201cQ.\u201d Q claims to be a high-level government official \nwith a Q clearance and access to classified information. Central to the \nQAnon conspiracy theory is the false belief that the world is run by a cabal \nof Satan-worshipping pedophiles and child-traffickers (allegedly largely \ncomprised of prominent Democratic politicians, so-called \u201cDeep State\u201d \ngovernment employees, journalists, and Hollywood elite) and that \nPresident Trump is secretly working with Q and others to take down the \ncabal. Many QAnon adherents (known as \u201cAnons\u201d) refer to themselves as \n\u201cdigital soldiers\u201d and believe they are engaged in an epic battle between \ngood and evil and darkness and light. Following the November 3, 2020 \nelection, many QAnon adherents began pushing false and discredited \ntheories of massive voter fraud and that the 2020 election had been \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cstolen\u201d from President Trump. Other prominent QAnon adherents \nexhorted the \u201cAnons\u201d to \u201ctrust the plan,\u201d believing that President-Elect \nBiden\u2019s victory is illusory and part of a convoluted plan by Q and others to \nreveal the crimes of the cabal to the world, resulting in President Trump \nsecuring a second term. QAnon believers are waiting for two major \nevents, which they refer to as the \u201cthe Storm\u201d and the \u201cGreat Awakening.\u201d \nThe \u201cStorm\u201d refers to a day of violence which will result in mass arrests, \nmilitary trials, and executions of the members of the cabal. According to \nQAnon lore, \u201cthe Storm\u201d will be followed by the \u201cGreat Awakening,\u201d which \ngenerally refers to the belief that the truth of the central tenets of QAnon \nwill be revealed to the world.  \nIn May 2019, the FBI assessed that anti-government, identity based, and fringe \npolitical conspiracy theories, such as QAnon, very likely motivate some domestic \nextremists, wholly or in part, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity. The FBI \nfurther assesses in some cases these conspiracy theories very likely encourage the \ntargeting of specific people, places, and organizations, thereby increasing the likelihood \nof violence against these targets. \nOne key assumption driving these assessments is that certain conspiracy theory \nnarratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action. The FBI also assumes that some, \nbut not all, individuals or domestic extremists who hold such beliefs will act on them. \nIn June 2022, a joint special analysis assessed that adherence to elements of the \ncontinuously evolving QAnon conspiracy theory\u2014some of which are bolstered by the \nresonance of election fraud narratives\u2014will contribute to the radicalization and \nmobilization to violence of a small number of DVEs, posing a threat to individuals and \ninstitutions that supporters of the conspiracy theory have prominently denounced. Some \nself-identifying QAnon adherents participated in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on \nJanuary 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He stated that \nhe became aware of the III symbol because it was reported that an NFL player had the \nsymbol as a tattoo.1 (GE 3, 4 at 38-39) \nThe military criminal investigation division did a criminal and insider-threat \nanalysis and determined that Applicant was not suspected of committing a criminal \noffense or being an insider threat. The military criminal investigation division did not \nopen an investigation, with the following rationale in an email dated January 15, 2021: \n1. Social media was identified with no derogatory information noted. \n2. The FBI has not designated the 3%ers or QAnon as a terrorist \norganization. Neither of them are organized groups. \n3. The 3%er sticker alone is not an indicator of militia affiliation (see \nattached [FBI Joint Information Bulletin identified in above Evidence \nsection] and below for more details.  \n4. While an internet search for three percenters (III%) and QAnon will yield \nseveral sites declaring them anti-government, militia linked, or conspiracy \ntheorists; as with any group there are those who take matters to the \nextreme and those who are more conservative in their voice.

(GE 4 at 133) \nAn administrative investigation was ordered and completed by a U.S. military \nfield grade officer. The investigation disclosed that the vehicle belonged to Applicant. \nThe Three Percenter sticker has III inside a circle of stars. The QAnon sticker is a \nstylized Q with a skull inside. Applicant bought the III sticker on eBay for $20 and placed \nit on his vehicle in about June 2020. He bought the QAnon sticker on eBay for $10 and \nplaced it on his vehicle in about January 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline A, Allegiance to the United States \nThe security concern for allegiance to the United States is set out in AG \u00b6 3: \nThe willingness to safeguard classified or sensitive information is in doubt \nif there is any reason to suspect an individual\u2019s allegiance to the United \nStates. There is no positive test for allegiance, but there are negative \nindicators. These include participation in or support for acts against the \nUnited States or placing the welfare or interests of another country above \nthose of the United States. Finally, the failure to adhere to the laws of the \nUnited States may be relevant if the violation of law is harmful to stated \nU.S. interests. An individual who engages in acts against the United States \nor provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 4. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) involvement in, support of, training to commit, or advocacy of any act \nof sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition against the United \nStates; \n(b) association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to commit, or \nwho are committing, any of the above acts; and \n(c) association or sympathy with persons or organizations that advocate, \nthreaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or \nunconstitutional means, in an effort to: \n(1) overthrow or influence the U.S. Government or any state or \nlocal government; \n(2) prevent Federal, state, or local government personnel from \nperforming their official duties; \n(3) gain retribution for perceived wrongs caused by the Federal, \nstate, or local government; and \n(4) prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution \nor laws of the United States or of any state. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is \u201cassociated with and sympathetic to the \nideologies of the Three Percenters, a domestic militia that advocates resistance to \ncertain U.S. federal policies. Supporters of the Three Percenters were present at the \ninsurrection that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\u201d \nThe first issue is whether the \u201cThree Percenters\u201d is a domestic militia. Clearly \nsome militia violent extremists call themselves Three Percenters, and some militias \nhave added that to their name. It is not an entity, such as the Ku Klux Klan or the \nAmerican Nazi Party, where to identify oneself as part of the organization is to identify \noneself as an extremist. As the FBI reported: \u201cWhile many independent or multi-state \nmilitia groups incorporate III% in their unit names, the term is less indicative of \nmembership in a single overarching group than it is representative in a common belief in \nthe notion that a small force with a just cause can overturn a tyrannical government if \narmed and prepared.\u201d \nWhile the Three Percenters math is wrong, their \u201ccommon belief in the notion that \na small force with a just cause can overturn a tyrannical government if armed and \nprepared\u201d is not in and of itself problematic. That belief worked in 1776. This planet is \nfull of countries with tyrannical governments. The world would be a better place if more \nof those countries\u2019 citizens were able to overthrow their dictators. The problem in this \ncountry is not in the common belief; it is when the followers of that belief also believe \nthe U.S. Government is \u201ca tyrannical government\u201d that needs to be overthrown. \nApplicant credibly denied that he is a Three Percenter, that he has ever been a \nmember of a militia or any similar group, or that he supports or is sympathetic to any \nextremist group. He was horrified by the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He \ntestified that he did not understand the full meaning of the III sticker, and that he came \nacross it on eBay. \nBased on the information available at the time of the 2021 investigation, the \nmilitary criminal investigation division did a criminal and insider-threat analysis and \ndetermined that Applicant did not commit a crime and was not an insider threat, with the \nfollowing in an email dated January 15, 2021: \nThe FBI has not designated the 3%ers or QAnon as a terrorist \norganization. Neither of them are organized groups. \nThe 3%er sticker alone is not an indicator of militia affiliation (see attached \n[FBI Joint Information Bulletin identified in above Evidence section] and \nbelow for more details.  \nWhile an internet search for three percenters (III%) and QAnon will yield\nseveral sites declaring them anti-government, militia linked, or conspiracy\ntheorists; as with any group there are those who take matters to the\n \n \n \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextreme and those who are more conservative in their voice. Displaying a \nsticker in support of either group does not make an individual a threat. \nApplicant had no connection to Three Percenters beyond the sticker. An \nexamination of his government computer and search history revealed numerous \nsearches and websites connected to QAnon, but nothing associated with Three \nPercenters, III%ers, or Threepers. No co-worker ever recalled Applicant making any \nreference to Three Percenters. Some militias have added Three Percent to their name. \nSome militias have also added words like \u201cPatriot\u201d to their names. That does not mean \nthat someone who identifies as a patriot also identifies with the militias. With the power \nof hindsight and the passage of about four years, we now see the connections some \nThree Percenters have to militia groups. It does not seem fair to hold Applicant to \nknowledge that even the military criminal investigation division did not have at the time. I \nam not convinced that Applicant drew the connection when he placed the III sticker on \nhis vehicle. Nor am I convinced he associated with or sympathized with a Three \nPercenter domestic militia. There are no disqualifying conditions applicable to SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, and it is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is \u201cassociated with and sympathetic to the \nideologies of QAnon, a political conspiracy theory that had supporters present at the \ninsurrection that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\u201d \nTo many people, QAnon is a joke that cannot be taken seriously. That may be \ntrue, but QAnon is also dangerous. The FBI assessed that fringe political conspiracy \ntheories, such as QAnon, very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in \npart, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity. Certain conspiracy theory \nnarratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action. The FBI also assumes that some, \nbut not all, individuals who hold such beliefs will act on them. Some self-identifying \nQAnon adherents participated in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. \nI do not believe that Applicant ever intended to commit or support any violent act \nagainst the U.S. Government, but his connections to QAnon brought him into \nassociation with those who did. AG \u00b6\u00b6 4.b and 4.c are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate allegiance to the United States security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 5. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual was unaware of the unlawful aims of the individual or \norganization and severed ties upon learning of these; \n(c) involvement in the above activities occurred for only a short period of \ntime and was attributable to curiosity or academic interest; and \n(d) the involvement or association with such activities occurred under such \nunusual circumstances, or so much time has elapsed, that it is unlikely to \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or allegiance. \nApplicant thought QAnon was \u201cbasically an online repository of information. \nThere\u2019s no ideology. A person can go in and access it and do their own research on it.\u201d \nHe stated that it is \u201ckind of like a big puzzle,\u201d and \u201ckind of like the Da Vinci Code.\u201d He did \nnot agree with everything on QAnon. He felt the QAnon message he sent was anti-\nracist, and promoted unification, not division. He now feels that he was misinformed. He \ndoes not intend to have any further connection in any way to QAnon. \nAny person who supports violent acts against the U.S. Government should not \nhold a security clearance. As indicated above, I do not believe Applicant is one of those \nindividuals. Applicant\u2019s interest in QAnon was limited and did not involve any deeper \nnefarious motives. It does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \nallegiance. Guideline A security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nOn numerous occasions, Applicant accessed QAnon-affiliated websites and \nsocial media using his government computer system. On June 29, 2020, and June 30, \n2020, he sent emails through his government email account to three other federal \nemployees. Attached to the emails were documents that contained QAnon-associated \nrhetoric. \nThe Government did not produce any specific rules or regulation that Applicant \nviolated. At a minimum, DoD Regulation 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (August 30, \n1993), as amended (JER), is applicable. The JER provides that \u201cFederal Government \ncommunication systems and equipment (including Government owned telephones, \nfacsimile machines, electronic mail, internet systems, and commercial systems when \nuse is paid for by the Federal Government) shall be for official use and authorized \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurposes only.\u201d (JER, subsection 2-301.a.) The JER provides exceptions, including \nwhat could be described as the de minimis exception. However, it specifically excludes \nfrom those exceptions: \n[U]ses that would reflect adversely on DoD or the DoD Component (such \nas uses involving pornography; chain letters; unofficial advertising, \nsoliciting or selling except on authorized bulletin boards established for \nsuch use; violations of statute or regulation; inappropriately handled \nclassified information; and other uses that are incompatible with public \nservice. (JER, subsection 2-301.a.(2)(d)) \nApplicant used his government computer and email for an unauthorized purpose \nthat does not fit within any of the exceptions. AG \u00b6 40(e) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nQAnon can be many things to many people, and it is not always obviously \nsubversive. The above discussion under Guideline A applies equally here. I believe \nApplicant made mistakes, but I am convinced that he has learned from the experience. \nThe above behavior happened under unique circumstances; it is unlikely to recur; and it \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions are applicable. Use of information technology security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges the allegations under Guideline A and M. With slight \nvariations, SOR \u00b6 3.a essentially alleges the same conduct, but adds that Applicant was \nbarred from all military installations in Country A for ten years and terminated from his \nemployment. The debarment and termination do not constitute conduct. They are the \nresults of conduct. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Because there are slight \nvariations in the alleged conduct in the two allegations, I am not going to resolve one in \nApplicant\u2019s favor before they are analyzed. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur; and \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are mitigated under the same rationale \ndiscussed above under Guidelines A and M. Applicant\u2019s conduct happened under \nunique circumstances that are unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. Because all of the personal conduct security concerns are mitigated, it is \nunnecessary to resolve one of the duplicate allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines A, E, and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nApplicant is either a na\u00efve patriot who bought III and QAnon stickers and was \nsomewhat enthralled by QAnon without fully understanding their significance and the \nunderlying dangers associated with those entities, or he is a supporter of domestic \nterrorism who was able to keep that hidden from all who knew him best. For all the \nreasons discussed above, I am convinced he is the former. I believe his co-worker \ncorrectly summarized the situation in his statement for the investigation: \u201c[Applicant] has \nnever represented himself as anything other than being patriotic. I think he got himself \ncaught up in something he didn\u2019t know what he was getting into.\u201d \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines A, E, and M. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline A: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(GE 3) \nApplicant did not report his cocaine use that occurred just the month before his \nstatement. He wrote in the statement that high school \u201cwas the last time [he] used \ncocaine.\u201d He used marijuana about two to three times after he submitted the statement \nto his security officer. He fully reported his illegal drug use on the SF 86 he submitted in \nJuly 2021 and during his background interview in October 2021. He initially testified that \nhe had never used cocaine before the two recent times. He then admitted that he used \ncocaine in high school. (Tr. at 37-38, 49-52; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since he last smoked marijuana in \nMarch 2020. His wife also no longer uses illegal drugs. The friend he smoked marijuana \nwith stopped using marijuana, and the neighbor he used cocaine with moved away. \nApplicant used to drink regularly. In about November 2022, he and his wife decided to \nsignificantly cut down on their drinking and concentrate on their children and other \nactivities. He estimates that he has had a total of fewer than ten drinks since then. He is \ncommitted to remaining drug free. He realizes that he made poor decisions when he \nused illegal drugs. He is willing to accept the consequences of his conduct.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana on about ten occasions from about 2016 through \nMarch 2020 and cocaine twice in May 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant held a security clearance and was in a sensitive position during all the \nabove drug use, but only his marijuana use between about October 2017 and January \n2019 occurred while he was granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case \nNo. 22-01661 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2023). AG \u00b6 25(g) is applicable to his marijuana \nuse between about October 2017 and January 2019. AG \u00b6 25(g) is not applicable to his \ncocaine use and his marijuana use while he did not have access to classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) for a \ndiscussion on the distinction between holding a security clearance and having access to \nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana while granted access to classified information and \ncocaine while holding a security clearance.

He was less than completely frank during his June 2019 statement to his \nsecurity officer. He wrote that his cocaine use in high school was the last time he used \ncocaine, when he had used it twice in the previous month. He then used marijuana two \nto three times after he submitted that statement. Applicant appears to be on the right \ntrack, and if he continues to abstain from illegal drug use, he will once again be a good \ncandidate for a security clearance. At this time, he is not. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his two deployments to Afghanistan. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. He has owned his home since 1996. He has been employed \nby his corporate clearance sponsor since February 1986.

(Item 2.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. (Item 1S.) He admitted that allegation with a \ndetailed text explaining why he is tardy filing his tax returns. (Item 1A.) The following is a \nsynopsis in his words of the salient points of his Answer. \nNon filing of returns for 2018, 2019, and 2020 \nI have listed procrastination as the reason . . . More correctly I should have called \nthis, \u201cNot enough time to get it all done\u201d. . . My unfiled taxes are not the greatest priority \nfor the following reasons. I always have greater withholding done from my income so that \nI am guaranteed a sizable refund . . . I do not ever come up short on taxes paid so I do \nnot ever incur a shortage of tax already paid, or interest and penalties. For me, the IRS \nis always a savings account that pays me back my money when I do get around to filing \ntaxes. \nThese are some things that occupy my time and do not allow me to do things I \nwould prefer to be getting done, like taxes, in a timely manner. \nWork schedule at [my employer] demands from me to work 50-60 (and \nsometimes more) hours each week. A lot of work and not enough people are the main \nreason for this. I was not able to take the vacation this year that I wanted to because . . . \nmanagement [could] not let me go because of schedule demands. I finally did get \napproval for one week this year. Because of this I had to forfeit 140 hours of vacation . . . \nand have it paid out to me . . . . \nDeath of two family members, Father-in-Law 2016 and Aunt 2018. I was made \nexecutor of both of their estates . . . trustee of . . . [father-in-law\u2019s] trust.

So it was left to me to get [it] done. My wife has no siblings . . . It takes a lot of time  \nTo do this, especially if you have never done this type of thing before . . . [Y]ou must \nlocate the required documentation which is the biggest use of time.  \nCare of disabled wife. In 1999 my wife suffered from a brain tumor the size of a golf ball. \nShe had three brain surgeries and extensive radiation treatments. She survived this and \nis still alive, despite her doctors saying she would not live past two years. Well, thank \nGod, she is still alive, but at the cost of diminished mental capacity, making her 100% \ndisabled. She used to be a very smart [professional], but now, she is not. She was doing \nreasonably well considering what she went through, but now twenty years later, her \nmental abilities are going further downhill. She has . . . an infection where the bone in her \nskull has died off in a several inches square area. This is because the radiation treatment \nback in 1999 and now the infection defies treatment . . . After seeing several . . . specialists \n. . . , she was referred to [a hospital] for surgery that her doctor here says is going to be \na big deal (his words) and will require a multi-discipline surgery team to cut out the dead, \ninfected bone, and now at a later date, replace it with a titanium plate. She was finally \nscheduled . . . for brain surgery. Every time I take her to the doctor, I must make up the \ntime at my job because schedules here wait for no one . . . I was lucky to receive two \nweeks of FMLA from my employer . . . My wife has now undergone the surgery to cut out \nthe dead infected bone from her head on Feb. 25, 2022. She was on the neurosurgery \nfloor . . . for 7 days. When she returned home, I as her caregiver had to swap out the IV \nbag and change the IV infusion lines that delivered antibiotics into her body via an IV \npump, to stop the infection in her head, every day for six weeks. Except for the two weeks \nof FMLA leave, I had to work and at the same time perform the medical care for my wife \n. . . to fight the infection. \nNow another medical problem for my wife.

(Item 1A.) \nIn his Personal Subject Interview, Applicant stated: \u201cI usually do several returns in \nbatch mode once I get into the mode of doing taxes and I do not ever come up short on \ntaxes paid, and I do not ever incur a shortage of tax already paid or interest and for me \nthe IRS is always a savings account that pays me back my money when I do get around \nto filing my taxes.\u201d (Item 3.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s IRS Account Transcripts for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 show no \ntax balances owed or refunds due for those years.

(Item \n4.)  \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. A2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is the only one applicable in this case: \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns . . .  \nas required. \nThe SOR\u2019s alleged unfiled federal income tax returns are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b619 (f) applies. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . .), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  \nApplicant\u2019s challenges began in 1999, when his wife developed a brain tumor that \nwas diagnosed to be fatal within two years. With additional surgeries and radiation \ntreatments over the years, she survived. And she is alive today. The price she and her \nfamily paid was her diminished mental capacity, far from being the smart professional she \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nonce was. That price is still being paid. The latest is that a portion of her skull has died \nbecause of an infection caused by years of radiation treatment. She had serious surgery \nin February 2022 to remove the infected bone from her skull. More surgery will likely be \nneeded. \nThe medical care Applicant\u2019s wife needed from him after that surgery and his own \nwork demands stole time from everyday issues like filing tax returns. He functioned as an \nin-home nurse and prioritized household needs as best he could. Having shepherded his \nwife through her latest brain surgery, he had to face another medical problem with his \nwife. She needed colon surgery in June 2022 and was hospitalized for four days. \nIn addition to handling his wife\u2019s medical problems, Applicant was confronted by \ntwo deaths in the family. His father-in-law died in 2016, and an aunt died in 2018. He was \nnamed the executor of their estates and the trustee of his father-in-law\u2019s trust. Having \nnever served in those capacities before, Applicant expended a great deal of time with \nthese tasks, losing time that he could have spent on his own household chores like \npreparing tax returns. He summed it up in his Answer: \u201cNot enough time to get it all done.\u201d \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed \nwith her brain tumor in 1999, a diagnosis and consequences that she and Applicant have \nlived with ever since. Sadly, the consequences of that diagnosis are likely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s perseverance over the years is commendable. It seems, however, that over \nthose years, he has a developed a practice of doing his tax returns late and in \u201cbatches\u201d \nonce he gets into \u201cthe mode of doing taxes.\u201d That practice of doing his taxes when he \ngets around to them is what is also likely to recur. And that practice raises security \nconcerns. I find that AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). There is no question that \nApplicant confronted conditions \u201clargely beyond his control.\u201d The next inquiry is whether \nhe acted \u201cresponsibly\u201d in light of those conditions. For the reasons stated under the AG \u00b6 \n20(a) discussion, his practice of doing his tax returns when he gets into the \u201cmode\u201d of \ndoing taxes is not responsible conduct under his admittedly adverse circumstances. I find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a :     \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After several surgeries and continuous \ntreatment, she awoke from her coma and appeared to be recovering. Just when she \nshe appeared to be recovering, she developed a lung infection and died in May 2017. \nFrom the time of her brain aneurism in 2014 until she passed away from a lung infection \nin 2017, she was continuously in a hospital or care facility. (Item 1) \nIn August 2018, a few months after Applicant\u2019s mother passed away, his father \nwas diagnosed with prostate cancer. Fifteen months later, his father died in November \n2019. Throughout this process Applicant\u2019s mother and father accrued numerous and \nsubstantial medical bills and funeral expenses. Although Medicare paid their portion of \nthe bills, Applicant and his siblings found themselves responsible for the balance. Since \nApplicant was not married, his married siblings prevailed upon him to pay the majority of \nthese bills. (Item 1) \nIn the summer of 2019, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend was laid off from her job and shortly \nthereafter was diagnosed with breast cancer. In addition to her breast cancer diagnosis, \nshe developed a heart condition that required medical treatment. Since his girlfriend \nwas no longer employed, she did not have health care insurance and Applicant paid for \nher medical bills. (Item 1) \nTo pay for these unplanned medical and funeral expenses, Applicant drew credit \ncard cash advances and took out a personal bank loan to offset his credit card debts. \nHe made the decision to pay off his credit card balances and personal loan rather than \npaying his taxes because his credit cards had higher balances when compared to the \ntaxes he owed. He has since paid off all of his credit card debt and personal loan as \nwell as his automobile loan. (Item 1) \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM noted that Applicant filed his tax returns for the tax \nyears at issue; however, he emphasized that his returns were not timely filed. \nDepartment Counsel also said that Applicant did not submit any evidence that he is on a \npayment plan with the IRS. A review of the FORM indicates that Applicant e-filed his \n2016 Federal and state tax return on June 19, 2017, that he mailed his 2017 and 2018 \nFederal and state tax returns on February 1, 2022, and that he e-filed his 2019 and \n2020 Federal and state tax returns in January 2022. (Item 1) \nApplicant stated in his Response to Interrogatories that he is working with an IRS \napproved collection agency (CA) and that as soon as they received updates from the \nIRS regarding his 2017 and 2018 income tax returns, they would set up a payment plan \nfor him. Although Applicant was unable to set up a payment plan with the CA at the time \nhe submitted his FORM response, he did provide evidence that he made direct \npayments to the IRS as follows: (1) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on December 3, 2021 \nfor tax year 2016; (2) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on June 6, 2022 for tax year 2016; \nand (3) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on June 6, 2022 for tax year 2019.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility \nfor proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nThe potentially applicable financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority, to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant described circumstances beyond his control, which adversely affected \nhis finances. In summary, over a four-year period Applicant lost both of his parents to \nprolonged illnesses. As the only unmarried sibling, he took on the lion\u2019s share of the \nuncovered medical expenses as well as the funeral expenses for his parents. Shortly \nafter Applicant\u2019s parents passed away, his girlfriend was laid off from her job and was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. As she did not have health care insurance, Applicant \nagreed to pay for her medical expenses. By any objective standard, the loss of both \nparents after lengthy illnesses in a four-year period followed by one\u2019s significant other \nbeing diagnosed with breast cancer is not only beyond one\u2019s control but is also \ntraumatic. Faced with significant debt, Applicant fell behind not only on his credit card \nand personal loan debt but neglected to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes. \nHe made the decision to first address his credit card and personal loan debt. In \nretrospect, Applicant recognizes that this choice was not the most prudent one. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there\nis more than one delinquent debt, and his financial problems are not isolated.

A component is whether he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Although Applicant clearly \nexperienced circumstances beyond his control with the passing of his parents and \ncancer diagnosis of his girlfriend, he neglected his responsibility to remain current on his \nincome taxes. However, since he regained his emotional and financial bearings, he has \nproceeded with all due diligence to address his tax issues. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant made a number of direct payments to the IRS before establishing a \npayment plan with an IRS approved collection agency to pay his delinquent taxes. His \npayment plan with the CA is measured, paid by direct debit, shows a good-faith effort, \nand demonstrates his commitment to regaining financial responsibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) partially apply and AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) fully apply. Security concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have weighed \nthe evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

(GE 1 at 44-45, 54) He testified that he incurred the loans while attending a \ntechnical school and made required payments until about 2012. After he fell behind on \npayments due to underemployment, his forbearance request was granted. He learned \nthat his student loans might be forgiven in about 2009 and joined a class action lawsuit \nagainst the school in 2015.

(GE 3 at 3, GE 2 at 8) This debt is being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit card placed for collection of $453. Applicant admitted the \nallegation in his Answer, noting that he was working with the creditor to settle the \nremaining balance. He reported the debt in his June 2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 50-51) He \ntestified that the debt remained outstanding, that he intended to pay it off, and that the \ncreditor rejected his February 2023 settlement offer. (Tr. 46-47) Credit reports reflect the \naccount was in collection for $454 in July 2020 and for $453 in January 2022. (GE 4 at \n14, GE 3 at 3) This debt is not resolved. \nIn his June 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed approximately $62,000 of delinquent \ndebt including the debts alleged in the SOR, and delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR \n(Non-SOR) totaling about $8,200.

(AE G; Tr. 71) \nI found Applicant's responses and demeanor at the hearing to be credible and \nconsistent with his SCA, Answer and someone who was reliably telling the truth. After \nreviewing the entire record, I find that his hearing testimony is corroborated by \ndocumentary evidence submitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly \nresponded to all questions and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts \nand establishing his financial responsibility. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nThose debts are resolved, occurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely, and \ndo not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s periods of \nunemployment and underemployment were largely beyond their control. One component \nof acting responsibly is maintenance of contact with creditors. Although he has acted \nresponsibly by prioritizing and paying some of his delinquent debts, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established because Applicant has not received financial \ncounselling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. Applicant \nnegotiated payment agreements for these debts before the SOR was issued, made \npayments in accordance with those agreements, and has substantially reduced the \nbalances due. Although the $453 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is unresolved, Applicant plans \nto resolve it in the near future. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual \nmake payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR \nfirst, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only \nestablish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement \nthe plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record including \nApplicant\u2019s education and work history. I also considered that his financial problems were \ncaused, in part, by circumstances beyond his control including unemployment, \nunderemployment, health issues, and responsibilities related to support of a large family. \nApplicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He has a logical and \nappropriate plan for resolving the remaining SOR debts, and there are clear indications \nthat his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. His income has \nsignificantly increased, and he understands the security implications of delinquent debt. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in \nhis debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that \n[he] act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017). Applicant understands what he needs to do to maintain his financial responsibility. \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole supports \na conclusion that the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, \nare mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n1 The SOR did not allege that Applicant owed taxes for 2021.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal \nincome tax returns when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable to those tax years. \nApplicant\u2019s request for an extension to file his 2020 federal income tax return was \ngranted to October 15, 2021. The IRS received the 2020 return on October 20, 2021. \nFor security clearance purposes, that is not late. The language in SOR \u00b6 1.a referring to \ntax year 2020 is concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant did not pay federal income taxes when they were due for tax years \n2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, resulting in a tax debt in June 2022 of \nabout $196,000. AG \u00b6 19(f) is also applicable based on the unpaid taxes. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues started in about 2013 when he was working overseas. His \nsecond wife was a foreign national, and he supported her and her family throughout the \nimmigration process. He had health issues, his mother passed away, and he was laid \noff a job in 2013. He withdrew about $30,000 from his 401(k) retirement account for his \nmother-in-law\u2019s surgery and about another $80,000 for living expenses. He did not \nproperly account for the tax consequences. He was overwhelmed and did not file his tax \nreturns. \nApplicant is credited with filing all of the past-due returns. He has an installment \nagreement, and since September 2022, he has paid a total of $36,400, reducing the \ntotal owed to $164,786. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nIn 2017, Applicant paid the IRS about $2,050, which went toward his 2012 taxes. \nIn 2018, he paid about $3,423, which went toward his 2012 and 2015 taxes. In 2019, he \npaid about $2,872, which went toward his 2015 and 2016 taxes. That means from 2017 \nthrough 2019, he paid about $8,345 toward his 2012, 2015, and 2016 taxes. The 2012 \nand 2015 tax years are paid. Those numbers sound good, but while he was making \nthose payments, his tax liability was increasing because he was not paying all of the \ntaxes due for those years. Even without accounting for penalties and interest, he \nunderpaid his 2017 taxes by $8,910; his 2018 taxes by $2,354; and his 2019 taxes by \n$20,604, for a total of about $31,868. \nApplicant did not make any payments toward his back taxes from November \n2019 through August 2022. After being interviewed for his background investigation in \nDecember 2019, he did not file his 2019 federal income tax return until March 2021, and \nhe did not pay his 2019, 2020, and 2021 taxes when they were due. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes \non time continues to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns and paid taxes \nis insufficient to overcome the years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to file his tax \nreturns and pay his taxes when they were due. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except 2020, \nwhich is found for Applicant) \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 3, 7) Applicant was married from April 1996 to \nJuly 2008. That marriage ended by divorce. He has two adult children, ages 34 and 25. \nApplicant indicated that he has been residing with a cohabitant since November 2015. \n(Items 3, 7) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army and Army National Guard (ANG) as both an \nenlisted soldier and officer from 1983 until his retirement in 2015. Because of his service \non active duty, Applicant became eligible for an early ANG retirement in June 2019 and \nreceives approximately $4,093 per month. (Items 7, 10) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s eight delinquent SOR debts, totaling approximately $68,644, are \nestablished by his June 4, 2021 SF-86; his February 4, 2020 and July 13, 2021 OPM \ninterviews; his October 5, 2021 DOHA Interrogatory responses; his July 2, 2021, March \n9, 2022, and September 19, 2022 credit reports; his child support/divorce records; and \nhis undated SOR Answer. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h; Items 1-10) In his SOR Answer, \nApplicant admitted each allegation. \nAlthough not his largest debt, Applicant\u2019s $10,000 child support arrearage in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h presents as the most troubling. In February 2013, Applicant\u2019s former spouse\nobtained a $7,651 child support judgment of delinquency against him. (Item 8) By June\n4, 2021, the size of the arrearage had increased to at least $10,000. (Item 3) In his SF-\n86, Applicant described this debt as alimony, and he later explained in his February 4,\n2020 OPM interview that this debt was actually for child support. (Item 10) He added\nduring that interview that he owed about $17,000 in back child support and\nacknowledged that he had not made any payments since the 2015 to 2016 timeframe.\n(Item 10) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his October 5, 2021 DOHA interrogatory responses, Applicant stated that he \nhad about $94,000 in debt and attributed periods of unemployment after leaving active \nduty in late 2014 for his financial situation. (Item 7) He also admitted that he had not \npaid any of the nine debts listed in the Interrogatory, nor had he made payment \narrangements or made any payments. (Item 7) Eight of those debts are listed on his \nSOR. (Items 1, 7) \nAs the above summary indicates, Applicant has incurred a substantial amount of \nunresolved debt. Furthermore, he did not submit evidence that he resolved any of these \ndebts, that he remained in contact with his creditors during his periods of delinquency, \nor that he received financial counseling. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \n\u00b6\u00b6eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nmaintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that \narticulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApart from AG \u00b6 20(b), none of the mitigating conditions apply. However, full \ncredit under that mitigating condition is not warranted given the fact that Applicant failed \nto act responsibly and neglected to remain in contact with his creditors during his \nperiods of unemployment. The evidence does not support application of any of the other \npotential mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing, and he \nhas not established that his debts are being resolved or are under control. Nor did he \ndocument that any of the SOR debts are not his responsibility. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nmajority of his adult life, is receiving military retirement pay, and is presumed to be a \nmature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information suggesting that his \nlong-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts remain about his \nsuitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he did not \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. He failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding his past efforts to address his outstanding delinquent debt. Because he failed \nto provide such information and relied on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to fully \nestablish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 59 years old. In 1982, he enlisted in the U.S. Army National Guard. He received an honorable discharge at the rank of private first class (PFC) in 1991. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1999. He has never married and does not have any children. From 2010 to February 2016, he was employed as a contract truck driver with another co-driver, his roommate as well as the owner and operator of the truck. They hauled classified cargo for a government contractor. Applicant\u2019s DOD security clearance was issued in 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 37-38) The co-driver appeared at the hearing and testified as a witness for Applicant. He stated that beginning in February 2016, Applicant became unexpectedly unemployed after he (co-driver) suffered a serious medical issue and was unable to work for several months. Applicant was unemployed for about eight months, which seriously diminished his finances. After he (co-driver) recovered from his surgery, he moved out of the residence, accepted employment with another company, and no longer needed Applicant\u2019s services as a co-driver. This was another unanticipated event since Applicant thought he would resume working with him once he fully recovered. At that point, Applicant decided he would take any employment he could find since his debts were substantial and he no longer had a roommate to split housing expenses. He found employment for minimal pay at a poultry farm. His weekly net pay at the poultry farm was about $300 a ",

The case was assigned to me on August 19, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November \n1, 2022, setting the hearing for November 16, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6. Applicant and his witness testified, and he submitted documents I labeled as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A through M. I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without \nobjection. I held the record open for two weeks in the event either party wanted to \nsupplement the record with additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted five \npost-hearing documents, labeled as AE N-R. I admitted the documents into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 23, 2022, and \nthe record closed on December 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old. In 1982, he enlisted in the U.S. Army National Guard. He \nreceived an honorable discharge at the rank of private first class (PFC) in 1991. He \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in 1999. He has never married and does not have any \nchildren. From 2010 to February 2016, he was employed as a contract truck driver with \nanother co-driver, his roommate as well as the owner and operator of the truck. They \nhauled classified cargo for a government contractor. Applicant\u2019s DOD security clearance \nwas issued in 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 37-38) \nThe co-driver appeared at the hearing and testified as a witness for Applicant. He \nstated that beginning in February 2016, Applicant became unexpectedly unemployed \nafter he (co-driver) suffered a serious medical issue and was unable to work for several \nmonths. Applicant was unemployed for about eight months, which seriously diminished \nhis finances. After he (co-driver) recovered from his surgery, he moved out of the \nresidence, accepted employment with another company, and no longer needed \nApplicant\u2019s services as a co-driver. This was another unanticipated event since Applicant \nthought he would resume working with him once he fully recovered. At that point, \nApplicant decided he would take any employment he could find since his debts were \nsubstantial and he no longer had a roommate to split housing expenses. He found \nemployment for minimal pay at a poultry farm. His weekly net pay at the poultry farm was \nabout $300 a week, and his current weekly net pay as a co-driver is about $1,000 per \nweek. In May 2018, his former co-driver requested that they work together again hauling \nclassified cargo for their previous government contractor. Applicant accepted his offer. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $60,000.

(AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant is indebted to a finance company for a delinquent \naccount in the approximate amount of $14,197. He provided documentation that he \nauthorized monthly automatic electronic funds transfers from his bank account in the \namount of $1,000 to be paid to the creditor beginning in June 2022. This large debt was \nfor a new heating system he had installed in his home. He has made consistent monthly \npayments on this account. The November 2022 credit report verified this information by \nshowing the current balance as $11,280. He provided evidence that he made seven \n$1,000 payments to the creditor.

He allowed his savings to accumulate and \nhe maintained contact with his creditors. He stated that \u201che is working diligently to \ncompletely resolve [his] remaining debt.\u201d (AE K; Tr. 43-46) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s witness and co-driver had previously served with Applicant in the U.S, \nArmy National Guard for a brief period of time. He recommended that Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance be continued since he considered Applicant completely trustworthy. In addition, \nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from the government contractor\u2019s \nassistant facility security officer. She reported that Applicant had been previously \nemployed from October 2010 to May 2016. In May 2018, he was rehired without \nreservation. During his career, Applicant has safely transported classified cargo without \nincident. She considers Applicant to be an exemplary employee. (Tr. 30, 33-34; AE L) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports in the record, the Government \nestablished that Applicant has 13 delinquent accounts totaling about $35,000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.    \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017); See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies due to unemployment, loss of \nincome from his roommate, and underemployment. Notwithstanding these unforeseen \nevents that impacted his finances, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted responsibly \nin dealing with his financial issues under the circumstances. \nIt is well-established that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration \nin evaluating whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems.

See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nApplicant testified that he had paid other debts not alleged in the SOR, and in \n2020, he paid $5,000 towards the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He also put money into his \nsavings, and after receipt of the May 2022 SOR, he depleted his savings account to pay \noff several of the delinquent accounts. He denied that he only took action to resolve his \ndebts after he was placed on notice that his security clearance was in jeopardy. He has \nbeen communicating with his creditors and working diligently to resolve his financial \ndelinquencies well before the SOR was issued. He provided documentation to show he \nhas made seven consecutive $1,000 monthly payments to his largest SOR creditor for a \nheating system installed in his home. I find he has established a meaningful financial track \nrecord of payments to this creditor. It is his intention to continue working with his creditors \nuntil all of his delinquent accounts are paid. \nApplicant has fully resolved several delinquent SOR accounts and has greatly \nreduced his overall indebtedness. There is sufficient evidence that his financial problems \nare being resolved and are under control. Overall, I find that Applicant has demonstrated \nthat he acted responsibly to address his financial delinquencies. He provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues developed due to circumstances beyond his control. \nHe has acted responsibly to address and resolve his financial delinquencies. His efforts \nreflect good judgment and reliability, and he has greatly reduced his overall indebtedness. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nDespite his financial issues, his employer has seen his work ethic over the years and \nconsiders him to be an exemplary employee. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:  \nFOR Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated foreign influence concerns relating to his connections to Iraq. \nEligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 17, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the foreign influence guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 4, 2019.  \nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts \ncontained in 10 attachments related to the country of Iraq.

Administrative notice is \nappropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, \nAdministrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).

The elections were observed by the European Union and domestic \ncivil society organizations and monitored by the United Nations Assistance Mission or \nIraq. (id.) The 2021 elections were scheduled because of the widespread protests that \nbegan in October 2019 and led to the resignation of former prime minister Adil Abd al-\nMahdi in December 2019. Parliament, in turn, confirmed Prime Minister Mustafa al-\nKadhimi in May 2020. \nIn preparation for the 2021 national elections, Iraq adopted a new electoral law \nbased on individual candidacy and local districts. The 2021 election law was designed \nto create new political opportunities for independents and members and protest \nmovement that brought down the government formed after the 2018 election. See Iraq \nand U.S. Policy, (Congressional Research Service (May 2022). Whether the election \nresults and formation talks will reduce the formal influence of Iran-aligned groups who \nseek to revise or rescind Iraq\u2019s invitation to U.S. military advisors to remain in Iraq is \nunclear. \nFor historical perspective, in 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and \nsucceeded in removing Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and \npolitical power. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. \n2018); Background Note, Iraq, at 3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008). After two years of \noperations under a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in \nMarch 2006 (with the approval of the U.S. government), following free elections. (id) \nSince March 2006, the government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad \ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the \nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8. While elections \nhave been held and concluded, none of the key constituent groups have been able to \nform a government, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security \nthroughout the provinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile \npolitical environment in Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that \ncontinue to underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence.

See the World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. As a result of \nthe U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. The \nrebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand since \n2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity. \nProposed oil revenue-sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno\u00ad\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunni, and Kurds) still awaits passage after four years of \nstalled negotiations, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such \nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement of the Record, Worldwide \nThreat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence (Jan. 2019) For the foreseeable future, the national government can be \nexpected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law \nto strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector. \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to \ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would \nseem to validate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal \nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have \nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking \nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government \ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the \nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \n \nTerrorism and human rights issues \nDespite recent developments in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a \nvery dangerous, volatile, and unpredictable country.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nApplicant and his wife are naturalized U.S. citizens. Neither Applicant nor his wife \nhave any control (either individually or jointly with his siblings) over any property or \nfinancial interests in Iraq. Key to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers and seven sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nTerrorist attacks and human rights abuses have long plagued Iraq. Because Iraq \npresents some heightened security risks for applicants who have family and property \ninterests in the country, Applicant is exposed to civilian and military authorities in the \ncountry who might use improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information in \nApplicant\u2019s possession or control through his siblings (especially his older brother). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings and daughter are infrequent, they are \nlongstanding. And, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his or her \nimmediate family members, and this presumption covers in-laws (to include Applicant\u2019s \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nmother-in-law residing in Iraq).

Feb. 20, 2002) \nTo be sure, the risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if \nthe foreign country has an authoritarian government; the government ignores the rule of \nlaw (including widely accepted civil liberties); a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government; the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency; \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage; or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. With \nrespect to Iraq, the country is certainly not free from risks of potential hostage taking. \nIraq, though, maintains strong bilateral relations with the United States and recognizes \ndemocratic principles of governance. \nTaken together, the personal and financial relationships Applicant has with Iraq, \nand the situations that exist in this country, places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationship with any family member living in Iraq and \npension interest that Applicant has with the country (through his daughter as his \npension assignee) does not pose irreconcilable security risks. Such risks that cannot be \nreconciled or otherwise mitigated could potentially place him in a position of having to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq, or to take actions to protect his property interests (directly or indirectly) in \nIraq. \nFurther, while Applicant\u2019s residual interest in his Iraqi pension is small, the \npotential of a reversionary interest in his pension does present some potential for \nirreconcilable conflicts of interest. For these reasons, the Government urges security \nconcerns over risks that Applicant and his pension interest in Iraq might be subject to \nseizure or revision by civilian or military authorities in Iraq. His pension interest, \naccordingly, poses some risk of revision or confiscation by the government of Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties and residual pension interests, accordingly, warrant some \napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions of the foreign influence guideline DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.\u201d \nPotentially applicable, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation is \u00b6 7(f), \u201dsubstantial business, \nfinancial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign-operated business \nthat could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s reported $900 monthly pension currently \nassigned to his daughter in Iraq is potentially worth over $300,000 in discounted future \nbenefits.

These historical \nantecedents limit the risk of any potential conflict situation. And, while the absence of \nany past coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities does not completely absolve \nApplicant from any coercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history of \nterrorism and human rights abuses, the risks of any coercive measures being taken \nagainst his siblings and daughter should be considered minimal in making an overall \nrisk assessment. \nThis is not to discount the significance of the nature of the foreign government \n(Iraq in this case). Iraq\u2019s intelligence-gathering and human rights and the country\u2019s \ngovernment relations with the United States are among the most important \nconsiderations to be considered when assessing risks associated with an applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties and property interests in that country. See ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 \n(May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. March 13, 2017) Iraq to \nits credit has maintained good bilateral relations with the United States. While the recent \nreports of attacks and counterattacks on Iraqi targets raise concerns over the future of \nthe U.S. presence in the country in the wake of Iraq\u2019s being drawn into the still unfolding \nmilitary recriminations from the U.S. drone strikes on Soleimani on Iraqi soil, to date the \nstatus of the United States presence and role in Iraq has not been reversed or changed \nin any manifest way. \nMitigation is available to Applicant under the foreign influence guideline of the \nDirective. Based on his case-specific circumstances, mitigating conditions (MC) \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons \nare located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it \nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe United States\u201d; and 8(b),\u201dthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nThe citizenship and resident status of Applicant\u2019s siblings, mother-in-law, and \ndaughter in Iraq, and the pension benefits assigned to his daughter in Iraq, considered \ntogether, create no more than remote risks of a conflict situation that could place \nApplicant in a position that could force him to choose between his personal interests \nand the security interests of the United States. Given the substantia family ties that \nApplicant and his wife enjoy in the United States, any potential conflicts that Applicant \ncould potentially face with his siblings and daughter in Iraq, promise to be minor and \nreconcilable with Applicant\u2019s long demonstrated loyalty to the United States and \nconsiderable and longstanding family interests in this country. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther mitigating conditions available to Applicant are \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d and 8(f), \u201cthe \nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such \nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, he has demonstrated \ninfrequent contact with his siblings and daughter in Iraq. And, the residual pension \ninterests he potentially retains in his daughter\u2019s pension assignment in Iraq is relatively \nsmall and unlikely to ever materialize in applicant\u2019s lifetime. \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his siblings and daughter living in Iraq are less \nsignificant than his connections to his family members in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \npast support of the U.S. Government as an engineer and linguist for the U.S. State \nDepartment assisting the Iraqi government in Operation Iraqi Freedom are important \nfactors in weighing the merits of mitigating foreign influence-based security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s substantial connections to the United States when considered together with \nhis foreign connections are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain \nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance takes account of the.citizenship status of Applicant, his spouse, his siblings, \nand his daughter, all of whom are either citizens and residents of Iraq or dual citizens of \nIraq and the United States (as with Applicant and his wife). Applicant is a 62-year-old \nlinguist and engineer by training for a defense contractor with seven siblings and a \ndaughter who are citizens and residents of Iraq. While he has a potential residual \ninterest in his Iraq military pension (currently assigned to his daughter), the interest is at \nmost an inchoate interest unlikely to ever materialize. Applicant maintains infrequent \ncontact with his siblings, mother-in-law and daughter in Iraq and provides no financial \nsupport to any of his family members living in the country. \nBased on the evidence presented, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s relatives \nresiding in Iraq have any ties or connections to Iraq (except for Applicant\u2019s older brother \nand brothers-in-law of several of his sisters with military service in Iraq) Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable service to the United States . as a linguist and engineer during the Operation \nIraqi Freedom campaign t is well noted and a good indicator of his loyalties to the \nUnited States. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers Iraq that still present some heightened risks despite the \ncountry\u2019s strong bilateral relationships with the United States. Terrorists continue to \nthreaten the interests of the United States in Iraq and can be expected to do so in the \nforeseeable future. Through all of this, Iraq still remains a reliable partner in the war on \n13 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nterror in the Middle East, and can be expected to fully comply with the rule of law as an \nimportant ally of the United States. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Since June 2014 he has worked as a technician for a Federal contractor. He was granted a security clearance in about 2012. He is seeking to retain his clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 24- 26; GE 1 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.) Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended with delinquent debts and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR identified 27 charged-off debts or debts in collection owed by Applicant totaling about $49,000. The Government also alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in about November 2008 and his debts were discharged in March 2009. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional explanations regarding his wife\u2019s 2018 diagnosis with cancer and years of medical expenses. The existence and amounts of these debts is also supported by credit reports in the record dated January 29, 2020; November 3, 2021; and May 31, 2022, and Applicant\u2019s disclosures in the e- QIP.

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing \non November 3, 2022, scheduling the hearing for November 30, 2022. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered seven exhibits marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \noffered four exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were also \nadmitted without objection. Applicant and his wife testified. I kept the record open until \nJanuary 23, 2023, to give Applicant the opportunity to supplement the record. On \nDecember 30, 2022, Applicant submitted eight documents, which I marked as AE E \nthrough L and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2022. (Tr. at 13-23, 62.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old, married, and has two minor children. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1989 and earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1992. Since June 2014 he has \nworked as a technician for a Federal contractor. He was granted a security clearance in \nabout 2012. He is seeking to retain his clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 24-\n26; GE 1 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is \nfinancially overextended with delinquent debts and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentified 27 charged-off debts or debts in collection owed by Applicant totaling about \n$49,000. The Government also alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nabout November 2008 and his debts were discharged in March 2009. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional explanations regarding his \nwife\u2019s 2018 diagnosis with cancer and years of medical expenses. The existence and \namounts of these debts is also supported by credit reports in the record dated January \n29, 2020; November 3, 2021; and May 31, 2022, and Applicant\u2019s disclosures in the e-\nQIP. (GE 3 to 5 and 7.) \nThe background and current status of each of the debts alleged in the SOR is as \nfollows: \n1.a. 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant and his wife faced financial hardship \nwhen she was laid off from her job as a social worker during her pregnancy with their \nsecond child. She was bedridden with a high-risk pregnancy, and her employer of 20 \nyears terminated her during the pregnancy. Applicant was also unemployed or \nunderemployed with seasonal jobs for a lengthy period of time. They lost their house to \nthe mortgage lender and their accumulated debts were discharged in bankruptcy.

His repayment \nobligation was deferred for several years before going into collection. He has applied for \ndebt forgiveness under a Federal policy that is presently being addressed in the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. No payments are currently due following the Federal COVID-\nrelated \u201cpause\u201d policy on the repayment of student loans. Applicant understands that if \nthe debt-relief program is determined to be legal, most of his student loan debt will be \nforgiven. Once the litigation is resolved and he knows how much he has to pay, he intends \nto begin making monthly payments. This debt is not delinquent at this time. I take \nadministrative notice of the fact under Federal student loan policy, Applicant\u2019s future \npayments when they must commence will be based upon an income-driven repayment \nplan that takes into consideration Applicant\u2019s income, family size, and ability to repay the \nloan at affordable monthly rates. See www.Studentaid.gov. (Tr. at 34-38; AE F.) \n1.c. through 1.p. Medical debts in collection in the amounts ranging from $76 to \n$5,214, totaling approximately $14,600. Applicant has medical insurance for himself and \nhis family through his employer. The payments alleged in the SOR are co-pays on each \nof the bills for medical services for his wife and child. After the hearing, Applicant made a \n$3,000 payment that resolved ten of the medical debts in full. He also entered into a \npayment plan to address the remaining medical debts held by this collection agency. The \nplan requires payments of $194.74 per month for 36 months for a total amount of about \n$7,000. Applicant\u2019s first payment was made in early February 2023. These debts are \nbeing resolved. (Tr. at 39-42; AE G.) \n1.q. Store credit account in collection for approximately $1,906. Prior to the \nhearing, Applicant\u2019s wife was in discussions with this creditor to work out a settlement of \nthis debt. After the hearing, Applicant provided a document evidencing his settlement of \nthis debt with a payment of $953 in full resolution of the debt. The exhibit reflects that the \naccount has a zero balance. This debt is resolved.

See discussion of debts 1.c through 1.p, above. \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant submitted three character-reference letters, one from a long-time friend \nof Applicant\u2019s, a second from a therapist who has known Applicant personally and \nprofessionally for over 22 years, and a third from another close friend. All of his references \npraise Applicant\u2019s dedication to his work and his family. They describe him as a \ntrustworthy person with strong religious values and integrity. (AE B through C.). \nApplicant loves his job and asserts that he does it well. The income he earns \nsupports his wife and two children. He is determined to repay his debts that arose in 2018 \nfollowing his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis and treatment, which included surgery, \nchemotherapy, and radiation. His wife\u2019s treatment and medical bills continue up to the \npresent. She is currently in remission, but she gets tested every three months. She still \nsees the same doctors that make up part of the medical bills listed in the SOR. She was \nunable to work for a lengthy period and given her present condition is able to only work \nparttime as a caregiver. \nThey also had medical bills arising from complications in one of his children\u2019s \nmedical condition. The child was born prematurely with medical problems. As a teenager, \nthe child continues to have issues with depression and anxiety, which require ongoing \ntreatment. For the last six or seven years, the child has also been seeing the same doctors \nthat are owed money. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that the doctors are willing to work with \nthem on a payment plan for the past-due accounts. She is current on the co-pays owed \nto the family\u2019s doctors. Applicant asserted that he is a man of his word and he intends to \nfulfill his promises and address all of his debts.

He and his wife have not received \nany financial counseling to help them with their planning or their negotiations with their \ncreditors. He testified that they intend to seek financial counseling to help them. His wife \ntestified that they are current on all of their monthly bills. (Tr. at 46-50, 61.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed approximately $47,000 for 27 \nalleged delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and the credit reports in \nthe record establish the existence of these debts and the application of the above \npotentially disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his financial history. \nThe guideline includes the following three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant has faced unusual circumstances unlikely to recur \nthat arose for reasons largely beyond his control. He went through a bankruptcy in 2008 \ndue to the loss of his employment and his wife\u2019s employer of 20 years terminating her \ndue to her disability while experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. At the same time, Applicant \nwas unemployed or underemployed, and the couple was unable to maintain their family \nhome and pay their bills. Ten years later, Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with cancer and \nno longer able to work. Applicant was employed at this time, but as the sole income \nprovider for the family, he was unable to pay all of his wife\u2019s numerous medical bills, repay \nhis student loans, and provide housing and the needs of his family of four. In addition, \none of Applicant\u2019s children, who was born prematurely in 2009, has experienced ongoing \nmedical issues, and Applicant has incurred additional and ongoing medical expenses for \nthe child\u2019s care since birth. \nApplicant has acted responsibly when faced with the potential loss of his \nemployment and medical insurance for his family. He has borrowed money from his 401K \naccount that he had hoped to protect for his retirement, and he used a portion of those \nfunds to pay several of his debts. Significantly, he made a lump-sum payment of $3,000 \non a number of his delinquent medical accounts and has entered into a payment plan to \npay an additional $7,000 with monthly payments over the next 36 months. Lastly, he has \napplied for a reduction of his student loan debt that if finally approved by the Supreme \nCourt would largely forgive most of his student loan debt. In the event that the forgiveness \nplan is not approved by the Court, Applicant will begin repaying his student loans later \nthis year pursuant to an income-driven repayment plan that will keep his monthly payment \nobligation to a level within his means. Applicant\u2019s present financial circumstances and \nactions do not cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. All of the \nabove-quoted mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concern. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight \nto the extraordinary circumstances that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s medical debts, past \nstudent loan delinquencies, and bankruptcy. I have also weighed the fact that Applicant\u2019s \nlist of debts in the SOR contain very few consumer debts. This is impressive evidence of \nresponsibility in his control of his expenses during financially difficult times. I have also \nconsidered the timing of Applicant\u2019s remedial steps with respect to settling the medical \ndebts and the small consumer debts. Applicant\u2019s reluctance to borrow from his retirement \naccount until it became obvious that it was necessary for him to do so is understandable \nand represents a conservative approach to his financial planning. The fact that in the end \nhe took that necessary step to address his delinquent debts reflects responsible actions \ntaken to protect his security clearance eligibility and employment. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.dd:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Additionally, I find that AE F accurately reflects withdrawals from Applicant\u2019s bank account to the IRS from June 2018 through May 2023 (addressed further below). Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked since 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1978 until he was honorably discharged in 1987. He then served in the Air National Guard from 1987 to 2001. He was in the Inactive Reserve until he entered the retired rolls of the Air Force in 2020. He attended college for a period, but he has not earned a degree. He is twice divorced. He married his current wife in 2015. He has six children and three stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24, 52-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B, G) 2 Applicant has a history of financial problems and tax issues, going back to at least 2003. He attributed his financial issues primarily to his daughter who was born in 2003 with significant medical problems. His insurance did not cover all her expenses, and he had to pay a large amount out of pocket. Her condition is permanent and will require medical care throughout her life. He prioritized his daughter and worked multiple jobs, but he was unable to pay all his bills and taxes. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005, and his dischargeable debts were discharged the same year. (Tr. at 17, 29-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE ",

There was no objection to AE E, and it was admitted in \nevidence. \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admission of AE F on the basis of \nauthenticity and the lack of a verifiable source of the documents. Department Counsel \nalso commented on the weight of the documents if the objection is overruled. \nApplicant was provided an opportunity after Department Counsel\u2019s objection to \nsubmit additional matter. He submitted an email, which I marked AE G and admitted in \nevidence without objection. \nAE F consists of excerpts of Applicant\u2019s bank account statements from June \n2018 through May 2023. He stated that the actual bank statements are 268 pages, and \nhe felt that it was unnecessary to send the full statements, which would have contained \nmuch irrelevant information. The excerpts purportedly show, with several months \nmissing, $700 monthly electronic payments to the IRS. I have considered all the \nevidence in this case, including Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and IRS tax transcripts \nfrom 2013 through 2021. The tax transcripts show that an installment agreement was \nestablished on February 27, 2018. Regular payments in accordance with the installment \nagreement do not appear on the 2013 tax transcript until December 2021, but I believe \nthat is because payments were going to pay taxes for previous tax years. Tax \ntranscripts for earlier tax years are not in the record, but tax transcripts for 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 report that the IRS withheld what would have been refunds \nfor those years and transferred them to pay back taxes for 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008. \nThe payments reflected on the 2013 and 2014 tax transcripts perfectly align with the \nwithdrawals in the offered exhibit. \nThe objection to AE F is overruled, and it is admitted in evidence. Department \nCounsel\u2019s email objecting to the document is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s comments on the weight of the documents are treated as \nargument. \nFindings of Fact \nI adopt any facts addressed in the above evidentiary discussion as a finding of \nfact. Additionally, I find that AE F accurately reflects withdrawals from Applicant\u2019s bank \naccount to the IRS from June 2018 through May 2023 (addressed further below). \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has \nworked since 2021.

(Tr. at 17, \n29-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 7) \nApplicant owed federal taxes for tax years 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013, and \n2014. In 2014, the IRS withheld $2,305 from what would have been a refund for tax \nyear 2013 and applied it to his 2003 taxes. However, the IRS later assessed additional \ntaxes, penalties, and interest for 2013 (discussed below). His 2003 taxes were paid in \n2015 when $6,180 was withheld from what would have been a refund for tax year 2014 \nand was applied to his 2003 taxes. The IRS withheld $2,132 from what would have \nbeen that same refund and applied it to his 2006 taxes. The IRS later assessed \nadditional taxes and interest for 2014 (discussed below). (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 7; AE D) \nIn 2016, the IRS withheld $930 from what would have been a refund for tax year \n2015 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. In 2018, the IRS withheld $416 from what would \nhave been a refund for tax year 2017 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. His 2006 taxes \nwere paid in 2019 when $1,715 was withheld from what would have been a refund for \ntax year 2018 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. In 2019, the IRS withheld $416 from \nwhat would have been the same refund and applied it to his 2008 taxes.

(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D) \nIn his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in \nFebruary 2015, Applicant reported his financial problems and tax issues. He reported \nthat he owed $47,000 to the IRS at one time. He wrote that he had worked multiple jobs \nto pay off his debts. He stated that his debt to the IRS was almost paid off. (GE 2) \nApplicant had additional tax issues after he submitted the SF 86. He filed an \nextension for tax year 2013, which extended the due date until October 15, 2014. \nHowever, he did not file his federal income tax return for that year until February 2015. \nIn June 2016, the IRS assessed $9,376 in additional tax. With penalties and interest, \nthe balance rose to more than $14,000. (Tr. at 35-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n7; AE D) \nApplicant established an installment plan with the IRS in February 2018 to pay \n$700 per month by automatic withdrawal from his bank account.

(Tr. at 19-21, 37-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 7; AE D-F) \nBecause Applicant owed the IRS for previous tax years, regular payments \nthrough the installment agreement did not begin for tax year 2013 until December 2021. \nThe IRS also reported a $1,400 payment in December 2019. In April 2022, the IRS \nwithheld what would have been his refund for tax year 2021 and transferred $5,856 to \nhis tax debt for 2013.

In March 2015, the IRS withheld what would have been his refund for tax year \n2014 and transferred $6,180 to his tax debt for 2003. However, in February 2017, the \nIRS assessed $4,620 in additional taxes. The IRS added $1,455 interest and $1,064 \npenalties, including $25 for the dishonored payment in April 2023. As of September \n2022, he owed $6,827 in taxes, interest, and penalties. The balance was reduced to \n$6,139 as of May 2023. Applicant testified, as supported by an IRS document that I \nviewed over the computer screen but was not offered into evidence, that the balance for \n2014 was down to $5,237. There are no taxes owed for any other tax year. (Tr. at 16, \n41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D-G) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2015 in September 2016. \nSince there is no indication that he requested an extension, the return was filed late.\nWhat would have been a refund of $930 was transferred to his 2006 taxes.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file all his federal income tax returns when they were due, and \nhe failed to pay his 2013 and 2014 federal income taxes when they were due. AG \u00b6 \n19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and tax issues, going back at least \nto 2003 when his daughter was born with a significant and permanent medical \ncondition. He worked multiple jobs but was unable to pay all his bills and taxes. He filed \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005 and his dischargeable debts were discharged the \nsame year. Medical costs and tax issues continued after the bankruptcy. \nApplicant owed additional federal taxes for 2013 and 2014 when the IRS \nassessed almost $14,000 in additional taxes. Penalties and interest brought the total \nowed for those two years to about $21,000. Additionally, he still owed for tax years \n2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008. He established an installment plan with the IRS in \nFebruary 2018 to pay $700 per month by automatic withdrawal from his bank account \nfor all his back taxes. He missed five payments, likely because there was not enough in \nhis bank account, but he made 56 payments over the course of 61 months, about \n$39,200. Additionally, between 2014 and 2021, the IRS withheld more than $30,000 \nfrom what would have been refunds and transferred the money to pay his back taxes. \nHis tax liability is now down to less than $6,000. \nApplicant was not as diligent as he should have been about ensuring that his \nfederal income tax returns were filed on time and his taxes paid. However, all the \nreturns have been filed, and Applicant made arrangements with the IRS to pay his back \ntaxes and he is in substantial compliance with those arrangements. AG \u00b6 20(g) is \napplicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nI found Applicant to be honest and truthful. I am convinced that he has learned a \nvaluable and costly lesson, that he will continue with the installment plan until his back \ntaxes are paid, and that all future returns and taxes will be filed and paid on time. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01624 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2022), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s denial of a security clearance where the applicant initiated a \nrepayment plan with the IRS three years before he completed the security clearance \napplication and four years before issuance of the SOR; he had been in compliance with \nthe plan for seven years; and he had paid off approximately 33% of the aggregate debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

During \nthat background interview, Applicant discussed her delinquent debts, including taxes. She \ndiscussed her Federal and state income tax returns. She told the investigator that she did \nnot file her 2016 and 2017 tax returns because she had not received a W-2 Form. She \nwas uncertain of the amount she owed for 2016. As of the date of the interview, she had \nnot filed those returns. (Item 8) \nIn her September 2022 Answer to the SOR, Applicant repeatedly stated that her \ninability to pay her delinquent debts was due to periods of unemployment, being a single \nmother, having no health insurance, and suffering from medical disabilities.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns. Three may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2013 and discharged about $27,000 of delinquent debt. Since then, she has accumulated \nabout $34,000 of delinquent debts, which she has been unable to resolve. She also failed \nto file Federal and state income tax returns for 2016. The evidence raises the above \nsecurity concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate \nthose concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been outstanding since 2014 and \ncontinue to be unresolved, which casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to numerous periods of \nunemployment and her medical disabilities. Those were circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. She did not provide evidence to demonstrate that she \nattempted to responsibly manage her debts as they were accumulating, or address them \nuntil receiving the SOR more than three years after starting her current job. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. \nApplicant provided evidence that she participated in financial counseling when she \nentered into a payment plan in August 2022. She submitted a budget that confirms she \nearns a high salary. However, there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude there \nare clear indications that her delinquent debts are coming under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \nminimally applies. She submitted documentation that she made an effort to establish a \nplan to resolve her debts, but she did not provide evidence that she made any payments \ninto the plan, despite being notified of an opportunity to do so after she received the \nFORM in November 2022. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. There is no evidence that she has \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n    \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n \n                      Subparagraphs: 1.p and 1.q:                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntaken steps to resolve her outstanding Federal and state income tax returns for 2016 and \n2017. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts and circumstances surrounding \nthis case. Based on the limited evidence and the lack of an established track record of \nresponsible financial management, Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under the guideline for financial considerations. Continuation of \nher financial issues is likely, and the potential for coercion or duress remains \nundiminished. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.o: \nWithdrawn \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n                                     \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Sometime in 2018 or 2019, \nshe retained the services of a tax preparer service (TPS) to file her Federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019; however, she did file them until 2022. See \nbelow. The TPS determined that she owed approximately $1,300 to the IRS. She did \nnot pay any delinquent taxes owed at that time relying on her TPS to negotiate a \nreduced balance. She fired that TPS because they were not effective in negotiating any \ntype of settlement or payment plan with the IRS or her state tax authority.

The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. Her debt, \nparticularly as it pertains to her delinquent taxes, remains a \u201ccontinuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nApplicant is able to receive partial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g), but does \nnot receive full credit under either of these two mitigating conditions because of her \nfailure to act responsibly under the circumstances and the time elapsed before \naddressing these obligations. Applicant has made some progress towards her paying \nher delinquent taxes. Of concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file her Federal \nand state income tax returns and pay her taxes owed as required. She did not offer a \nplausible explanation for failing to do so. Her motivation to address her taxes only \nbecame a priority after her clearance became an issue. The remaining mitigating \nconditions are not applicable. \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that her failure to file these returns and her \ndebts were a concern to the Government during her April 23, 2021 OPM PSI and later \nwhen she received her August 3, 2022 SOR. These events apparently did not prompt \nApplicant to recognize the seriousness of her situation and take immediate corrective \naction given Applicant\u2019s age, education, and experience. The evidence of record does \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nnot mitigate such a lapse in judgment. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did \nnot act responsibly with regard to timely filing her Federal and state income tax returns \nand paying or making payment arrangements for taxes owed. \nIn regard to the failure to file timely Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.\n15, 2016): \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). (emphasis in original) \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g are not mitigated.  \nForeign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of the Philippines. Department \nCounsel did not offer a country summary identifying country-specific concerns. Given \nthe history of the positive relationship that exists between the United States and the \nPhilippines, especially since World War II, the heightened-risk element is minimally \nsatisfied. That said, the Government established its case under Guideline B as a result \nof Applicant\u2019s contact with her niece who manages her modest real property holdings in \nthe Philippines. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position or having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \nThe Philippines\u2019s relationship with the United States, and the minimum \nheightened risk it presents, place a less than heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the \nsecurity concern. Applicant self-reported her Philippine connections and discussed them \nfreely. She appears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful information regarding \nthose connections throughout the security clearance process. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to the Philippines via her niece \nand the modest property she manages for Applicant in the Philippines. Applicant has \nspent the majority of her adult life in the United States. She became a U.S. citizen in a \nrelatively short time after immigrating to the United States in 1982. She has spent the \nmajority of her adult life in the United States. Her five siblings all reside in the United \nStates and are naturalized U.S. citizens. More importantly, her two biological adult sons \nare U.S.-born citizens and reside in the United States. Applicant maintains contact with \nall of her siblings and sons in varying degrees. Her fianc\u00e9 is a U.S.-born citizen with \nwhom she cohabitates. Although the family ties to the Philippines continue to be \nrelevant security considerations and cannot be dismissed out of hand, the strength of \nthose ties are diminished given the facts and circumstances here. On balance, her ties \nto the United States are far stronger than the family ties to the Philippines. \nGiven the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Philippines. I further conclude there is no conflict \nof interest because Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships \nand loyalties in the United States that she can be expected to resolve any potential \nconflict of interest in the favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nConclusion \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988), and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for this employer for over two years. She experienced periods of unemployment from December 2020 to June 2021; from February 2018 to April 2018; and from July 2013 to December 2013. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and has taken some courses toward a master\u2019s. She is single, never married, and has no children. This is her first application for a position of trust. (Tr. at 6, 37; 40-41; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant accumulated 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $38,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). The delinquent debts included two student loans, two car-repossession deficiencies, three medical debts, and four credit card or consumer debts. The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to a background investigator in August 2021; credit reports from June 2021, January 2022, and September 2023; and her admissions in her SOR answer. (GE 2-5; SOR answer) Applicant testified that she was financially illiterate growing up. Even when she entered college and began taking out student loans, she remained financially unsophisticated. Consequently, she agreed to cosign a car loan for her mother and took out credit cards without realizing the impact these actions would have on her overal",

The record remained \nopen and Applicant timely submitted exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. Her admissions \nare incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nthis employer for over two years. She experienced periods of unemployment from \nDecember 2020 to June 2021; from February 2018 to April 2018; and from July 2013 to \nDecember 2013. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and has taken some courses toward a \nmaster\u2019s. She is single, never married, and has no children. This is her first application \nfor a position of trust. (Tr. at 6, 37; 40-41; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant accumulated 11 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $38,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). The delinquent debts included two student \nloans, two car-repossession deficiencies, three medical debts, and four credit card or \nconsumer debts. The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to a background \ninvestigator in August 2021; credit reports from June 2021, January 2022, and \nSeptember 2023; and her admissions in her SOR answer. (GE 2-5; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that she was financially illiterate growing up. Even when she \nentered college and began taking out student loans, she remained financially \nunsophisticated. Consequently, she agreed to cosign a car loan for her mother and took \nout credit cards without realizing the impact these actions would have on her overall \nfinancial wellbeing. She has dealt with family issues including the death of her father \nand her brother\u2019s shooting. She indicated that with the exception of two medical debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j), she has not made any payments on the rest of the SOR debts. (Tr. 19, \n44) \nConcerning her student loans, Applicant gave conflicting information about \nwhether they were forgiven. During her background interview with an investigator in \nAugust 2021, which she authenticated in July 2022, she admitted having multiple \nfederal student loans for which she failed to make any payments. She admitted these \nloans became delinquent, but she could not recall when that was. She claimed that she \napplied for a loan forgiveness program, qualified for the program, and the student loans \nwere then forgiven. She did not provide any documentation to corroborate this action. \n(GE 2) The SOR student-loan debt appears on her June 2021 credit report with the \nfollowing information: \nDate Reported: 06/21; Date Assigned: 09/06; Activity Date: 06/21; \nBalance Date: 06/21; Narrative 1: Acct 120 days past due; Narrative 4: \nCharged-off Acct.

Applicant also admitted that \nshe has never made student loan payments. It appears Applicant\u2019s current student-loan \npayment status may be the result of President Biden\u2019s action pausing the collection of \nstudent loans due to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan \npayments. (Tr. 23, 27, 44; GE 2-5) \nApplicant testified that she planned to work with a credit repair agent or company \nto deal with her delinquent debts. She has looked into doing so, but as of the hearing, \nshe had not contacted any person or group yet. She also will look into loan forgiveness \nconcerning her student loans. Once she completes making her car payments of $450 \nmonthly (no payoff date stated), she will use those funds to pay her delinquent debts. \nShe provided a copy of her monthly budget that shows she has a monthly remainder of \napproximately $700 after paying all bills. She documented making payments for the two \nmedical debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j. Those two debts are resolved. She has not \nreceived financial counseling or otherwise enhanced her knowledge of financial issues. \n(Tr. 23, 31, 35-37, 42, 44-45; AE A-C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $38,000. With \nthe exception of paying two small medical debts, she failed to address the remaining \ndebts. I find all disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nstudent-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021)) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Except for two small medical debts, Applicant has \nnot documented payment towards any other SOR debts. While periods of \nunemployment and her family issues were circumstances beyond her control, she has \nnot shown responsible action toward addressing her delinquent debts. She failed to \nmake any student loan payments or address her other debts. None of the above \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances. However, she has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of financial responsibility, which causes me to \nquestion her ability to resolve her debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.h, 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.i \u2013 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He stated he never illegally purchased \nmarijuana but understood it was an illegal controlled substance under Federal law. (Tr. at \n16, 21.) He admitted using marijuana in a social setting one or two times after receiving \nthe SOR. His last use was about month before the hearing. He felt the security clearance \napplication process was \u201cextremely slow\u201d and the project he would have used a security \nclearance for had been completed so he used marijuana. He acknowledged this was not \nan excuse. (Tr. at 18, 21, 23, 27.) He listed on his SF 86 as references, persons with \nwhom he used marijuana socially. (Tr. at 29.) \nApplicant testified he had been told by work colleagues, who also used marijuana \nand held DoD security clearances, that if he was truthful, he would not have a problem. \n(Tr. at 30-31.) When asked to divulge the people smoking marijuana while holding a DoD \nsecurity clearance, he declined to answer the question. (Tr. at 32.) He added that since \nhe did not have a security clearance, he would not report them. (Tr. at 36.) Any derogatory \ninformation that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant admitted he used marijuana, purchased marijuana, and expressed an \nintent to continue to use marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(f) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates \n4 \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant knew throughout the periods of time \nalleged that his use and purchasing of marijuana was prohibited under Federal law. He \ncontinued to purchase and use marijuana after applying for a security clearance and after \nbeing placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security \nclearance. He continued to associate with others who use marijuana. In doing so, \nApplicant not only knowingly violated Federal drug laws but also disregarded security \nclearance eligibility standards. This behavior raises substantial questions about \nApplicant's judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Applicant's \nwillingness to sign a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future does not \nmitigate the scope of these security concerns. Nor does the passage of a little over a \nmonth between his last use of marijuana and the hearing eliminate those concerns. None \nof the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

(Item 3.) \nFrom September 2009 to May 2013, he went to college in State A, where he earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. From November 2013 to August 2019, he held a number of jobs in \nState A.

(Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations. (Item 2.) In his SCA, he elaborated on his marijuana use. He \u201csmoked \nmarijuana in college\u2026[took] edibles rarely over the last couple years\u2026[maybe] once \nevery couple weeks.\u201d Marijuana is currently legal in State B. If marijuana is legal in State \nA, he \u201cmay use it in the future in a social setting.\u201d (Item 3.) \nIn his July 27, 2022 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant further explained \nhis marijuana use and his intentions for future use. He confirmed the approximate dates \nof his past marijuana use. His statements in the PSI about future use, however, are \ninconsistent. On the one hand, he said he stopped using marijuana in July 2021, when \nhe returned to State A, where marijuana is illegal. On the other hand, he said he intends \nto use marijuana in the future because it is legal in State A and State B. In his response \nto an interrogatory, he said his intent is to use \u201coccasionally if legal in location.\u201d In \nresponse to the query \u201cdo you intend to use marijuana . . . in the future,\u201d he checked the \nanswer \u201cNo.\u201d (Item 4.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.

AG \u00b6 24 sets \nforth the concern in more detail below: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance. \nApplicant admitted that he purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from March 2011 to June 2021.

The knowing or intentional \npossession and use of any such substance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment, \na fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of \nNational Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is a security concern. James R. \nClapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: Adherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting \nMarijuana \nUse \n(October \n25, \n2014). \nSee \nalso \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. LSD and cocaine are Schedule I and Schedule II \ncontrolled substances, respectively, under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n811 et seq. See http://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nIn this case, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. Applicant is under \nthe misapprehension that state law governs the legality of marijuana purchase and use. \nThat is incorrect. Marijuana purchase and use continue to raise national security concerns \nunder federal law that must be mitigated. His conflicting statements in his PSI sow doubts \nabout his intention to use marijuana in the future. \nOnly mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) potentially applies here. That condition states: \n\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d It is true that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana \nbegan quite some time ago, in March 2011 while he was in college. His use, however, \ncontinued with varying frequency until June 2021, just a month after he completed his \nSCA. A two-year period of abstinence, especially in light of his equivocal future intent, is \ninsufficient to allay national security concerns. On these facts, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n26(a) does not apply. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I have also carefully considered the other mitigating \nconditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) through (d). On their face, those mitigating conditions \ndo not apply in this case. I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and \nability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. AG \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through (9) and 2(f)(1) through (6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant\nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

He is applying for the position of Aircraft Painter 3. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to seventeen separate creditors totaling $79,855, which consists of delinquent collection and charged-off accounts. In his answer, Applicant admits all of the allegations, except 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.o., and 1.q., which he contends he has paid off, settled, or made payments on. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 30, 2020; April 25, 2020; and August 8, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) Applicant explained that he fell behind on paying his bills due to his lack of knowledge on how to properly handle his finances with limited resources. He admits that he has been negligent. He was raised in a poverty-stricken area where the median household income is $22,000 annually. Applicant has been raising his two children and taking care of his grandmother. ",

(Tr. p. 55.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred excessive delinquent debt for a variety of reasons. At times, \nhe has lived beyond his means and spent money on extravagant things. Purchasing a \nCorvette for $80,000 when he was financially strapped was not a good decision. On \nother occasions, he may not have been earning enough money to cover his bills. As a \nresult, he incurred debt that he has not been able to pay. In addition, he states that he \nhas been the victim of discrimination that may have impacted his ability to pay his bills. \nAnd finally, it is not clear whether he has ignored his debt for many years, and focused \non other priorities in his life. In any event, his actions or inactions both demonstrated a \nhistory of not addressing his responsibility and an inability to pay his delinquent debt. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has made progress toward resolving his delinquent debts and he is \ncommended for these efforts. He has settled a number of his debts and resolved about \n$31,000. However, he remains delinquently indebted and currently owes in excess of \n$48,000, that he cannot show how he can pay. Not to mention his delinquent back rent \nof now $10,000 that will be due when his COVID restriction are lifted. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant has not demonstrated that he can live within his means and \ncomfortably pay his delinquent debts. \nApplicant does not meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried \nhis burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c, 1.d., \n1h., 1.i., and 1.n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n    \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.j., 1.k.,  \n 1.l., 1.m., 1.o., 1.p., and 1.q.\n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

In \nabout 2018, he stopped seeing his son\u2019s mother and obtained full custody of his son. \nAlthough he stopped seeing the friends with whom he used marijuana, he continued to \nregularly purchase and use marijuana through about April 2021. He stopped using \nmarijuana in order to pass an initial drug screening for his employer. (Tr. 30-32, 75-76) \nIn his May 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had purchased and used \nmarijuana \u201chundreds of times\u201d up until a month before his security clearance \napplication. However, he also stated his intent to terminate future marijuana use. (GX 1) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he was committed to not using marijuana in \nthe future. He described his personal growth, health and life changes as well as trying to \nbe a good father as reasons why he no longer intended to use marijuana. (Tr. 69-70, 77) \nMisuse of Prescription Medications \nIn about 2003, while working with the job program, Applicant experienced a \npainful medical condition and was given a prescription for Percocet. Later, he received \nVicodin at the hospital for a toothache. In both instances, he liked the way these \nnarcotics made him feel and described becoming addicted to them. (Tr. 46-49) \nAfter his prescriptions ran out, Applicant continued using Percocet or Vicodin \nweekly. He would illegally use these narcotics with his son\u2019s mother. She would either \nget them from the doctor\u2019s office where she worked, or she would purchase them from a \nfriend. Applicant would give her money to purchase the narcotics. (GX 1; Tr. 51-53) \nApplicant testified that he stopped using Percocet in 2018, primarily because it \nresulted in stomach issues. However, he continued taking Vicodin without a prescription \nthrough late 2020 or early 2021. He did not seek out any treatment or counseling to \nassist in terminating his use. However, he testified that he has no further intent to take \nnarcotics without a prescription because he was getting older and was trying to set a \ngood example for his son.

Knowing that he would \ntest positive for marijuana, Applicant called several friends in an effort to obtain clean \nurine to submit for the test. He then concealed the friend\u2019s urine in his jeans when he \nentered the testing facility. However, when he submitted the sample, the lab technician \nsuspected something was wrong and asked him to submit a second sample. He \nrefused, pretended to be sick and left the facility. His refusal was considered a failed \ndrug test by his employer and he was released from his assigned contract. (Tr. 59-68) \nAlthough Applicant disclosed details of this event in his Answer to the SOR and \nat hearing, he provided conflicting accounts during previous aspects of his investigation. \nIn both his SCA and background interview, he stated he did not know why he was \nrequested to submit a second urine sample. Yet, he knew the first sample was not his \nurine. He later claimed that he did not share details of his efforts to subvert the 2012 \ndrug test during the investigation because he forgot. (GX 1-2; Answer) \nApplicant acknowledged that his attempt to submit a false urine sample was a \n\u201chorrible idea\u201d that he would not repeat. However, he did resume using marijuana \nafterwards. (Tr. 78) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \n\u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school in 1999. He stopped using \nmarijuana in 2003 after failing a drug test and again in 2012 after he attempted to \nsubmit a false urine sample to a drug test and lost his job. However, besides those two \nbrief periods of abstinence, he regularly used marijuana through spring 2021. He also \nmisused prescription Percocet from 2003 through 2018 and prescription Vicodin from \n2003 through about 2020-2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.c. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in 2012 was initially alleged under Guideline H, SOR \u00b6 1.d \nwhich essentially stated that Applicant failed a drug test in 2012, when he refused to \ncomply with a request for a second urinalysis test after the first test proved inconclusive. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s urine was never tested in 2012. He explained in his Answer that \nwhat he really did was attempt to subvert the test by submitting someone else\u2019s urine as \nhis own sample. As a result, the Government amended the SOR to allege that conduct \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct. (See discussion below). While he was \nconsidered by his employer to have \u201cfailed the drug test\u201d since he did not complete it, in \nfact he did not actually test positive for an illegal drug. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25(b) is not \napplicable and the security concern alleged under SOR \u00b61.d has not been established \nunder Guideline H. (The security significance of his personal conduct is discussed \nunder Guideline E, below). \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse was both recent and \nfrequent. In 2021, he stopped using marijuana and misusing prescription narcotics in \norder to maintain his employment. He also no longer associates with several of the \npersons with whom he previously used drugs. He described several recent changes to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nhis environment and other circumstances that reflect positively on his ability to abstain \nfrom future drug use or misuse of prescription narcotics. Nevertheless, on two prior \noccasions, he stopped using marijuana for a brief period, only to eventually resume his \nuse. He has not yet established a sufficient pattern of abstinence to show that his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse are fully behind him. The circumstances and extent \nof Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use preclude application of either mitigation conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or (b). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 16 and the following is potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \nIn 2012, Applicant attempted to submit another person\u2019s urine sample for an \nemployer-directed drug test. In so doing, he attempted to conceal his drug use from his \nemployer and failed to follow rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s actions raise serious \nquestions of judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable. The \ngeneral security concern under AG \u00b6 15 also applies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nAt his hearing, Applicant described details of his efforts to subvert an employer-\ndirected drug test in 2012. His attempted submission of a false urine sample during the \ntest was not a minor offense. Further, he previously stated during his investigation that \nhe did not know why he was requested to submit a second urine sample. That was \nplainly not the case since he knew the first sample was not his urine. While significant \ntime has passed since this event, these subsequent conflicting statements about what \nhe did undercut his candor and credibility. This, coupled with the recency of his drug \nuse, continues to raise concerns regarding his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment \nand do not show sufficient changed circumstances to mitigate the personal conduct \nconcerns. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) or (d) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant regularly used marijuana and misused prescription narcotics for nearly \ntwenty years. In 2012, he attempted to conceal his drug use from his employer by \ndevising an elaborate scheme to submit someone else\u2019s urine for a drug test. Despite \nhis recognition that it was a \u201chorrible idea,\u201d he continued using marijuana and misusing \nprescription narcotics until 2021. Although he described several changed circumstances \nand his own maturation as factors in support of his efforts to remain drug free, the \nfrequency, recency and seriousness of his conduct leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline H and \nGuideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Department Counsel requested that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts regarding the Russian Federation (Russia). Department \nCounsel\u2019s request is not admitted in evidence, but I have taken administrative notice of \nthe facts contained therein, as summarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and she denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.k. She is 34 \nyears old, married, and has three minor children. She was born in Russia and \nimmigrated to the United States in 2008, at age 18, with her mother. She was educated \nin the United States, earning an associate degree in 2012, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014, \nand a Master of Business Administration degree in 2018. She has worked in financial \nmanagement for her employer, a DOD contractor, since April 2019. She has never held \na security clearance. (Items 1-2, 4, 15) \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Russia and the United States. She became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in March 2014. She was issued a Russian passport in \nDecember 2018, and it is not scheduled to expire until December 2023. She was issued \na U.S. passport in July 2020, and it is not scheduled to expire until July 2030. Her \nspouse, born in Mexico, is a citizen of Mexico and a permanent resident of the United \nStates. Their three children are native-born U.S. citizens residing with them. She and \nher spouse purchased their first home in the United States in February 2017. They sold \nit in July 2019 and purchased their current home. She does not have any financial \ninterests in Russia.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c) Her 59\u00ad\nyear-old father is a factory worker, and her 40-year-old stepmother does not work \noutside of the home. Two of her half-sisters, ages 11 and 9, are students, and her \nyoungest half-sister is 4 years old. She has weekly telephonic and electronic contact \nwith her father and stepmother and monthly electronic contact with her half-sisters. She \nsaw her family in Russia when she traveled there in 2008, 2009, and 2011. Her father \nand stepmother are aware that she is seeking a national security position. (Items 2, 4, \n15) \nApplicant used Western Union to send her father $3,500 between 2020 and \n2021, so that he could financially support his family. She stated in her Answer that she \npreviously sent her father quarterly financial support, and money for birthdays, holidays, \nand other special occasions.

She was \nmarried to a native-born U.S. citizen, Applicant\u2019s stepfather, who is recently deceased. \nShe has never worked in the United States. Applicant has daily to weekly in-person and \ntelephonic contact with her mother. While in Russia in 2017, Applicant\u2019s mother \nrenewed her Russian passport, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2027. Applicant\u2019s \nmother also had yearly contact with the Russian consulate in the United States from \n2017 to 2020, concerning her request that she receive her pension from the Russian \ngovernment in the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother is aware that Applicant is seeking a \nnational security position. (Items 4, 15) \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant had six delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$24,212 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.f), and five delinquent medical debts totaling $1,463 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.g-2.k). She listed her delinquent debts in her July 2021 security clearance application \n(SCA), and she discussed them during her August 2021 interview with a background \ninvestigator. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.j are reported on the August 2021 \ncredit bureau report (CBR), and all the SOR debts are reported on the March 2022 \nCBR. An incident report regarding Applicant\u2019s self-reported debts was filed in the \nDefense Information System for Security (DISS) in June 2022, before the SOR was \nissued, and the report reflected that she provided payoff letters for five unalleged debts. \nShe stated in her Answer that she settled and resolved all the SOR debts in June and \nJuly 2022. She provided documentation reflecting that she paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.d, \n2.e, and 2.f in June 2022. None of the SOR debts are reported on the October 2022 \ncredit bureau report. (Items 2, 4-15) \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to their home purchase in July 2019, \nwhich proved to be more expensive than they originally budgeted. In addition, her \nspouse experienced a reduction in hours at work, at a date not in the record, and they \nincurred legal expenses related to his April 2020 charge for driving under the influence. \nShe also cited to the following circumstances that occurred in the several years prior to \nher Answer: \nI didn\u2019t have the money to pay them on time due to some medical \nreasons, financial issues due to my pregnancies, low[-]income jobs, high \ndeductible insurance plans with high co-pays plans, mortgage, COVID-19 \npandemic, and other family circumstances that prevented me from paying. \n(Items 2, 4, 15) \nApplicant indicated in her August 2021 background interview that she earned \n$72,000 annually, and her spouse earned $83,000 annually. They worked closely \ntogether to address their expenses, and she does not have any other delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence in the record that she received credit counseling.

(Items 2, 15) \nRussia \nRussia has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by \nPresident Vladimir Putin. The bicameral federal assembly lacks independence from the \nexecutive. The 2018 presidential election and the 2021 lower-house elections were \nmarked by accusations of government interference and manipulation of the electoral \nprocess. A July 2020 referendum on constitutional amendments did not meet \ninternationally recognized standards, and the new constitutional amendments provide \nPresident Putin the opportunity to remain in power until 2036. \nThe U.S. Government has escalated sanctions on Russia since 2014, in \nresponse to Russia\u2019s incursions into Ukraine, cyberattacks, malign influence, use of \nchemical weapons, and election meddling. In its February 2022 Annual Threat \nAssessment, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) reported that \nRussia presents one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States, \nusing its intelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide \nWestern alliances and increase its sway around the world, while attempting to \nundermine U.S. global standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and \ninfluence U.S. voters and decision making. ODNI also assessed that Russia will \nremain a top cyber threat as it refines and employs its espionage, influence, and attack \ncapabilities. \nIn July 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center reported that \nbesides cyberspace, other methods of collecting sensitive U.S. technologies include \nuse of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West; \nrecruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills by the Russian \nintelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and private \nenterprises. Under Russian law, the Federal Security Service (FSB) can compel \nRussian firms doing business in the United States, or Russians working with U.S. \nfirms, to comply with FSB information sharing and operational mandates, presenting \nadditional routes for cyber espionage. \nThe U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Russia, \nadvising U.S. persons not to travel to Russia due to unprovoked and unjustified \ninvasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces; the potential for harassment against \nU.S. citizens by Russian government security officials; the singling out of U.S. citizens \nin Russia by Russian government security officials, including for detention; the arbitrary \nenforcement of local law; limited flights into and out of Russia; the U.S. Embassy\u2019s \nlimited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia; COVID-19 and related entry restrictions; \nand terrorism. U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately.  \nU.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. Government and military \npersonnel and private citizens engaged in business, who are visiting or residing in \nRussia have been interrogated without cause and threatened by Russian officials, and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. All U.S. Government \npersonnel should carefully consider their need to travel to Russia. Russian security \nservices have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, singled out U.S. citizens in \nRussia for detention and/or harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, \nand convicted them in secret trials and/or without presenting credible evidence. \nRussian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance to detained U.S. \ncitizens. Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S-Russian nationals and may \nrefuse to acknowledge dual nationals\u2019 U.S. citizenship, deny their access to U.S. \nconsular assistance, prevent their departure from Russia, and conscript dual nationals \nfor military service. \nRussia has used counterterrorism and \u201cextremism\u201d as pretexts to suppress the \nexercise of human rights, or for other objectives in both domestic and foreign policy. \nThe formal counterterrorism dialogue framework between the United States and \nRussia remained on hold because of public, unfounded statements by Russian \nsecurity officials alleging U.S. support for ISIS. \nIn its 2020 Human Rights Report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsignificant human rights issues in Russia included: extrajudicial killings and attempted \nextrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; pervasive torture by law enforcement \nofficers; harsh and life-threatening conditions prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; \npolitical and religious prisoners and detainees; politically motivated reprisals against \nindividuals located outside the country; severe arbitrary interference with privacy; \nsevere suppression of freedom of expression and media; violence against journalists; \nblacking and filtering of internet content and banning of online anonymity; severe \nsuppression of the right of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; severe \nrestrictions of religious freedom; refoulement of refugees; inability of citizens to change \ntheir government peacefully through free and fair elections; severe limits on \nparticipation in the political process; widespread corruption at all levels and in all \nbranches of government; lack of investigation of and accountability for violence against \nwomen; coerced abortion and forced sterilization; trafficking in persons; and crimes \ninvolving violence or threats of violence against persons with disabilities, members of \nethnic minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons. The \ngovernment failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, or punish \nmost officials who committed abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \nIn March 2022, President Putin signed into law a bill criminalizing the spread of \ninformation in Russia that authorities deem as \u201cfalse information\u201d that contradicts the \nRussian narrative of its military actions in Ukraine. The Russian government \ncensorship agency blocked access to social media platforms, and restricted access in \nRussia to international news outlets. In September 2022, the Russian government \nbegan a mobilization of its citizens to the armed forces in support of its invasion of \nUkraine. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s father, stepmother, and half-\nsisters are Russian citizens residing in Russia. Russia presents one of the most serious \nforeign influence threats to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issued a \nLevel 4 travel advisory for Russia, advising U.S. persons not to travel to Russia. Russia \nenforces special restrictions on dual U.S-Russian nationals. Although she stated that \nher communication with her father decreased, she had weekly telephonic and electronic \ncontact with her father and stepmother, and monthly electronic contact with her half-\nsisters, as of her 2021 SCA. She also saw her family in Russia when she traveled there \nin 2008, 2009, and 2011. Her father and stepmother are aware that she is seeking a \nnational security position. The totality of the evidence in the record demonstrates that \nApplicant\u2019s family in Russia creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). Although Applicant has not traveled to Russia since 2011, as of her \n2021 SCA, she maintained weekly contact with her father and stepmother and monthly \ncontact with her half-sisters there. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant complied with \nreporting requirements, to include reporting her family in Russia in her SCA, during her \nbackground interview, and in her Answer. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2008. She is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen and holds a U.S. passport. Her spouse is a permanent U.S. resident, and their \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchildren are native-born U.S. citizens. They have owned their home in the United States \nsince 2019. These are factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, her ties to her \nfamily in Russia are also strong. She failed to meet her burden to demonstrate that she \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying her \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her delinquent debts. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. As demonstrated by the DISS incident report, she began \nresolving her self-reported debts before the SOR was issued. She paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, \n2.d, 2.e, 2.f in June 2022. She stated that she paid all the SOR debts in June and July \n2022, and none of the SOR debts are reported on the most recent credit bureau report \nfrom October 2022 \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payment on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she \nneed only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant does not have any other delinquent debts. While she did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate her efforts that she paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.g through 2.k, \nshe has demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she has the means \nto continue to resolve them. I find that Applicant\u2019s finances do not continue to cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) \nare established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but she did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her foreign connections. Accordingly, I conclude she has \nnot carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/24/2023 \nDecision \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant provided evidence sufficient to mitigate the national security concern \narising from her federal student loan history. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application (SCA) on August 26, 2021. \nThe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 3, 2022, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DOD as \nof June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an answer (Answer) to the SOR on August 11, 2022 and \nelected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On August 30, 2022, Department Counsel submitted \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as \nItems 1 through 6. DOHA sent the FORM to Applicant on September 6, 2022, who \nreceived it on September 9, 2022. She was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not \nrespond to the FORM. The SOR and the Answer (Items 1S and 1A, respectively) are the \npleadings in the case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on December 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 33 years old, married (March 2017), and has no children. She earned \nan associate\u2019s degree in May 2013 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Since March \n2021, she has worked for a defense contractor. (Item 2.) \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent federal student loans totaling $35,230 and two \ndelinquent consumer debts totaling $2,820. (Item 1S.) Applicant admitted the student loan \nallegations, stating: \u201cI was making payments to my loans and then Covid-19 put \neverything on hold and I wasn\u2019t allowed to make payments. I will resume making \npayments when allowed.\u201d She denied the two consumer debts, saying that they had been \npaid in full. She produced no documents. (Item 1A.) In her October 5, 2021 Personal \nSubject Interview (PSI), she explained further about her student loans: \nShe took about $25,000 to $30,000 per year in loans for a total of \n$50,000. She started making payments monthly payments of $130 in 2015. \nShe had no problems making those payments until Covid-19 froze all \npayments in the spring of 2020. No payments were expected. She has not \nbeen notified when payments will be starting again. She has heard nothing \nfrom creditors, a collection agency, or a government agency. That was why \nshe did not list these loans on her [SCA]. She believed they were in good \nstanding. She said the current balance is about $35,000. (Item 3.) \nApplicant completed a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) on March 22, 2022. \nShe and her spouse earn $5,000 per month. Their monthly expenses and debt service \ntotal $3,000. Thus, their net monthly remainder is $1,994. (Item 4.) \nEach of Applicant\u2019s federal student loans are noted as follows on the credit reports: \nPLACED FOR COLLECTION, STUDENT LOAN ASSIGNED TO GOVERNMENT, \nCLOSED. Otherwise, her credit reports show no defaults, save for the two SOR non-\nstudent loan accounts she claims have been paid in full. (Items 5 and 6.) \nThe following is the latest on the status of the federal student loan program: \n2 \n\n \nThe student loan payment pause began in March 2020. The student loan \npayment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of Education [DOE] is \npermitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation is resolved. \nPayments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program has not been \nimplemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023 \u2013 \npayments will resume 60 days after that. We [DOE] will notify borrowers \nbefore payments restart. \nCOVID-19 Emergency Relief and Federal Student Aid https://studentaid.gov>covid-\n19/public-service-loan-forgiveness. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. I \nhave considered the following three conditions, because they are the ones most \ncommonly implicated in financial cases: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant spent five years faithfully paying $130 per month to defray her student \nloans. That track record was interrupted only by Covid-19 and the federal government\u2019s \npayment pause. She has stated her willingness to resume payments when notified. Her \nPFS shows she is quite capable of resuming those payments. The payment pause \nremains in effect, until further notice by the Government. None of the three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions quoted above apply. Nor do any other conditions in AG \u00b6 19 \napply. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \n\u00b6 20. \nThe amounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1i. and 1.l do not raise national security concerns. \nI find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about her eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n4 \n\n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.l.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

On September 8, 2021, the drug laboratory reported that his sample tested positive \nfor cocaine with a confirmation level of 402 ng/ml. The cutoff was 100 ng/ml. (Items 4, 5) \nAs a result of testing positive for cocaine, on September 27, 2021, his commander \nnotified Applicant that his current access to classified information would be suspended. \nOn September 28, 2021, Applicant\u2019s command followed up with a classified information \ndebriefing.

(Item 2) \nThe course of treatment was as follows: \nPt was referred to ADAPT on 14 Sep 2021 by CC/CCF. Pt\u2019s referral \nstated, \u201cMember received positive results for cocaine from a random \nDDRP screening.\u201d Pt did NOT meet criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder and \nsuccessfully completed 3 sessions of brief education on 05 Nov 2021.

(Item \n2)  \nApplicant\u2019s ADAPT records reflect compliance with the program and his coming \nto terms with the adverse effects of alcohol. He noted in his SOR Answer that his \nexcessive consumption of alcohol led to him not being \u201cin the right head space due to \nbeing influenced by alcohol and this led me to do something I still regret until this day.\u201d \n(Item 2) \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in \nJanuary 2022 for illegal use of a controlled substance. SOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges the \ninformation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. Applicant admitted both of these allegations in his \nSOR Answer. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the information in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. \nFollowing up on the report of Applicant testing positive for cocaine, the Air Force \nSecurity Forces Squadron conducted an investigation. The investigation revealed that \nApplicant wrongfully used a controlled substance in violation of Article 112a, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ). (Items 6, 10) Applicant\u2019s commander imposed \nnonjudicial punishment, pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, on September 22, 2021, reducing \nhim from staff sergeant (pay grade E-5) to senior airman (pay grade E-4), and ordered \nthat he be given a formal reprimand. His commander further ordered that he be \nadministratively separated from the Air Force. (Items 9, 10, 11) On January 13, 2022, \nApplicant was separated from the Air Force with a General Discharge under Honorable \nConditions. (Items 11, 12) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted two reference letters: (1) a civilian co-worker who worked \nwith Applicant in the base contracting office from December 2020 to October 2021 \n(letter dated October 25, 2021); and (2) an active duty Air Force master sergeant, who \nworked with Applicant in an overseas location from December 2019 to November 2020 \n(letter dated October 22, 2021).

He stated that his \nADAPT was successful and taught him coping mechanisms to deal with stress and not \nto resort to binge drinking. He added that since his discharge from the Air Force, he has \nstrong family support in the form of his two older brothers. He lives with his oldest \nbrother and spends time with his other brother. Both brothers have Top Secret \nclearances. He states that his brothers have been a positive influence on him by \nencouraging him to finish his bachelor\u2019s degree and to pursue his goals in spite of \nsetbacks. He gave his assurances that he would not use illegal drugs again and would \nlike the opportunity to serve the Government in the future. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(f). Further discussion is \nrequired. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug\ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future\ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility; \n \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For \nthe recency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s most recent cocaine use occurred in August 2021, 11 months before \nhis July 2022 SOR was issued, and 13 months before Department Counsel\u2019s FORM. \nApplicant asserts that he has turned his life around, that he no longer wants to use \nillegal drugs, and will not use illegal drugs in the future. Among the problems here is the \nrecency of his illegal drug use and his use while granted access to classified \ninformation. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s written assertions that he is drug-free and has no \nintention of using illegal drugs in the future lack corroboration. While Applicant\u2019s ADAPT \nprogress notes are favorable, his ADAPT program ended in November 2021. There is \nno recent information comparable to his ADAPT progress notes confirming sobriety \nsince he was discharged from the Air Force in January 2022. Accordingly, mitigation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit under AG \u00b6 26(a) is not warranted at this time. Applicant is able to receive partial \ncredit for acknowledging his drug involvement and substance misuse under AG \u00b6 26(b) \nfor and changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used under subsection \n(2). However, the overall circumstances do not warrant full mitigation of security \nconcerns under Guideline H. In summary, apart from partial application of AG \u00b6 26(b), \nno other mitigating conditions fully apply. \nPersonal Conduct  \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the information under SOR \u00b6 1.a (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) as a personal conduct concern. A review of the disqualifying \nconditions under personal do not warrant application with regard to the facts of this \ncase. However, and more appropriately, disqualifying conditions under drug involvement \nand substance misuse and criminal conduct do apply. Accordingly, I find for Applicant \nunder personal conduct security concerns. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nThe evidence establishes AG \u00b6 31(b). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the\noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \nThe comments under drug involvement and substance misuse are incorporated \nin this section. Applicant deserves credit for acknowledging his behavior and for \nparticipating in ADAPT before being discharged from the Air Force. He also deserves \ncredit for pursuing his college degree and choosing an environment where he has \nstrong family support and positive role models in the form of his two older brothers. \nPartial credit under Application of AG \u00b6 31(d) is warranted. However, the facts do not \nwarrant application of the remaining mitigating conditions under this concern. As noted \nin the discussion under drug involvement and substance misuse, not enough time has \nelapsed since Applicant\u2019s drug use coupled with the lack of recent documented sobriety. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of Appellant\u2019s acts, omissions, and \nmotivations. Each case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines H, E, and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nAppellant honorably served on active duty in the Air Force for almost ten years \nand achieved the rank of staff sergeant. Reference letters from two individuals who \nknew him well described his positive contributions to the Air Force, potential for future \nservice, and argued for leniency. However, using cocaine while granted access to \nclassified information constituted a breach of trust as well as a violation of the UCMJ \nthat the Air Force could not ignore. Applicant\u2019s choice to use drugs proved to be very \ncostly. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nApplicant has sought to rehabilitate himself. He participated in ADAPT while in \nthe Air Force and embraced the program. Since his discharge from the Air Force, he \nseems sincere in his efforts to turn the corner and put this past incident behind him. He \nis in a supportive environment, especially with his two older brothers serving as role \nmodels for him. However, what is lacking is additional time, but more important is \nevidence of sobriety. With that said, there is no reason Applicant cannot in the future \nrecover and regain eligibility for access to classified information in the future. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the security concerns \nraised. By failing to provide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking \nsufficient detail to fully establish mitigation, drug involvement and substance misuse \nconsiderations and criminal conduct security concerns remain. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 12968, DOD \nManual 5200.02, the AGs, and other cited references to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. For the reasons stated, I conclude Appellant failed to \nmitigate security concerns under Guidelines H and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant again blames his misconduct on \n\u201cundiagnosed ADD and Anxiety.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nApplicant solicited prostitutes for sexual intercourse in the Philippines in 2012, in \nPanama in 2015, in Alabama in 2017, and at an unspecified location in 2018. His conduct \nis criminal and represents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. It also creates a vulnerability to coercion or duress, as is apparent \nfrom his attempts to conceal it that are discussed below under Guideline E. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant is 30 years old. He has \nsolicited prostitutes on multiple occasions from 2012~2018. There is no evidence that \nfuture instances of this nature are unlikely to occur. He has not attended any counseling. \nSexual Behavior is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited\nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with\nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph\nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCAs, the following disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16 (b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployer, investigator, security official . . . or other official government \nrepresentative. \nAG \u00b6 16 (d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination. . . . This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violation. \nApplicant failed to disclose his security violations in a timely fashion, and continued \nhis deceptions during security processing interviews in June and August of 2019. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused\nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with\nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of these apply. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct \nhis concealments. He also has demonstrated a pattern dishonesty and rule violations. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient information in this record to demonstrate that he has \nmet his burden of proof for his personal conduct. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant solicited illegal prostitution from 2012~2018, in four locations, including \nat least two foreign countries, over a period of about six years. This evidence raises \nsecurity concerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of these apply. Applicant repeatedly failed to report his fairly recent, illegal \nsexual misconduct. The evidence does not establish mitigation under any of the above \nconditions. Criminal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information (HPI) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information is set \nout in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 34. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; \n(e) copying or modifying protected information in an unauthorized manner \ndesigned to conceal or remove classification or other document control \nmarkings; and  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn 2018, Applicant improperly brought home classified documents. In his Answer \nhe admits \u201cto burn the page that was marked \u2018Secret.\u2019\u201d In 2019, Applicant brought an \nunauthorized thumb drive inside his secure workplace. \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training \nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no evidence of \ncompromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct was proactive, and he tried to cover up \nhis misconduct by partially destroying a protected document. Handling protected \nInformation (HPI) is found against Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, E, J and K in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D, E, J and K, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his repeated sexual behavior, personal and criminal \nmisconduct, and mishandling of protected information. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1 Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2 Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3 Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4 Guideline K (HPI): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a. and 4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nRichard A.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He is not married \nand has no children. He has been employed by a federal contractor since July 2018. (Item \n3) \nIn June 2016, Applicant was employed as a summer intern for a company that had \nrandom drug testing. He was terminated the same month for testing positive for marijuana \non a random drug test. He explained that he had used marijuana several weeks prior to \nstarting the job. (Items 3, 5) \nIn October 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it \nhe disclosed that from 2013 to October 2021, he occasionally used marijuana about once \nevery two months on average from 2013 to 2014; once every two weeks while attending \ncollege from 2014 to 2018, more frequently during the school year and less frequently \nduring the summer months; and once a month on average from 2020 to 2021. (Item 3) \nApplicant stated in his SCA the following: \nI inten[d] to use THC on occasional frequency in the future provided nothing \nregarding my employment responsibilities changes. One potential impact to \nmy employment responsibilities would be the successful obtainment of a \nFederal Security Clearance. In this case, I would refrain from using THC \nwhile in possession of the clearance. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed that he purchased marijuana illegally from people he knew in \nhis hometown and at college about once every two months from 2013 to 2018. It was not \nlegal in his state when he purchased it. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA that he used hallucinogenic drugs five times. He \nused LSD twice in 2014 and once in 2020 and mushrooms once in 2017 and 2019. He \nstated he does not intend to use these drugs in the future because it does not appeal to \nhim and the risks of using them are too high. (Item 3) \nAdditionally, Applicant disclosed that from 2015 to September 2020 he used \ncocaine eight times. It was provided by someone else and he consumed it through his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnose. He reported that five of his uses were in college, then twice in late 2018 and once \nin 2020. He reported he does not intend to use cocaine in the future as it was not an \nappealing drug to him and the risks of using it were too high. (Item 3) \nIn December 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as \npart of his background investigation. He reported to the investigator that his last use of \nmarijuana was October 2021. He confirmed his previously disclosed cocaine and \nhallucinogenic drug use and frequency. He confirmed that he continues to have contact \nwith two of his friends with whom he used illegal drugs. He said he changed his mind \nabout using marijuana and other illegal drugs in the future, and he does not intend to use \nany illegal drugs in the future. He is focused on his future. He explained he used all of \nthese drugs for fun and recreation. (Item 5) \nIn June 2022, Applicant completed government interrogatories. He was transferred \nby his employer and moved to a new state in October 2021. Marijuana can be legally \nobtained in that state. He reported in his interrogatories that his last use of marijuana was \nNovember 2021 in the state where he had moved. This contradicts the date that he told \nthe government investigator that his last use was October 2021. He stated he decided to \nstop using marijuana. (Items 3, 4) He said: \nDecided to focus on career including security clearance application. \nDecided risk to career, reputation, legal action was not worth it. Additionally \ndecided to focus on physical health as an adult. (Item 4) \nApplicant stated he continues to associate with persons who use illegal substances \nand frequents places where he has reason to believe illegal substances are used or are \nused in his presence. He stated that this occurs about once every three months at \nconcerts and outdoor parks, but he typically does not find himself in these situations. He \nreported that when he had been in situations where illegal drugs were present, he \nremoved himself and made it clear he had made a decision not to use illegal drugs. (Item \n4) \nApplicant stated that he has changed his professional situation and joined a new \nteam at his job, which supports the military, and having a security clearance is desirable. \nHe said he applied for a security clearance in December 2021. His SCA was signed on \nOctober 22, 2021. (Items 3, 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana during a random drug test administered by \nhis employer in June 2016. Applicant possessed and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2013 to November 2021. From 2015 to September 2020, he \npossessed and used cocaine with varying frequency. From 2014 to 2020, he possessed \nand used LSD and mushrooms with varying frequency. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and mushrooms while in high school and \ncollege from 2013 to 2018. This perhaps can be attributed to a period of experimental \nand youthful indiscretion. However, he continued to use illegal drugs after he graduated \nfrom college in 2018 and was employed by a federal contractor. He initially intended to \ncontinue using marijuana unless he was granted a security clearance. Later, during his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nbackground interview (December 2021) and in his June 2022 interrogatories, he changed \nhis mind and declared his intention not to use illegal drugs in the future, so he could focus \non his career. Applicant continues to associate with friends with whom he used illegal \ndrugs. After completing his SCA in October 2021, he disclosed in his June 2022 response \nto interrogatories that he was transferred by his employer to a new state, where marijuana \nis legal under state law, and he used it in November 2021. \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM with any additional evidence \nregarding his drug involvement or commitment to abstinence. Because Applicant chose \nto have his case decided without a hearing, I was unable to make a credibility \ndetermination of Applicant\u2019s sincerity and commitment to remain drug free. It is \nconcerning that after being fired by an employer in 2016 for testing positive for marijuana, \nand being put on notice that marijuana and other illegal drug use is incompatible with \ncertain employment, he continued to use it after being hired by a federal contractor. I also \nhave concerns that after clearly being put on notice about drug use when he completed \nhis SCA in October 2021, he used marijuana in November 2021. I find that Applicant\u2019s \nhandwritten disclosures in his interrogatories, which were sworn to in the state where he \nhad recently moved, noting the date and place of his last use, are more credible than the \nsummary of interview from the government investigator. There is insufficient evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s conduct was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances, and is \nunlikely to recur. Without additional evidence, I find his illegal drugs use casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) and 25(b) do not \napply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination,\nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was fired from his job in 2016, while he was a summer intern, for testing \npositive for marijuana. The SOR alleges his termination for testing positive for marijuana \nunder the personal conduct guideline. I have previously addressed concerns under the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse guideline regarding his use and termination from \nhis job in 2016. I find that his termination from a job as a 20-year-old summer intern does \nnot rise to the level of making him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress or \nhaving the potential to affect his personal, professional, or community standing. I find the \nabove disqualifying condition does not apply and in Applicant\u2019s favor under this guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. I find the evidence \ndid not support the application of a disqualifying condition under Guideline E, personal \nconduct, and find in his favor. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has had access to classified information since June 2011, and he \nhas stated his intent to use marijuana in the future. Applicant did not mitigate the resulting \nsecurity concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse. His request for \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 10, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation required for his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of \nDefense (DOD) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information, as required by \nExecutive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nOn December 13, 2022, the DOD sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts and security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). The action was taken pursuant to and consistent with Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On April 18, 2023, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that Applicant received on May 18, 2023.

He did not submit any additional information and he did not raise any objections \nto the Government\u2019s exhibits. The record closed on June 20, 2023, and I received the \ncase for decision on September 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between 1968 \nand January 2022 (SOR 1.a); that between June 2014 and January 2022, his use of \nmarijuana occurred while he had access to classified information (SOR 1.b); and that he \nintends to continue using marijuana (SOR 1.c). (FORM, Item 1) \nIn response to the SOR, he admitted, with comments, the allegations at SOR 1.a \nand 1.b. He denied, with comments, the SOR 1.c allegation. (FORM, Item 2) The facts \nalleged at SOR 1.a and 1.b are established by his admissions, and based on my review \nof the information presented in the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked in an information technology (IT) position since November 2010. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and he has been married since 1984. He and his wife have \none adult child. (FORM, Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed in Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2021 \ne-QIP that he used marijuana between June 2014 and May 2020. He could not state with \nany precision how many times or how often he used marijuana because he did not use \nor possess the drug unless he happened to be socializing with friends who were using \nmarijuana and offered it to him. As to his intentions regarding future use of marijuana, he \nstated the following: \nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t going to ever, ever again have a smoke knowing \nit\u2019s quite likely I will find myself (as I have in the past) in a situation sometime \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nin the future where others are passing it around. You might find this \nincredible to believe, but marijuana is really popular, especially now that it \nis (about to be) legal in [the state where he lives and works]. (FORM, Item \n3) \nOn August 25, 2021, Applicant completed a personal subject interview (PSI) by a \ngovernment investigator as part of his most recent background investigation. During the \nPSI, he confirmed his disclosed use between 2014 and 2020, estimating he smokes \nmarijuana between three and six times a year when it is offered to him in social settings. \nHe also stated that he knows his drug use violates federal workplace policies. In response \nto interrogatories from Department Counsel, Applicant disclosed that he has used \nmarijuana since 1968, but ceased frequent use in 1984. When he was first hired by his \ncurrent employer in 2010, he submitted an e-QIP in which he was required to disclose, \ninter alia, any illegal drug use in the preceding seven years. He answered \u201cno\u201d to all of \nthe Section 23 questions in that clearance application. He was first granted a security \nclearance and access to classified information based on a background investigation \ncompleted in March 2011. As to his future intent to use marijuana, Applicant now avers \nthat he will abstain from using marijuana while he has \u201can active security clearance.\u201d \n(FORM, Items 2, 5, and 6) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013, and by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in December 2021, \nmakes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this issue, \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his state of \nresidence, is illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by civilian federal \nemployees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government presented information that reasonably raises the security \nconcern about drug involvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant has illegally used marijuana since 1968, when he was a teenager. \nDespite claiming he has not used it frequently since 1984, he has continued to use it until \nas recently as early 2022, after age 70. He also has illegally used marijuana while having \naccess to classified information as a defense contractor.

Further, he offers that he will not use marijuana while he has \u201can active \nsecurity clearance.\u201d At a minimum, his statements in this regard fail to show that he is \nclearly committed to abstaining from using marijuana in the future. The foregoing requires \napplication of the following AG \u00b6 25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nBy contrast, I have considered the potential applicability of the pertinent mitigating \nconditions presented under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant to present \ninformation that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. Applicant did \nnot present information that would support any of these mitigating conditions. His history \nof drug use is extensive, occurring as it has for most of his life, and he did not present \nsufficient information to show that the circumstances surrounding his drug use have \nchanged. To the contrary, he suggests they have not. Additionally, even if, as alleged in \nthe SOR, he has not used marijuana since January 2022, such a recent period of \nabstinence would not be sufficient, when compared to the previous five decades, to show \nthat his conduct will not recur. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to future intent, his statements are equivocal, at best, making future use \ncontingent on whether he has a clearance. Thus, if he does not have a clearance, then he \nwould still be willing to disregard existing laws and policy governing controlled substances. \nI also note that he did not disclose any drug use in the e-QIP he submitted in 2010, when \nhe was first hired by his employer. His initial clearance was granted in 2011 based on \nincomplete information. When he was interviewed by a government investigator during his \nmost recent background investigation, he did not explain the full scope of his drug use, \nchoosing instead to confirm his statement that he had used marijuana since 2014. It was \nnot until he responded to Department Counsel\u2019s interrogatories in January 2023 that he \ndisclosed the full extent of his illegal drug use. The Government did not allege that he \nmade any false official statements about his drug use. Nonetheless, I have considered his \nomissions (as well as the flippant nature of some of his comments regarding his drug use) \nfor the limited purpose of assessing his credibility, evaluating his evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances, and considering whether he has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, \n2017). \nFinally, while Applicant\u2019s drug use may be legal under the laws of his state, it is still \nimpermissible under federal controlled substances laws and DOD industrial security policy \nguidance. During his PSI, he acknowledged his awareness that using marijuana was \ninconsistent with DOD policies regarding illegal drug use in the workplace. On balance, \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns established by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, \nalong with the Government\u2019s information, leaves unchanged the doubts raised about his \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations regarding the \nprotection of sensitive information. Because the protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal goal of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

He submitted exhibits (AE) A-C, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with some \nexplanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in 2014. He has been married for 23 years. He has two minor children \nand one adult child, all whom live with him. (Tr. 6, 17-19; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed approximately $8,742 from his 2017 federal tax \nreturn and approximately $1,082 from his 2018 federal tax return. He admitted these \ndebts in his SOR answer and during his hearing testimony. (Tr. 20-21; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that he owed delinquent taxes for 2017 and 2018 because his \ntax preparer filed an erroneous 2017 tax return, which resulted in a higher tax bill for \nthat year and 2018. Applicant documented reaching an agreement with the IRS on the \ntax amount owed and began making monthly payments of approximately $153. He \nmade these payments from December 2021 until June 2022, when he stopped because \nhe was made aware of the erroneous 2017 return. He hired a tax preparation company \nin November 2022 to investigate the possible error and file an amended return if \nwarranted. In the meantime, he was advised to restart making his monthly payments of \n$154 to the IRS, which was to begin in July 2023. He documented his agreement with \nthe tax preparation company and the company corroborated his settlement agreement \nwith the IRS. (Tr. 20-22; AE A) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed 10 delinquent accounts (debt \nconsolidation loan, credit cards, and consumer debts) totaling approximately $39,000. \nThe debts are established by credit reports from August 2021, March 2022, October \n2022, and May 2023; Appellant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c \u2013 1.l). (Tr. 27; GE 3-6; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted all the SOR debts during his testimony. He also admitted that \nhe has not made any payments toward any of the debts as of the date of the hearing. \nHe admitted living beyond his means. He substantiated that one debt was paid (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) through the enforcement of a court-ordered garnishment in 2022 for a debt where \nthe creditor had obtained a judgment. Applicant did not voluntarily contribute to the \npayment of this debt. All the remaining debts remain unresolved.

Post-hearing, a representative from the DRC provided \na letter stating that it was going to work with Applicant to help resolve his credit issues \nby removing negative entries from his credit report. There is no information in the letter \ndetailing a plan to pay Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. (Tr. 25-26, 44; AE C) \nApplicant did not provide a formalized budget, but he testified that his monthly \n\u201ctake-home pay\u201d is about $3,700 and his wife\u2019s is about $2,000. He stated that he barely \ncovers his monthly expenses. His testimony revealed that he is currently two months \nbehind on making his two vehicle payments. (Since this information was not alleged in \nthe SOR, I will use it only as it pertains to applicability of any mitigating conditions and in \napplying the whole-person factors) He also stated that he has approximately $36,000 in \nhis retirement account. (Tr. 40-41, 44-46) \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer related that his financial problems started when his wife \n\u201cgot COVID-19 and lost her job.\u201d He did not provide a date when this occurred. He later \ntestified that his wife started working again in June 2022 and continues to do so. He did \nnot pay or set up payment plans for any of the SOR debts after his wife began working \nagain. (Tr. 30-31; SOR answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. He also admitted owing federal taxes for 2017 and 2018. I find all of the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and he admitted that he has not paid or resolved \nthem. He failed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is \nunlikely. On the contrary he is now delinquent paying his two car loans. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s wife unemployment due to the pandemic is a condition beyond \nhis control, however, by failing to address his debts he has not acted responsibly. He \nadmittedly was living beyond his means, and the only SOR debt paid was done through \nan involuntary garnishment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nAside from his contact with a DRC to help him remove items from his credit \nreport and his hiring of a tax firm to assist with his tax issues, Applicant did not present \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nevidence of financial counseling. He failed to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. The payment from the garnishment action is not a good-faith payment. Given the \nunpaid status of his debts and his new past-due debts, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply. Applicant acted promptly \nto address his tax issues and arranged monthly payments to the IRS beginning in \nDecember 2021. He continued making those payments until he was advised his 2017 \ntax return may contain an error. While that issue is being considered, Applicant is \nscheduled to begin monthly payments again. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b are being resolved. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to those allegations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s his wife\u2019s unemployment due to the pandemic, and the \ncircumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has \nmade insufficient efforts to resolve his debts and he has accumulated new delinquent \ndebt since the SOR was issued. He has not established a meaningful track record of \nfinancial responsibility, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.c-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on January 18, 2023. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments, identified as Items 1 through 7 in its FORM, are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 42 years old. He is \nmarried and he has one child, a minor. He previously owned a home between \nSeptember 2003 and October 2021. As of his October 2021 security clearance \napplication (SCA), he has owned a home since July 2012. He attended college from \n2009 to 2021 but did not earn a degree. He has worked as an electronic technician for \nhis employer, a DOD contractor, since February 2006. He was granted a security \nclearance in 2012. (Items 1-2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had a $12,558 delinquent consumer debt and a \n$40 delinquent medical debt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) The SOR also alleges that Applicant \nfalsified his response to questions in section 26 of his 2021 SCA, which inquired about \nfinancial delinquencies, when he failed to disclose SOR \u00b6 1.a and an unalleged $54,756 \npast-due mortgage account. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In addition to his admissions in his Answer, \nApplicant discussed his delinquent debts in his January 2022 and February 2022 \ninterviews with a background investigator, and in his June 2022 response to \ninterrogatories. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and his past-due mortgage account referenced in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, are reported in a December 2021 credit bureau report. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nare also reported in a September 2022 credit bureau report. Incident reports from the \nDefense Information System for Security Case Adjudication Tracking System also \nreflect Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. (Items 1-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a charged-off credit card. Applicant indicated during his \nbackground interviews that he neglected to set up auto-payments after this account was \ntransferred to a different servicer. He then forgot about it because he did not receive \nany notices from the creditor about a delinquent balance, and he was unaware it was \ndelinquent. He intended to contact the creditor to resolve this debt. He stated in his \nresponse to interrogatories that he had not made efforts to resolve this debt. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a medical debt for a 2020 emergency room visit. Applicant indicated \nduring both of his background interviews that he forgot about this debt, and he was \nunaware it was delinquent. He thought his medical insurance paid it and he was never \nbilled for it. He intended to contact the creditor to pay this debt. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his efforts at resolution. (Item 3) \nApplicant maintained during his February 2022 background interview that he did \nnot intend to deceive by failing to disclose his past-due mortgage account on his SCA. \nHe indicated that this mortgage is for his primary residence. In late 2019, he made an \nerror when he attempted to rearrange his automatically deducted monthly mortgage \npayment on the creditor\u2019s website. His last mortgage payment was auto deducted in \nDecember 2019, and he made no subsequent mortgage payments. He indicated that he \nattempted to correct his mistake on multiple occasions during the COVID-19 pandemic, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nbut he never received a live representative when he contacted the creditor\u2019s customer \nservice department. He acknowledged that he was neglectful and irresponsible in failing \nto continue to follow up with the customer service department. In early 2022, he \nreached a live representative who arranged for him to make a $63,890 payment at a \nretail branch, which brought his mortgage current. He was able to make such a payment \nbecause his \u201cbudgeted mortgage payment fund was still in my account,\u201d and he used \nsavings to pay the penalties. He indicated that he likely completed his SCA during the \nperiod when he was trying to reach the creditor, and his mortgage was not on his mind. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant indicated during his February 2022 background interview that his \nmonthly net income was $5,881, and that his monthly net remainder after expenses was \n$2,173. He indicated that he had assets totaling $1,291,260. He described his financial \nsituation during his background interviews as stable and indicated that he had a budget. \nHe planned to timely pay his debts. He had not received credit counseling. He traveled \nto Ireland for tourism in 2009 and 2019, and to Canada in 2011. (Items 2-3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u00b6 19(b), an \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his debts \ndespite having the means to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control did not contribute to SOR \u00b6 1.a, as \nApplicant admitted that this debt became delinquent due to his own neglect. However, \nsuch conditions contributed to his medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, as he believed his \nmedical insurance paid this debt and he was not billed for it. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant failed to do so. Although he indicated during his background \ninterviews that he intended to contact the creditors to resolve both debts, he did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his efforts. He has not received financial \ncounseling. His monthly net remainder demonstrates that he has the financial means to \ntake steps toward debt resolution, and yet he has not done so. I find that Applicant\u2019s \nunwillingness to address his debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not intend to falsify his SCA by failing to disclose SOR \u00b6 1.a and his \npast-due mortgage account. He forgot to set up auto-payments for SOR \u00b6 1.a after the \naccount was transferred to a different servicer, and then he was unaware it was \ndelinquent because he did not receive any notices from the creditor. He did not think \nabout his past-due mortgage when he completed his SCA, as he was unable to follow \nup with his mortgage company\u2019s customer service department during the COVID-19 \npandemic to correct his error for his automatic monthly mortgage payments. I find that \nhe did not deliberately falsify his response to section 26 of his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not deliberately falsify \nhis SCA, but he did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns arising \nfrom his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Tr. 64) In May 2012, he received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions, based on a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 22) \nWhile Applicant was pending discharge from the Navy, he self-referred to the \nNavy Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP) and completed a 31-day \ninpatient rehabilitation program. His alcohol use declined after he completed the \nprogram. He stopped drinking between 2014 and 2016. (GX 3 at 4) \nIn June 2014, Applicant was terminated from his job for making a racially \ninsensitive comment to a coworker, an enlisted woman in the Air Force. He considered \nthe coworker a good friend. While off-duty he offered his coworker a drink because he \nhad two drinks in front of him. She declined, and he made a comment that she \ninterpreted as racial profiling. She complained to their supervisor, and he was \nterminated. Applicant disclosed this incident in his SCA as follows: \nFormal complaint regarding professionalism was submitted by Air Force \nmember against me. Terminated by company without being fully \ninvestigated. . . . Formal complaint stated I made racial comments towards \nAir Force member and touched her hair without consent. Air Force \nmember attempted to take complaint back during investigation however \ncompany found it easier to terminate than continue with investigation. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2021, he \ntold the investigator that he offered his coworker a red fruit punch drink and, when she \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndeclined, he told her that everyone loves red fruit punch.

He told the investigator that his \nemployer did not conduct an investigation because the Air Force member no longer \nworked in the building. However, when the Air Force investigated the incident, they \nfound that the Air Force member\u2019s complaint was \u201cincorrect.\u201d He told the investigator \nthat his employer later determined that the coworker\u2019s complaint was unfounded and \noffered him another job within the company, but he no longer wanted to work for the \ncompany. (GX 12 at 2) The record does not contain any documentation of the complaint \nagainst Applicant, the investigation of that complaint, or the termination of Applicant\u2019s \nemployment. \nIn August 2019, Applicant and his cohabitant hosted a joint birthday party for him \nand her son, which was attended by about 30 guests, including Applicant\u2019s neighbor \nand his neighbor\u2019s granddaughter. The party ended at about 2:00 am. Applicant testified \nthat he consumed three or four beers during the day but did not believe he was \nintoxicated. (Tr. 76) \nApplicant testified that, while cleaning up after the party, he noticed that his \ncohabitant\u2019s son was not in his room, and he could not find him anywhere in the house. \nHe knew that some of the children who had attended the party were spending the night \nin his neighbor\u2019s house. He texted his neighbor, asking if his cohabitant\u2019s son was at the \nneighbor\u2019s house. When the neighbor did not respond to the text, Applicant went to the \nneighbor\u2019s house and knocked on the door, but no one responded. Applicant then \nentered the house through an unlocked back door and asked a friend of the cohabitant\u2019s \nson if he was in the house, and the friend stated that he was \u201cin the back.\u201d Applicant \nlooked in one bedroom, but the cohabitant\u2019s son was not there. He then went to a \nsecond bedroom and saw a person in bed who had blonde hair similar to the son\u2019s hair. \nHe testified that he \u201cjust kind of peeked in,\u201d \u201cmight have had one foot in the door to peek \naround the door,\u201d and softly called out the cohabitant\u2019s son\u2019s name. The neighbor\u2019s \ngranddaughter, who was sleeping in the bed, was startled. He apologized and told the \ngranddaughter that he was looking for his cohabitant\u2019s son, and she responded that the \nson was \u201con the couch.\u201d (Tr. 42-43, 50) He found his cohabitant\u2019s son under some \nblankets. At about this time, the neighbor came out of his bedroom and confronted \nApplicant. Applicant apologized, explained why he was there, and left. \nThe neighbor\u2019s granddaughter called the police and told them that Applicant had \nattempted to kiss her, caressed her hips, and invited her to \u201cdo some coke\u201d with him. \nThe granddaughter also told the police that Applicant had touched her breasts during \nthe party on the previous day. \nApplicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a \nmisdemeanor and sexual battery. He was represented by an attorney at the trial. \nPursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to trespassing and assault and battery, \nboth misdemeanors.

In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he admitted trespassing, \nbut he maintained that he was not guilty of the assault and battery and that he pleaded \nguilty to avoid jail time. \nApplicant\u2019s neighbor testified on his behalf at the hearing. His neighbor testified \nthat they continued to have casual contact with each other after the August 2019 \nincident. His neighbor also testified that his granddaughter had several \u201ctraumatic \nissues\u201d in her life and that at the time of the incident, \u201cshe was seeking a lot of attention \nand known to tell fibs.\u201d (Tr. 28) He stopped short of testifying that his granddaughter \nwas lying, but said that he was skeptical about her accusation against Applicant. (Tr. \n28-29, 33-34) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2021, he \ntold the investigator that before his last DUI, he drank six to twelve beers about four \ntimes a week, but he stopped drinking for two years beginning in 2014. At the time of \nthe interview, he had resuming drinking. He told the investigator that he consumed two \nor three beers about once a week, but that about once a year he drank about six beers \nand became intoxicated. (GX 12 at 3) \nIn November 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation at the \nrequest of the DOD CAF. The evaluation was conducted by video teleconference. The \npsychologist noted that he \u201cpresented in this evaluation with a moderately antisocial \nmanner,\u201d \u201cappeared to minimize his responsibility in the problem situations described in \nhis background information,\u201d and \u201cblamed others in instances that appeared to be \nmatters of his own lack of behavioral control.\u201d The psychologist concluded that \nApplicant attempted to mislead him about the details of past events to cast himself in a \nmore positive light than may have been warranted by his actions. \nApplicant told the psychologist that he suffered an estimated 20 instances of \nbroken bones in his lifetime, engaging in sky diving, riding an off-road four-wheeler, \nplaying basketball, and being punched in the face. (GX 3 at 3) At the hearing, he \nadmitted that he has always been a high-energy, adventuresome person. (Tr. 51) \nThe psychologist found that if Applicant entered his neighbor\u2019s home for the \npurpose of sexual encounter with the neighbor\u2019s granddaughter, and touched her and \nconfined her in her room for a time, particularly if he was intoxicated, \u201cthen this act \nwould represent a nexus between his alcohol use problems, antisocial style, impulsivity, \nand stimulus seeking tendencies.\u201d He diagnosed Applicant with \u201calcohol-use disorder, \nsevere, in sustained remission (by subject report).\u201d He suggested the following as \n\u201cdiagnostic \npossibilities,\u201d \nstopping \nshort \nof \na \nformal \ndiagnosis: \nattention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation; \nand other specified personality disorder (with features of antisocial personality disorder). \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s ADHD symptoms and a history of \nalcohol use did not present a significant risk to his reliability, trustworthiness, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, but that \u201chis personality condition certainly could contribute to a lack of \ntrustworthiness in safeguarding national security information.\u201d The psychologist \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s prognosis \u201cis uncertain given that he did not seem to be \nentirely forthright with [him].\u201d (GX 3 at 9) \nThe psychologist listed the following examples of inconsistencies in information \nprovided by Applicant that suggested a lack of candor: \n\u2022 Applicant told him that he could not remember when he last drank \nmore than three beers, but he told an investigator in 2021 that he \ndrinks six or more beers and becomes intoxicated once a year. \n\u2022 Applicant used the term \u201cretired\u201d to describe his departure from the \nNavy even though he was discharged for misconduct. \n\u2022 Applicant said that he \u201cleft\u201d a job in 2014 when in fact he was \nterminated because of a racially related comment, and he provided \nan exculpatory explanation of the event, when the records reflected \nthat he \u201cvery likely\u201d made racially offensive remarks. \n \n \n\u2022 Applicant pleaded guilty to a crime but told the psychologist that he \ndid not sexually assault the victim. \n\u2022 Applicant told him that he had consumed some alcohol but was not \nintoxicated on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2019. \nThe psychologist\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was not \u201centirely forthright\u201d appears \nto be based on the psychologist\u2019s conclusion that all the allegations against Applicant \nprobably were supported by the evidence. While Applicant\u2019s guilty pleas at his trial \nwould justify a conclusion that he trespassed into his neighbor\u2019s home and touched the \nneighbor\u2019s granddaughter, the psychologist apparently believed that Applicant groped \nhis neighbor\u2019s granddaughter at the party, touched her inappropriately after he entered \nhis neighbor\u2019s house, looking for his cohabitant\u2019s son, and invited her to \u201cdo coke\u201d with \nhim. The civil authorities did not charge Applicant with groping the granddaughter or \noffering cocaine to her, and these acts were not alleged in the SOR. \nThe psychologist also appeared to believe that Applicant made an inappropriate \nremark to a coworker that caused him to be fired. The psychologist stated in his report \nthat he was told by Applicant\u2019s mother that he made a comment such as \u201call black \npeople like Kool-Aid.\u201d (GX 3 at 3) There is no statement from Applicant\u2019s mother in the \nrecord. There is no record of the investigation of the complaint. The psychologist \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s description of what he said to a coworker was untrue, \nbecause Applicant\u2019s mother described the comment differently. It is not clear whether \nthe psychologist knew that the complaint was investigated and determined to be \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunfounded, or that he knew that Applicant\u2019s employer offered to give him another job in \nthe company. \nThe psychologist also concluded that Applicant falsely claimed that he was not \nintoxicated on the night of the party, because Applicant admitted to his supervisor that \nhe was intoxicated. The psychologist\u2019s report lists a document from Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor as one of the documents he reviewed, but at the hearing, Department \nCounsel stated, \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to look at that report because of our rules.\u201d (Tr. 115) \nThe security investigator\u2019s report does not include a statement from Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. There is no documentary evidence in the hearing record of any admissions \nby Applicant to his supervisor regarding this event, and no evidence from other \nwitnesses that Applicant was intoxicated at the party. \nFinally, although there is no evidence that Applicant ever was involved with \ncocaine, the psychologist appears to have accepted the granddaughter\u2019s assertions that \nApplicant touched her inappropriately and offered to \u201cdo some coke\u201d with her as true, \nand he concluded that Applicant was not being truthful with him when he denied her \naccusation. \nApplicant decided to stop drinking in 2022, when his son was born. His \ncohabitant left him shortly after the birth, but they share custody of their son. (Tr. 56) He \ntestified that he last consumed alcohol on July 2, 2022. (Tr. 67) Applicant\u2019s older brother \ncorroborated his testimony about his decision to stop drinking and the effect it had on \nhis behavior. (Tr. 98-100; 103-05) \nApplicant is receiving counseling from a therapist once a week, and he receives \nprescriptions from a nurse practitioner in the counselor\u2019s office. (Tr. 72, 83) In a report \ndated August 8, 2022, the nurse practitioner stated that Applicant had abstained from \nalcohol for ten weeks. Applicant receives prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety, \ndepressive disorder, and panic disorder. (AX J) He testified that he stopped taking \ndrugs for anxiety and panic attacks about a year ago. (Tr. 84) Although he was \nevaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he and his counselor have \ndetermined that he does not have PTSD. (Tr. 81, AX J \nApplicant attends AA meetings once or twice a month, but he has not found the \n\u201cright group.\u201d He testified that he has completed all of the 12-Step Program. (Tr. 74) He \nsees a therapist regularly, and he realizes the negative effect of alcohol on his life. (Tr. \n71-72) \nApplicant has become more active in his community and has started coaching \nbaseball.

The friend also \nstated that he did not observe any inappropriate interaction between Applicant and the \nneighbor\u2019s granddaughter.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nAG \u00b6 31(a) is established for some of Applicant\u2019s early traffic offenses, each of \nwhich, standing alone, would be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, \nbut when considered together show a pattern of irresponsible behavior. Applicant\u2019s \noverall criminal record establishes AG \u00b6 31(b), and his probation until November 2024, \nimposed for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, establishes AG \u00b6 31(c). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAlthough the conduct occurred almost four years ago, it was a continuation of a long \npattern of impulsive and irresponsible behavior. Applicant has been on probation and \nunder the pressure of retaining his security clearance since his arrest in August 2019. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established for the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.g, all of which were alcohol-related. Applicant stopped drinking for two years, from \n2014 to 2016, drank moderately until 2018, and stopped drinking in July 2022. He is \nhighly regarded by coworkers and supervisors for his technical expertise, dedication, \nand reliability. He is highly respected as a father by friends as neighbors, and he is \ninvolved in his community as a baseball coach. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the allegation of sexual battery alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. The alleged victim\u2019s credibility was judged by her grandfather as questionable, and \nthe alleged victim\u2019s accusation was undermined by her unsupported and incredible \nassertion that Applicant invited her to use cocaine. \nI have considered whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing that he did not sexually touch his neighbor\u2019s \ngranddaughter. The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA hearings \nand precludes applicants from contending that they did not engage in criminal acts for \nwhich they were convicted. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). \nThere are exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect to misdemeanor \nconvictions based on guilty pleas. Relying on federal case law, the Appeal Board has \nadopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral \nestoppel to misdemeanor convictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full \nand fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal trial. Second, the issues \npresented for collateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved against the \napplicant in the criminal trial. Third, the application of collateral estoppel must not result \nin \u201cunfairness,\u201d such as where the circumstances indicate lack of incentive to litigate the \nissues in the original trial. ISCR Case No. 04-05712, (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006).\n \n \nDepartment Counsel did not assert collateral estoppel during the hearing. \nApplicant was represented by counsel at his criminal trial and had an opportunity to fully \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlitigate the issues. His plea of guilty to assault and battery was a tactical decision, based \non advice of counsel, to avoid the possibility of a jail sentence. His conviction, based on \nhis guilty pleas, establishes only that he entered his neighbor\u2019s house without \npermission and touched the granddaughter. It does not establish that he fondled or \nkissed her on the night in question, that he groped her on the preceding day, or that he \ninvited her to \u201cdo some coke\u201d with him. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist \nin March 2022 and diagnosed with alcohol use, severe, in sustained remission, attention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation; and \nother specified personality disorder, with features of antisocial personality disorder. It \nalso alleges that the psychologist opined that his prognosis was uncertain because of \nhis lack of forthrightness during the evaluation. Finally, it alleges that the psychologist \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s personality condition could contribute to a lack of \ntrustworthiness in safeguarding national security information. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is partially established by the psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol use, \nsevere, in sustained remission. It is not established for the other psychological \nconditions alleged, because the psychologist suggested them as \u201cdiagnostic \npossibilities\u201d but stopped short of a formal diagnosis. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline may be applicable: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other \nguideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality \ncondition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, \nsuicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(b) are established by the psychologist\u2019s report and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. The psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use \ndisorder was in sustained remission, and this conclusion is supported by Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony as well as the testimony of family members, professional colleagues, \nneighbors and friends. The psychologist stopped short of a formal diagnosis of any \nother disorders, but Applicant admitted that he suffers from and receives treatment for \nADHD, anxiety, and panic disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or \ntreatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol use and impulsive behavior are \ncontrollable. He is receiving counseling and he is complying with his medication \nprogram. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) is not fully established. While Applicant has sought and obtained \ntreatment, he has not provided evidence of a favorable prognosis. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is established for his alcohol use disorder, which the psychologist \nfound to be in sustained remission. The psychologist declined to make a prognosis for \nApplicant\u2019s other behavior, in large part because he did not believe Applicant was \ntruthful. Unfortunately, the psychologist\u2019s belief that Applicant was untruthful was based \nin part on his own conclusions, unsupported by the evidence in the record, that \nApplicant was terminated from employment for making a racist comment and that he \nprobably was guilty of sexual misconduct with an 18-year-old young woman. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is not established.

His colleagues and supervisors have confidence in his \ntechnical skills and his apparent changes in behavior and attitude. However, he \nadmitted at the hearing that he still suffers from panic attacks and depression. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was under the influence of alcohol during the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and cross-alleges the conduct alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 2.a (SOR \u00b6 3.b). The concern under this guideline is set \nout in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress in a treatment program; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident \nwas in October 2011. Although it was alleged that Applicant was under the influence of \nalcohol when the incident in August 2019 occurred, that allegation was not supported by \nthe evidence. Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption when his son was born in \n2018, and he decided to totally abstain from alcohol in July 2022. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) is not established. Although Applicant is receiving regular counseling \nand treatment, it is focused on his behavioral disorders and not on alcohol consumption. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is established. Applicant was required to complete an alcohol-abuse \nprogram as a condition of his probation imposed in November 2019. He completed the \nprogram, modified his consumption, and has abstained from alcohol since July 2022. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nSOR \u00b6 4.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13(b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \nNo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are established. Applicant\u2019s plea \nof guilty was to assault and battery. He did not plead guilty to a sexual offense. The \nalleged victim\u2019s credibility was judged by her grandfather as questionable, and the \nalleged victim\u2019s accusation was undermined by her unsupported and incredible\nassertion that Applicant invited her to use cocaine. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment in June 2014 \nfor making an inappropriate comment to a coworker (SOR \u00b6 5.a), and that he was \nadministratively separated from the Navy with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions for misconduct (SOR \u00b6 5.b), and it cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g (SOR \u00b6 5.c). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d The \nfollowing disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior . . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \n16 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

The SOR alleges multiple incidents that \nare specifically covered by Guidelines J, I, and G that would be sufficient, if supported \nby substantial evidence, for an adverse determination. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and alcohol abuse, if \nknown, could affect his personal, professional, and community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(f) are established for Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nconduct. His last alcohol-related incident was in October 2011. He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption in 2018, when his son was born, and he decided to abstain from alcohol in \nJuly 2022. These mitigating conditions are also established for his discharge from the \nNavy, which occurred 21 years ago and was based on his alcohol-related conduct. They \nare not established for Applicant\u2019s impulsive and irresponsible behavior, including his \ntrespassing into his neighbor\u2019s home. Although the last incident was in August 2019, he \nis still on probation for that conduct. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is applicable to the allegation that Applicant was terminated from \nemployment in June 2014.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, I, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was \nsincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. He admitted his misconduct, except for the \nallegation of sexual behavior with the 18-year-old granddaughter of his former neighbor. \nBased on the testimony of the 18-year-old\u2019s grandfather and the unsupported \nsuggestion that Applicant was involved with cocaine, I found his denial of sexual contact \ncredible. \nHowever, I share the psychologist\u2019s concern that Applicant\u2019s past conduct and \npersonality raise concerns about future impulsive and irresponsible behavior. \u201cOnce a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). Applicant has not overcome that \npresumption. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines \nJ, I, G, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline G and refuted \nthe allegations under Guideline D, but he has not mitigated the security concerns under \nGuidelines J, I, and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I, (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 5, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 5.a and 5.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 5.c: \nAgainst Applicant as to \nSubparagraph 1.a; for \nApplicant as to \nsubparagraphs 1.b-1.g \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/16/2023 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation does not satisfactorily rebut the continuing \nsecurity concerns raised under the guideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 30, 2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain his security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On May 28, 2020, he provided a personal subject interview \n(PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue a security clearance, \nand issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 19, 2022, \ndetailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline F). The action \nwas taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided his answer on August 23, 2022. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2023, for a hearing \non June 30, 2023. The hearing was held by TEAMS video teleconference as scheduled. \nWithout objection, I entered the Government\u2019s seven exhibits (GE) 1-7 into the record. \nApplicant testified. He submitted two post-hearing exhibits (AE A-B) that were entered \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 13, 2023. \nThe record closed on July 21, 2023. \nRulings on Procedure  \nOn June 14, 2023, pursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.13 of DoD Directive 5220.6, the \nGovernment moved to amend the SOR by adding an additional guideline and three \nfactual allegations as follows: \n\u00b6 2. Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Three allegations under this guideline are: \n2.a. On about June 13, 2015, you were arrested in Baltimore County, \nMaryland and charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI). \n2.b. On or about September 26, 2015, you were arrested in Baltimore \nCounty, Maryland and charged with driving while under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI).  \n2.c. On or about April 23, 2023, you were arrested in Baltimore City, \nMaryland and charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI).  \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the amended SOR dated June 23, 2023, he admitted \nthe three allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c) under SOR \u00b6 2 (Alcohol Consumption), \nand provided his signature. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains 16 delinquent account allegations and two allegations of \nfailing to file federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2020. There are \nten student loan accounts, and the remaining accounts are commercial and one medical \naccount. The total amount of debt is about $70,841. Applicant admitted the delinquent \naccounts except SOR \u00b6 1.m, explaining that he was making payments to this collection \nagency.

The alcohol consumption \nallegations are supported by the state criminal record printouts (GE 6), the Defense \nInformation System for Security (DISS, GE 7), together with Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He has never been married. He received his high \nschool diploma in 2006. He has been living with a roommate since October 2019 (GE 1 \nat 25) \nAccording to his March 2020 security clearance application, Applicant has been \nemployed as a functional analyst since March 2020. From June 2019 to March 2020, he \nwas a floor manager. From October 2018 to June 2019, he held jobs in information \ntechnology. From September 2017 to October 2018, he was a site supervisor. From \nAugust 2006 to August 2017, Applicant was an Honor Guard Specialist in the State \nNational Guard and a clerk in the Army Guard Reserve. (GE 1 at 12-20) He provided \ninformation about his two DUI misdemeanor convictions in 2015 (GE 1 at 34-39) and \nnot filing his state tax returns for 2013 through 2020. He did not mention his missing \nfederal tax returns which he did not file for the same period. See GE 1 at 43. He \nrecalled being investigated for a security clearance while he was in the National Guard \n(2007 to 2015), and received a security clearance but does not recall when. (GE 1 at \n41) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when he \nstopped filing his income tax returns in 2013. He indicated that he could no longer afford \nto pay his tax preparer. He exacerbated his financial troubles by accumulating two DUI \noffenses in 2015, then one more in April 2023. (GE 2 at 6; GE 6; GE 7; Tr. 32-37) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a student loan account that was opened in 2008 and became \ndelinquent in March 2016. The other nine student loan accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, and 1 p) were opened about the same time and became delinquent \nin March 2016. (GE 3 at 12-14) Regarding the delinquent student loan accounts, \nApplicant testified that he was in discussions with lawyers who informed him that the \nschool (where he was receiving his education in 2008 and 2009) lost their accreditation. \nApplicant learned that the school was charging military personnel more than other \nenrollees. He implied that a large amount of time had passed since 2008 because he \nhad repeatedly placed the student loans in forbearance to allow him additional time to \naccumulate enough money to repay the loans. (Tr. 22-24) Since he opened the loan \naccounts, he has made approximately $100 in payments towards repayment of the \nloans.

(GE 3 13-14) In his March 2020 PSI, Applicant explained that the car \nwas stolen, and he was unable to retrieve the car from impound. He stated that he \nwould try to settle the account in September 2020. (GE 2 at 9) Applicant testified that \nthe account was still unpaid because he was trying to pay off his smaller accounts first. \n(Tr. 24) The only documented confirmation that Applicant paid off smaller accounts is \nsatisfaction of the AE A account. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is payday loan where Applicant used his car as collateral for a loan. \n(GE 2 at 7) The past-due debt became delinquent in July 2016. (GE 3 at 14; Tr. 48-49) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is an account for a car loan that was opened in 2015 and became \ndelinquent in August 2019. (GE 3 at 16) Applicant testified that he has taken no action \non this loan. (Tr. 24) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k represents an apartment rental account that became delinquent in \nMarch 2016. In March 2020, Applicant indicated to the investigative agent that his \nroommate lost his job and could not pay his portion of the rent. He planned to establish \na payment arrangement in July 2020. Applicant testified that he is still trying to obtain \nthe delinquent balance from his roommate. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 26) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m represents two credit-card accounts that belong to the same \ncreditor. Applicant mistakenly believed that the creditor had combined the accounts. (Tr. \n37) The documentation that shows that Applicant voluntarily paid off the first account in \nAugust 2022, because the account numbers of AE A match those of the May 2020 \ncredit bureau report (CBR). (GE 3 at 19) He provided information about the second \naccount which apparently shows that a judgment was taken against him, showing that \nhis wages have been garnished since January 2023 at $75 a month. As of the end of \nJune 2023, AE B indicates that Applicant still owed $455 on the second account. (Tr. \n37-38)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a medical account that became delinquent in July 2019. Applicant \nreceived medical treatment for his elbow, but did not have the insurance or money to \npay. He intended to set up a payment plan in August 2020 to pay off the debt. As of the \nJune 30, 2023 hearing, Applicant had taken no action to pay off the debt. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. \n26-27) \nEven though Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.r, claiming that he filed \nseveral tax returns, he provided no documentation, i.e., tax transcripts or processed tax \nreturns verifying that any federal or state returns were filed. (Tr. 32-37) Because there is \nno verification that returns were filed, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1r. are resolved against \nApplicant. With the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.m, I find the remaining delinquent accounts \nagainst Applicant as well. \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlcohol Consumption \nApplicant began using alcohol when he was 18 or 19 years old. (circa 2007) He \nbelieved he became intoxicated after two mixed drinks. He would usually drink on the \nweekends. \nIn June 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), Applicant was at a friend\u2019s house drinking, and \ndrove to pick up another friend at the bus station. He got lost and drove the wrong way \non a street. He was stopped by a police officer because of an expired emissions sticker. \nWhen Applicant told the officer that he had been drinking, he was given a breath test \nthat he failed. He was charged with DUI at the police station. Before his court \nappearance, he completed 10 to 15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and had \npoints taken away from his driver\u2019s license. He received probation before judgment. (GE \n2 at 4) \nWhile fulfilling the conditions of the June 2015 DUI, Applicant was arrested a \nsecond time for the same offense in September 2015. (SOR \u00b6 2b) He had consumed \none or two mixed drinks while celebrating the return of a friend from overseas. During \nhis drive to pick up his friend, he hit another car in the rear. Applicant failed the breath \ntest administered by a police officer and was arrested for DUI. When asked why he was \ndriving, Applicant replied, \u201cI was not thinking.\u201d (GE 2 at 4-5) He entered inpatient \ntreatment for three days; then he attended 26 weeks of AA. He received a certification \nfor the inpatient treatment and AA attendance. He returned to court on May 3, 2016, \nand received a 20-day sentence, which he completed by serving 10 weekends in jail. \nHe was put on probation for one year and his driver\u2019s license was suspended until \nFebruary 2017. (GE 2 at 4-5) \nOn the day before his arrest for DUI on April 23, 2023 (SOR \u00b6 2.c), Applicant \nwoke up early because he could not sleep. On the day of the arrest, he was at a friend\u2019s \nhouse watching a boxing match. He had consumed three or four mixed drinks. He left \nhis friend\u2019s house and started driving home. On his way, he got tired and decided to pull \nover on the berm of the road. Apparently, the road shoulder was wet and the car began \nto slide farther away from the road. Even though Applicant tried to correct the direction \nof the car, it eventually slid into a ditch. A police officer stopped and asked him to take a \nbreath test. Applicant refused. The officer took him to the police station and charged him \nwith DUI. (GE 7; Tr. 29-30) \nSince the April 2023 DUI, Applicant has resumed AA meetings every two \nweeks. He voluntarily installed an interlock device on his car. He is seeking therapy and \nwas referred to websites to fill out forms. He provided no documentation to support his \nefforts to get therapy. In a change of his lifestyle, he has not consumed any alcohol \nsince April 23, 2023, as he drinks water instead, and his intentions are to remain \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabstinent in the future. On July 24, 2023, Applicant was scheduled to return to court for \nfurther proceedings regarding the April 2023 arrest. (Tr. 41-45) \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use caused him to lose his driver\u2019s license for a year in \n2016, one of the terms of his sentence for the September 2015 DUI. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) (GE 2 \nat 5) He was separated from his State National Guard job in August 2017 for the SOR \u00b6 \n2.b DUI in September 2015, and he received a General Discharge from the National \nGuard in August 2017. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 50) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as \nrequired. \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The \nGovernment credit reports establish that all the debts listed in the SOR have been \ndelinquent since between March 2016 and July 2019. In March 2020, May 2020, April \n2022, and June 2023, Applicant was placed on notice that his financial delinquencies \nand his repeated failure to file his federal and state tax returns from 2013 through 2020 \nraised serious concerns to the Government. As of the close of the record on July 21, \n2023, the only documented account that Applicant paid was one account under SOR \u00b6 \n1.m. Though the other SOR \u00b6 1.m account became a judgment, followed by \ngarnishment of Appellant\u2019s wages. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s lack of documented action in addressing 15 of the remaining 16 \ndelinquent accounts listed in the SOR. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies based on the lack of \ndocumentation that indicates that Applicant has filed the missing federal and state tax \nreturns.  \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes more than $65,000 \nto 15 creditors or collection agencies. With no discernible changes in his financial \npractices, they will probably continue into the future. Applicant\u2019s failure to take \ncharge of his delinquent debt responsibilities continues to raise doubts about his \nreliability and judgment. \nNo mitigation is available for Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(b). He has had \nuninterrupted employment since 2007. When he stopped filing his federal and state tax \nreturns in 2013, he was working as an Honor Guard with the State National Guard and \nhe was also employed as an Army clerk for the Guard. He may not have been paid the \nlevel of wages that he was entitled, but he should have made the appropriate \nadjustments to his finances so he could continue to dutifully file his tax returns as \nrequired under the United States (US) Tax Code, while handling his other delinquent \ndebts. By not acting responsibly under the circumstances to address his financial \nissues, AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot be applied under these circumstances. \nWhen an applicant is having problems in paying his debts in a timely manner, \nhe should seek help through some kind of financial counseling. Based on the lack of \nfinancial counseling or evidence of a written budget to monitor his earnings and \nexpenditures, both the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c) must be removed from \nfavorable consideration. Fifteen of Applicant\u2019s 16 delinquent debts are not being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant is not engaged \nin a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. Though Applicant is paying off the second \ncreditor through garnishment, at least the creditor is receiving some reimbursement for \nhaving initially advanced him credit in good faith. SOR \u00b6 1.m is found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nAlcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns of the guideline for alcohol consumption are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.  \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nBetween 2015 and April 2023, Applicant was convicted of three DUI offenses. \nBefore each of the three alcohol-related incidents, Applicant had consumed up to three \nmixed drinks. During the first incident in June 2015, Applicant became lost and found \nhimself driving the wrong way. Initially, he was stopped for an expired emissions sticker. \nWhile he was completing the terms of his sentence for the first DUI, after consuming at \nleast two mixed drinks, Applicant struck another car from behind in September 2015. He \nwas arrested and charged with DUI. In April 2023, while consuming three mixed drinks \nas he was watching a boxing match at a friend\u2019s house, Applicant decided to drive \nhome. Feeling too tired to continue his trip, he stopped on the side of the road. Not \nrealizing how far off the road he was, his efforts to get the car in a more stable position \nwere futile and the car slid into a ditch. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies because of the three alcohol-\nrelated incidents. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies because of the impaired judgment which Applicant \nexhibited in the three alcohol-related incidents, even though there has been no \ndiagnosis of an alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply because less than four months has passed since \nApplicant\u2019s most recent DUI. The alcohol-related incident did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances because it had happened on two previous occasions. Applicant lost his \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndriver\u2019s license for a year following his second DUI in September 2015. In August 2017, \nhe received a General Discharge from the Maryland National Guard as a result of his \nsecond DUI in September 2015. The recency of the April 2023 alcohol-related incident \ncontinues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) does not apply. Though Applicant testified that he has been \nabstinent since his April 2023 DUI arrest, he has failed to convince me that he has \ndiscontinued his alcohol consumption. He has presented insufficient evidence \ndemonstrating changed circumstances conducive of an alcohol-free lifestyle. His \ncommitment to AA is minimal. While he indicates he has been investigating therapy, he \nis still not enrolled in any program. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish his case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed \nin the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and \nhas taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has no plan in place \nand has furnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on 15 of the 16 past due \naccounts. After a full review of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of \nview, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems have not been mitigated.  \nApplicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption guideline either. After \ncommitting a second DUI in September 2015 under essentially the same circumstances \nas his June 2015 DUI, and having lost his license for a year, and being required to \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nseparate from the National Guard in August 2017 with a General Discharge, Applicant \nshould have taken the necessary steps to prevent the same kind of event from \nrecurring. However, he faces the same negative outcome when he is sentenced for the \nlatest April 2023 DUI. Judging by the totality of the circumstances, Applicant has not \novercome the ongoing security concerns arising from the guidelines for financial \nconsiderations and alcohol consumption. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 2, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on May 1, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6 1.a and 2.a. He denied the SOR \nallegation in \u00b6 1.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2000 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. He married in 1993 and has two children, ages 30 and 28. He \nhas worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since January 2017. \nThe SOR alleges delinquent student loans (\u00b6 1.a $43,614) and a delinquent credit \ncard (\u00b6 1.b $1,586) that are substantiated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in the SOR, during \nhis interview with a government investigator, and credit reports from January 2021 and \nFebruary 2023. (Items 3, 5, 6, 9) \nIn August 2021, based on information obtained through the DOD Continuous \nEvaluation Program, DOD sent Applicant\u2019s employer a supplemental information request, \nrequiring Applicant to complete a current Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP). He completed it in August 2021. (Item 6) \nSection 26 of the e-QIP asked if Applicant, in the past seven years, had defaulted \non any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; or had been \nover 120 delinquent on any debt not previously included in the e-QIP. He responded \u201cno\u201d \nto all those questions. (Item 4) \nIn September 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. \nWhen asked if he had any debts in collection, he responded that he did not. He was then \nconfronted with collection accounts for student loans and a credit card. He explained to \nthe investigator that he had no knowledge of the debts, and his wife handled all of the \nfinances. He did acknowledge that he opened a student loan account in his name for the \nbenefit of his daughter with the Department of Education. He was given an opportunity to \nprovide additional documents and information after he spoke with his wife. He was also \ngiven a financial worksheet to complete. (Item 5) \nApplicant contacted the investigator the next day by email and stated he and his \nwife did not feel they needed to complete the financial worksheet because they are not at \nfault.

However, the creditor received an email from \nApplicant on November 14, 2017, to continue the process of consolidation. Applicant\u2019s \napplication was reinstated effective November 15, 2017, and the creditor disbursed the \nfunds on November 22, 2017.

(AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s February 2023 credit report reflects that he had several student loans \nthat were acquired from 2011 through 2013. Applicant made payments on these loans \nand then in November 2017 they were refinanced. It appears this is when they were also \nconsolidated. After that time, it appears he may have made some payments, but it is \nunclear. He did not provide any information on payments he previously made or why he \nmay have changed the status of the loan. At some point, he stopped paying them and \nthey went to collection. (Item 9) \nRegarding the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, in Applicant\u2019s subsequent email to \nthe investigator after his September 2021 interview, he stated that he had paid the creditor \n$5,000, and he and his wife did not agree with the interest that was charged, believing it \nwas an overcharge. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided a copy of an email from October \n2018 that he sent to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He told the creditor that the amount of \ninterest charged was incorrect and that he had previously contacted them in December \n2017 requesting a corrected statement, but his request was ignored.

He said the interest rate agreement was for 9.9% and he was \ncharged up to 15%. No documents were provided. His credit report from February 2023 \nreflects the debt has been delinquent since January 2018 and remains unpaid. (AE A) \nApplicant stated in his FORM response that he was willing to repay the student \nloan, (Sugg. I think \u201cloan debt\u201d is a bit redundant.) but the payments have been paused \ndue to the pandemic. He stated he intended to start repayment when the program \nreopens. (AE E) \nApplicant provided an email from November 2022 from Miguel Cardona, U.S. \nSecretary of Education regarding the student loan debt relief program and noted that \nApplicant was eligible for relief. However, the legality of program was challenged. He may \nbe eligible under a new program. If approved, part of Applicant\u2019s student loans will be \ndischarged. (AE F) \nApplicant provided a DOE email noting that the pause on payments for student \nloans was extended through the end of June 2023 so those who qualified for debt relief \nwould not have to make payments when their loans may be forgiven. (AE G) \nApplicant provided a letter in his FORM response from his wife stating he does not \nknow anything about their finances. She handles all financial matters. (AE E) He stated: \nSince in the past to on August 2021, I did not know any financial in family. \nMy wife, [LL], she took care and handled anything in finance. Until \ninvestigator my security clearance let me know about the debts. (AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans and a credit card debt totaling \napproximately $45,200 that he has been aware of since at least 2018 and has not paid. \nAlthough, he may dispute the consolidation of the loans, the evidence is clear that the \nmoney from the student loan creditor was disbursed and presumably used for Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter\u2019s education. He refused to provide any information about his finances to make \na determination if he was unable to pay his debts. There is no evidence either debt is \npaid. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant provided a series of statements about the student loans that were \nconsolidated in 2017. He admitted the debt in his SOR answer; however it appears he \nhas an ongoing dispute about the loans, but the specifics of the dispute are unclear. He \nfailed to provide sufficient documents to substantiate why he is not responsible for the \ndebt. He provided a letter from the creditor clearly spelling out the timeline and his failure \nto act within the time requirements. He did not provide substantiating documents to show \nthe borrower could cancel if there was \u201cnot a good option.\u201d It is unclear what the statement \nmeans or where it came from. He did not provide any evidence of actions he has taken \nto pay this debt since becoming aware it was a security concern in 2021. He did provide \nthat he has applied for student loan debt relief, and if the program is implemented then \nhis \u201capproved debt\u201d would be discharged. He did not provide evidence of the amount of \nhis approved debt. However, it appears that the maximum amount under the program \nwould be $20,000. He said that he intended to pay his student loans when the forbearance \nis over. \nApplicant denied he owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Although, he stated he was \novercharged for interest, he did not provide any documents to show what the contractually \nagreed upon interest rate was, proof that he paid $5,000 to the creditor, or how long the \ndebt was delinquent. He provided a 2018 email he sent to the creditor advising them he \ndisputed the interest rate and told them to not contact him again. There is no evidence he \nhas contacted the creditor and resolved or satisfactorily disputed the debt. It remains on \nhis 2023 credit report. \nApplicant may rely on a potential student loan debt relief program to address a \nportion of his delinquent loans, but his failure to act upon them before they went to \ncollection or take any meaningful action since becoming aware they are a security \nconcerns raises questions about whether future behavior is unlikely to recur. I am not \nconvinced it will not recur and find his conduct casts doubt on his reliability and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant participated in financial counseling. He refused to \ncomplete a financial worksheet reflecting his current financial obligations and assets, so \nthe evidence is insufficient to conclude that there are clear indications his finances are \nunder control or his financial problems are being resolved. There is no evidence he has \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay the creditors. \nApplicant admitted the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a but then provided a series of \nstatements regarding the validity of the loan. He filed a complaint, but the specific \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallegations are unclear. What is clear is that he received a disbursement for over $43,000 \nand the debt is in collection. He did not provide a reasonable basis of a legitimate dispute \nor actions to resolve it. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant denied and disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided a document he \nsent to the creditor in 2018 that said he did not agree with the interest that was charged \nand told the creditor to stop contacting him. He failed to contact the creditor and resolve \nthe debt. He did not provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of his dispute. \nHe did not provide a copy of his agreement with the creditor with the interest rate, or proof \nthat he paid $5,000 and that satisfied the debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to this debt. \nInsufficient evidence was provided to apply any of the other mitigating conditions. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, which alleged he intentionally falsified his response \nto section 26 of the e-QIP which asked if he had any debts in collection. In his FORM \nresponse, he said his wife handles all financial matters and he did not know about the \ndebts. \nApplicant provided documentation that he was involved in communicating with the \nDOE and the credit-card creditor. He applied for a student loan consolidation through \nDOE and communicated to them regarding the possibility of canceling the loan and then \nsubsequently filed a complaint regarding the loan. He also provided a document that \nreflected he contacted the credit-card creditor regarding the interest that was being \ncharged on his account. He acknowledged that he had received and reviewed \ncommunications from the creditor and told them not to contact him again. Applicant was \nactively handling and disputing the accounts in the SOR. I did not find Applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nstatements credible and find he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts in his \ne-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not correct his response to the e-QIP. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator and denied he had any delinquent debts. AG 17(a) does not \napply. Failing to be honest on an e-QIP is not minor. The cornerstone of the security \nclearance process is that the Government trusts those who are granted security \nclearances to be honest and self-report issues or conduct even when no one is looking. \nApplicant failed to do that. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation to support his claims. He failed \nto meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On January 12, 2023, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA \nCAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), D (Sexual Behavior), G (Alcohol Consumption), \nand E (Personal Conduct).

Department Counsel was ready \nto proceed with the hearing on April 17, 2023. The case was assigned to me on April 19, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing on April 24, 2023, scheduling the hearing for June 27, 2023. The \ncase was heard as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered 13 exhibits marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf and submitted 29 exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through\nCC. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. The day after the hearing,\nApplicant submitted a request to reopen the record to permit him to submit documents in\nresponse to an issue that arose during the hearing. Department Counsel objected to this\nrequest. In an email identified as Hearing Exhibit (Hearing Ex.) I, I overruled the objection\nand granted Applicant the opportunity to submit additional proposed exhibits on or before\nJuly 5, 2023. I granted Department Counsel the opportunity to object to or comment on\nany additional proposed exhibits submitted by Applicant. (Hearing Transcript at 11.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn June 30, 2023, Applicant submitted five proposed exhibits, marked for \nidentification purposes as AE DD through HH. Department Counsel objected to the \nproposed exhibits on the grounds of relevance. The documents are news and journal \narticles that were unrelated to any of the specific SOR allegations but related more \ngenerally to an issue raised by Applicant during the hearing. My evidentiary ruling on the \nAE DD through HH is discussed below. The correspondence relating to Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission has been marked as Hearing Ex. II through IV. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 5, 2023, and the record closed on that date. (Tr. at \n9-19, 64-65; Hearing Ex. II through IV.) \nEvidentiary Ruling \nAs stated, Department Counsel objected to the admission of AE DD through HH. \nThe proposed exhibits consist of two news articles (AE DD and EE), two articles that \nappeared in university publications (AE GG and HH), and a privately funded report that \nwas published on an internet website (AE FF) (collectively referred to as the Publications). \nApplicant has not requested that I take administrative notice of the facts appearing in the \nPublications. Instead, he offers the Publications as evidence. Department Counsel \ncorrectly notes that as evidence, the articles bear little relevance to the particular facts in \nthis case. None of the Publications discuss Applicant\u2019s arrest in March 2019 for assault \nand resisting arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.a), any of the charges that were prosecuted in Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2012 court-martial (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e), or his arrest for abusive sexual conduct \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b).

(AE DD through HH.) \nThe facts found below under SOR \u00b6 1.a include Applicant\u2019s unusual behavior in \nfailing to cooperate with the police when questioned about an alleged altercation with a \nride-share driver. In his testimony about the incident, Applicant made a reference to police \nviolence in the United States when arresting minorities as a justification for his refusal to \ncooperate and his resisting arrest. At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was motivated by fear for his safety. (Tr. at 53, 64.) For that reason, \nI overrule the Government\u2019s objection and admit the Publications as evidence in this case. \nI will give these exhibits the weight that they deserve in the context of all of the other \nevidence presented. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 33 years old. He has never married, but he is presently engaged. He \nhas no children. He attended a U.S. military academy (the Academy) from June 2009 to \nNovember 2011. He played football at the Academy. He was dismissed from the \nAcademy before he had earned a degree. In April 2017, he completed his undergraduate \ncourses and received a bachelor\u2019s degree at another university. He also earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in October 2020. He has worked as an engineer since 2017, most \nrecently as a systems engineer for a U.S. Government contractor. He seeks national \nsecurity eligibility in connection with his employment. He was denied eligibility by another \ngovernment agency in March 2021, one month before he submitted the e-QIP. (Tr. at 12-\n13, 40; GE 1 at 7, 14-20, 30, 62-64; GE 6 at 4.)   \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted \u201cwith clarifications\u201d each of the five allegations \nunder this guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to \nthe matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR: \n1.a. March 2019 Arrest for Attempted Assault, Resisting Arrest, Obstruction of a \nPolice Officer, and Assault or Battery. Applicant engaged in a dispute with a driver from \na ride-share company (the Driver) after a night in a bar with friends. Applicant and his \nfriends were arguing with each other over where the Driver should go first. The Driver \npulled over and asked the occupants to get out of his car. Applicant got out of the car and \nproceeded to punch the Driver in his left cheek with a closed fist through the open window. \nApplicant and his friends entered a nearby hotel. The Driver called the police, and upon \narrival at the scene, the police interviewed the Driver. He provided the police with a \ndescription of Applicant\u2019s assault and advised that Applicant and his friends had entered \na hotel across the street. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he punched the \nDriver in the face. He also claimed it was the Driver who was being aggressive, and it \nwas Applicant who demanded the Driver to pull over and let the group leave the car so \nthey could find another ride to their homes.

The police attempted to question Applicant about the dispute. Applicant declined to \nrespond, even refusing to provide his name and identification card. He testified at the \nDOHA hearing that he was unaware that he was required to provide his name and \nidentification to the police. The police asked Applicant to provide his side of the story \nregarding his interactions with the Driver. He refused to speak and told his friends to \u201cshut \nup.\u201d The police further advised Applicant that he would not be allowed to leave without \nproperly identifying himself. He again refused. At the hearing, Applicant justified his lack \nof cooperation with the police by testifying \u201cthere was a lot of racial things going on in the \nnation, and I didn\u2019t want to be involved or be one of them.\u201d He also claimed he was \nunaware of the reason why the police were asking him questions. He was placed under \narrest for assaulting the Driver. He continued to refuse police orders and actively refused \nto put his hands behind his back so that he could be handcuffed. He was so strong that \nthe police could not undo his grip on his hands in front of him. He continued to resist all \ninstructions from the police, even after being told he would be pepper sprayed in the face \nif he did not cooperate. He was then pepper sprayed and handcuffed with his hands \nbehind his back. He refused to walk to the police vehicle, and due to his large size, four \npolice officers had to carry him to the vehicle. He further resisted the officers attempt to \nhave him sit in the vehicle. Instead, he laid on the back seat with his feet hanging outside \nthe door preventing it from closing. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE \n4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.) \nThe police determined that based upon the Driver\u2019s statement regarding the \nincident that they had probable cause to arrest Applicant for assault. They also concluded \nthat they had probable cause to arrest him for resisting arrest/obstructing a police officer. \nHe was charged with those two misdemeanor offenses. Applicant\u2019s version of the incident \nwith the Driver was unpersuasive, and his demeanor throughout his testimony regarding \nhis interaction with the police further undercut the credibility of his testimony. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was totally at odds with his stated concern about the police \noverreacting and using excessive force against him. In reality, his behavior reflected his \nabuse of alcohol that evening, which would explain why the criminal trial judge ordered \nApplicant to abstain from consuming alcohol for 90 days as part of his agreement to \ndismiss the charges. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at \n1-10.) \n1.b. January 2013 Arrest for Abusive Sexual Conduct in Violation of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 120. On or about May 14, 2011, Applicant, others \nfrom the Academy, and a female civilian (the Civilian) were together drinking alcohol at a \nnight club. The group then went to a hotel room to continue drinking alcohol. The Civilian \nwas intoxicated and laid down on a bed in the room. She then fell asleep. When Applicant \nand the Civilian were later alone in the room, Applicant laid down on the bed next to The \nCivilian and touch her genitals through her underwear. The Civilian awoke and told him \nto stop several times, which he did briefly. He continued to arouse himself against her \nbody and eventually ejaculated.

In June 2012, Applicant was court-martialed for the conduct set forth in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He was charged with violating Articles 80, 120, and 128 of the \nUCMJ, and he was convicted on the specifications relating to the incidents alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Applicant was sentenced to dismissal from the service, six months of \nconfinement, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. A punitive dismissal is the legal \nterm for the dishonorable discharge of an officer or academy cadet. He appealed and his \nconviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals for his branch of the military. He \nwas dismissed from the Academy. (Tr. at 21-22, 44; GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7; GE 8; GE 12.) \n1.d. December 2011 Arrest for Wrongful Sexual Contact in violation of UCMJ \nArticle 120. In November 2011, Applicant was investigated for a sexual assault involving \na female classmate (the Classmate) that occurred in about March 2011 in Applicant\u2019s \ndorm room at the Academy. He, two male classmates, and the Classmate spent several \nhours drinking alcohol and playing cards late at night. He met the Classmate for the first \ntime that evening. The Classmate became intoxicated and vomited. She fell asleep on \nthe bed of Applicant\u2019s roommate. The male classmates left the room to return to their \nrooms, leaving Applicant alone with the Classmate, who was asleep. Applicant was highly \nintoxicated. Applicant pulled his pants and underwear down to midthigh. The Classmate \nfelt Applicant entering the bed in which she was sleeping and lie behind her, pressing his \nbody against hers. He then took her hand and rubbed it against his genitals. After a few \nseconds, she was coherent enough to realize what Applicant was doing and pulled her \nhand away. She then vomited again. He claimed at the DOHA hearing that he stopped \nhis sexual actions when she told him to stop. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that \nhe was wrong to make the Classmate feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Applicant was charged and \nconvicted of Wrongful Sexual Conduct in violation of Article 120 of the UCMJ. His \nconviction was upheld on appeal. Applicant did not acknowledge that his conduct was \ncriminal. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-46, 50-51; GE 7 at 3; GE 9 at 2, 8.) \n1.e. November 2011 Arrest for Assault by Battery and Attempted Sexual Contact \nin violation of Articles 128 and 120, respectively, of the UCMJ. After a night of drinking \nalcohol at a bar in November 2011, Applicant returned to the Academy campus with \nfriends from the Academy, including a former classmate (FC) who had passed out in the \nbathroom of the bar. FC had no memory of what happened after she passed out. \nApplicant and his friends carried FC to a dormitory room. The classmates left Applicant \nand FC alone in the room, and he locked the door. The classmates returned and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndemanded that Applicant open the door.

The classmates \nfound FC unresponsive with her jeans unbuttoned unzipped and her shirt pulled up to \nchest level. An ambulance was called, and FC was taken to a hospital. In the investigation \nof the incident, Applicant denied that he touched FC, but claimed he was too intoxicated \nto be certain. He admitted that he kissed her earlier in the evening while she was \nincoherent. His overall version of the events that evening developed in the investigation \nsignificantly differed in critical details from the appellate court\u2019s recitation of the facts \ndeveloped at the court-martial. At one point, Applicant provided a statement in which he \nacknowledged getting into bed with FC, who was passed out. He commented that \u201cI \nstrongly believe its possible\u201d that he unbuttoned FC\u2019s jeans, \u201cbut I am not 100% sure \nbecause I cannot recall those events.\u201d At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied he kissed \nFC and he otherwise did not recall what he did with FC that evening. Applicant was \ncharged and convicted of punching both classmates and choking one of them. Applicant \nwas also charged with and convicted of unwanted sexual conduct with FC, including \nkissing her when she was incoherent. His convictions under UCMJ Articles 80 and 128 \nwere upheld on appeal. See SOR \u00b6 1.c, infra.

The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters \nalleged in paragraph 2 of the SOR: \n2.a. The SOR cross alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e under Guideline D in this \nsubparagraph. \n2.b. Current registration as a Sex Offender in State 1. Applicant was required to \nregister as a Sex Offender as a result of his court-martial convictions. He registered in \nState 1 on June 22, 2012, and his registration requirement expires on June 22, 2027. He \nclaimed at the hearing that, due to a change in the laws of State 1, he was eligible to have \nhis name removed from the registration list at that time. (Tr. at 25, 57; GE 3 at 7.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this \nguideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters \nalleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR: \n3.a. Alcohol Consumption during the period October 2011 to at least March 2019. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR was preceded by \nhis significant use of alcohol resulting in his intoxication. At the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that he, at times, consumed alcohol in excess during the period alleged, but not \nduring the entire period.

April 2019 Alcohol Counseling. Applicant testified that he was ordered, by the \ncourt in the criminal case arising from his March 2019 arrest, to abstain from drinking \nalcohol for 90 days. He stated that he complied with this court order. Applicant claimed \nthat his participation in the counseling class was voluntary and that he completed the \ncounseling. In a letter addressed to Applicant\u2019s criminal defense attorney, dated April 29, \n2019, the alcohol counselor wrote that Applicant \u201cappeared to accept responsibility for his \nbehavior [on the day of his March 2019 arrest.]\u201d The counselor noted that Applicant had \ndecided to abstain from any further use of alcohol effective the night of his arrest. \nApplicant attended four individual counseling sessions. This letter was submitted to the \ncourt. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant testified that he no longer drinks alcohol to the \nextent he used to drink before his 2019 arrest. He refined his comment about his drinking \nhabits to say that he only consumes alcohol on rare occasions, such as at a wedding. \n(Answer at 6; Tr. at 26-27, 33-34, 56; AE A.) \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the single allegation under this \nguideline. The SOR cross alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e under Guideline E in this \nparagraph. \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable \nwhole-person assessment. I have carefully reviewed all of the evidence and note the \nfollowing specific items: \nApplicant provided a written statement of his intent to modify his drinking habits \nand attend counseling. He also wrote that he understood that any inappropriate future \ninvolvement with alcohol may be grounds for the revocation of his national security \neligibility, if granted to him. Applicant provided no evidence of any alcohol counseling or \ntreatment subsequent to the four sessions in March and April 2019. \nIn addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters. A former classmate \nat the Academy wrote a letter prior to Applicant\u2019s 2019 arrest praising Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination and perseverance to reach his goal of becoming an engineer.\u201d He also \nwrote that he has been impressed by Applicant\u2019s \u201cunwavering devotion to overcoming his \npast.\u201d In an undated letter, Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend praised his character and \u201cability \nto be respectful.\u201d She commented that Applicant \u201cdid not allow his past to determine who \nhe is, and it is not an accurate reflection of what he will be in life.\u201d A friend of ten years \nwrote that Applicant is passionate and determined to reach his goals. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e \nwrote two letters that were submitted into the record. In her most recent letter, she \ncommented that the couple recently purchased a home. She wrote that Applicant was \ncompletely transparent before they began their dating relationship about his past \nproblems that are the subject of the SOR allegations. She also confirmed that Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nno longer abuses alcohol. She describes Applicant as \u201ca respected member of his \ncommunity, both personally and professionally.\u201d A longtime close friend also praised \nApplicant\u2019s outgoing personality and willingness to help others. This friend also \ncommented on Applicant\u2019s perseverance. (AE F at 3-5; AE S; AE BB at 1-3.) \nApplicant also submitted a lengthy letter from a licensed clinical social worker (the \nLCSW), who described the incidents leading up to Applicant\u2019s court-martial and provided \nher analysis of Applicant\u2019s qualifications under the adjudicative guidelines for Alcohol \nConsumption and Sexual Behavior. Her recitation of the facts was sometimes at odds \nwith the facts set forth in the official records submitted by the Government. Her version of \nthe facts was generally quite favorable to Applicant, minimizing the seriousness of his \nactions. Applicant specifically denied to the LCSW that he had ever \u201cengaged in any \nsexual assault.\u201d Also, he only reported to the LCSW one incident at the Academy and \nadvised her that he had \u201cblacked out\u201d after excessive alcohol consumption and did not \nrecall the details of the incident, which occurred in November 2011 and is the basis for \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The LCSW wrote in her letter that despite his court-martial \nconviction and the adverse decision on appeal, Applicant still maintains that he is innocent \nof all of the charges. She wrote that the accusations against him were \u201cunfounded.\u201d She \nexplained in another part of her letter that Applicant believes he was set up by a classmate \nwho was acting as a confidential informant. The LCSW concluded that despite Applicant\u2019s \nhistory, he has \u201cno probability of sexual addiction\u201d or \u201calcohol use disorder.\u201d He also \ndenied to the LCSW that he assaulted the Driver in 2019. (AE P at 3-8.) \nThe LCSW also reported that according to Applicant he has never engaged in any \nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol. He advised the LCSW that, as of the date of his \nNovember 2021 interview with her, he drinks alcohol two to four times a month and drinks \nthree to four drinks when he does consume alcohol. (AE P at 5, 8.) \nApplicant also submitted evidence of his community involvement, specifically with \nan orphanage founded by his parents in the country of his birth. He is a member of the \nBoard and assists with fundraising, among other activities. (AE H, AE Y, AE Z.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes the following three conditions that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nThe record evidence established all three disqualifying conditions. With respect to \nthe allegations under SOR \u00b6 1.b, the evidence of the sexual assault discussed above \nsatisfies the substantial evidence standard applicable in this case, even though Applicant \nwas found not guilty of these specifications at the court-martial under the more stringent \nevidentiary standard applicable in a criminal case under the UCMJ. The offense was \nreported to the law enforcement authorities the next day and the victim, the Civilian, went \nto the hospital where physical evidence was collected against him. This evidence and the \nevidence presented that addressed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through 1.e, which includes his \ncourt-martial conviction and resulting dismissal from the Armed Forces, shift the burden \nto Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \nThe guideline includes the following two conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish either of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant has a history of criminal conduct that began in 2011 and \nmost recently occurred in 2019. In light of that pattern of criminal behavior, insufficient \ntime has passed to permit a conclusion that similar behavior is unlikely to recur. Moreover, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthat pattern of behavior still creates serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant has produced some evidence of rehabilitation. He has earned two \ndegrees and has been employed by U.S. Government contractors. He has also provided \nevidence of constructive community involvement. More importantly, however, he has not \nshown any significant contrition, either to the females he wrongfully assaulted under \ncircumstances where he knew the women were so intoxicated and/or unconscious that \nthey had no reasonable opportunity to participate willingly or to object. He also has denied \npunching the Driver, and he has expressed no regret for failing to comply with the \nlegitimate instructions from the police officers, especially after he was placed under arrest. \nApplicant\u2019s active resistance directly conflicts with his purported concerns about \nexcessive force by law enforcement. Rather, Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and casts doubt on his ability to comply with laws and rules. The absence of \nany credible evidence of contrition on Applicant\u2019s part for his criminal conduct \nsubstantially undercuts his evidence of rehabilitation under this mitigating condition. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant.  \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for sexual behavior are set out in \nAG \u00b6 12, which states: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes the following three conditions that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence supports the application of all of the above conditions. \nApplicant repeatedly engaged in criminal sexual behavior. His history, and ongoing denial \nof culpability, make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. His sexual \nbehavior with a very intoxicated woman in his dorm room was of a public nature since his \nclassmates descended on him once they determined what he had done behind a locked \ndoor. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects a serious lack of judgment, even though \nsome of it might not be considered to have been \u201cof a public nature.\u201d \nThe guideline includes the following two conditions in AG \u00b6 14 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant refuses to accept responsibility for his actions. He denied to the LCSW \nthat he ever committed any sexual assaults, notwithstanding his court-martial conviction, \nwhich was upheld on appeal. His evidence in mitigation is insufficient to permit a \nconclusion that his past behavior is unlikely to recur. His past actions combined with his \nongoing denials cast doubt of his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) has not been established. \nState 1 requires that Applicant register as a sex offender so that the public is aware \nof the potential danger he represents. His registration, however, somewhat reduces the \npotential for coercion, exploitation, or duress. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 14(c) has some \napplication. Overall, however, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish mitigation \nof security concerns created by the pattern of criminal sexual behavior developed by the \nrecord evidence. \nParagraph 3 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes the following two conditions that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe record evidence supports the application of these conditions. Applicant has \nexperienced numerous incidents in which his excessive alcohol consumption and binge \ndrinking contributed to his criminal conduct and impaired judgment. This evidence shifts \nthe burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \nThe guideline includes the following four conditions in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n. \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s problematic alcohol consumption was frequent and happened under \nsuch circumstances that it might recur. As commented below, it is apparent that he is not \njust drinking alcohol on rare occasions as he asserts. Also, his alcohol consumption casts \ncontinuing doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n23(a) was not established. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e assert that he no longer abuses alcohol. However, there \nis limited evidence in the record demonstrating a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption. At the hearing, Applicant testified that currently he rarely drinks alcohol \u2013 \nfor example, when he attends a wedding or special occasion. In a more credible \nstatement, Applicant advised the LCSW in 2021 that he typically drank three to four \nglasses of alcohol two to four times a month. Moreover, there is no evidence that he has \nmodified his consumption of alcohol in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s four classes of alcohol counseling in April 2019 are insufficient to qualify as \nalcohol treatment. The record contains no evidence that Applicant has ever had any \nongoing treatment to help him prevent future abuse of alcohol. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n23(b) has not been established. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever participated in alcohol treatment other \nthan four counseling sessions in March-April 2019. AG \u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) are not \napplicable. Overall, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish mitigation under this \nguideline. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 4 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 sets forth the following condition that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nSOR \u00b6 4.a is merely an additional cross-allegation under Guideline E of conduct \nalready alleged under Guideline J. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established, as it requires \u201ccredible \nadverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline. . . .\u201d The personal conduct general \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcern (AG \u00b6 15) and the whole-person analysis below are established, given that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct evidences his questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. However, since the conduct is \nfully addressed under other guidelines, as discussed above, I consider the personal \nconduct cross-allegation to be duplicative, and I find SOR \u00b6 4(a) for Applicant solely on \nthat basis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of facts established under the guidelines alleged in the SOR and \nthe whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, D, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. Further comments are \nwarranted. The overall impression that Applicant established is that he is young man with \na difficult past to explain. Instead of sincerely owning what he has done and establishing \nthe ways that he has matured or otherwise changed, he has minimized his past \nmisconduct, first with the LCSW and then at the hearing. For instance, he regrets that he \nmade a woman feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with his sexual advances without admitting that he \nsexually assaulted her and committed a crime in doing so. Similarly, he deflects \nresponsibility by arguing that he was too intoxicated to recall the events of a second \nsexual assault. He expressed no regret for his excessive drinking that night. The events \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s 2019 arrest show that his pattern of problematic alcohol \nconsumption, questionable judgment, and criminal behavior has persisted in his post-\nAcademy civilian life. Applicant has not provided credible evidence to show he has \nachieved the necessary maturity or experienced sufficient personal growth to correct his \npast behavior, particularly under the influence of alcohol.

In the state where Applicant was \narrested the term \u201cwet reckless\u201d refers to a DUI charge that was reduced based on a \nplea agreement and the offense involved alcohol.1 Applicant stated that he was \nconfused how to report his DUI offense. He did not think he had to report it because he \nwas not convicted. He said even though he marked \u201cno\u201d on his 2007 SCA regarding an \nalcohol offense that he wrote a letter to the federal government before he submitted his \nclearance application, and he made the government aware of his charge. He did not \nprovide a copy of the letter or other corroborating evidence. He said that part of the \ncontents of the letter are included in his comments that are noted above and were \nincluded in the SCA. He testified that he was not trying to mislead the government. \nAlthough the charge of DUI may have been reduced, the \u201cwet and reckless\u201d charge \ninvolved alcohol, which the SCA specifically asked, and he did not disclose. (Tr. 22-35, \n53-64) \nIn 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He did not report his \narrest to his facility security officer (FSO) or employer. He said he was unaware that he \nwas required to report the arrest because he held a clearance and thought he only had \nto report a conviction. When arrested he refused to take a breathalyzer because his \nattorney had previously advised him not to because the machine is inaccurate. This \ncase was eventually nolle prosed. He was unsure why the charge was not prosecuted. \nHe admitted he had consumed alcohol before the arrest. He failed the field sobriety test, \nand he told the police officer that he had consumed two beers and two shots of alcohol \nforty-five minutes before his arrest. During his May 2019 background interview, he \ndenied he consumed any alcohol. At his hearing, he said he likely had more than one \ndrink hours before his arrest. (Tr. 35-38, 49, 74-80; GE 3, 9; AE B, C) \nIn 2017, Applicant completed another SCA. Section 22 asked if in the last seven \nyears he had been arrested by a police officer, sheriff, marshal of any other law \nenforcement official. He responded \u201cno.\u201d It also asked if he had EVER been charged \nwith an offense involving alcohol or drugs. He responded \u201cno.\u201d He did not disclose his \nMay 2000 DUI arrest or later reduced \u201cwet and reckless\u201d charge or his September 2013 \nDUI arrest and charge. He again testified that these were not reported as required \nbecause they had been dismissed and there was nothing to report, and he thought they \nwent away.

He told the investigator that he did not report his prior \narrests on his 2017 SCA due to an oversight and because all of this information had \nbeen previously provided over the years and was provided during his initial security \ninvestigation and 10-year renewal process. He reiterated this explanation in his \ninterrogatories. He admitted he had been drinking when he was arrested in 2000. \nApplicant testified that when he was specifically asked about his previous arrests, he \ndisclosed them to the investigator. He did not otherwise because he thought he only \nhad to disclose convictions. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 68-73; GE \n3) \nIn February 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He said he did not think he \nhad to report it to his employer if it was dismissed. He testified that he reported this DUI \nto his employer after it was dismissed. He said that at this point he learned that he was \nrequired to report his arrests. He said he thought if the case went away, he would not \nhave to report it. (Tr. 80-86; GE 3, 4, 8) \nThe police report for his February 2019 arrest reflects Applicant\u2019s car was parked \nhalf on the pavement and half on a grassy area with its hazard lights on. Applicant was \nslumped in the seat and the car was running. The police officer could not conduct a field \nsobriety test because Applicant was too intoxicated. He testified he does not know what \nhe was doing at the time. He refused to take a breathalyzer. During a December 2021 \ninterview with a government investigator, Applicant said he entered a pretrial diversion \n(PTD) program and over a seven-to-eight-month period, he was required to be tested \nfor alcohol consumption. He was also required to attend an alcohol awareness class \nthrough Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Applicant testified that after going through the PTD \nprogram, this was the first time he thought he might have an alcohol problem. Applicant \ncontinued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 80-87; GE 4, 8) \nIn May 2019, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator and \nasked he if had ever been arrested or charged with an alcohol-related offense. The \ninvestigator indicated Applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d Applicant disputes that and said he told \nthe investigator he had been charged but not convicted. In this interview they discussed \nhis 2013 DUI arrest. He denied he had been drinking. This contradicts the police report \nand his testimony. He disclosed to the investigator he had also been arrested in \nFebruary 2019 and charged with DUI. At the time of the interview, the charges had not \nbeen adjudicated. He admitted to the investigator that he had been consuming alcohol \nprior to his arrest. He said this type of incident was unlikely to recur because he does \nnot drink and drive. (Tr. 88-90; GE 3) \nApplicant did not disclose his May 2000 or September 2013 arrests and charges \nfor DUI or \u201cwet reckless\u201d or any alcohol related offenses in his 2007 or 2017 SCA.

Question 2 \nasked: Have you consumed any alcohol since January 2019. He responded \u201cno.\u201d At his \nhearing, he testified that he did consume alcohol after that date. As noted, he was \narrested in February 2019 and charged with DUI. (Tr. 87-90; GE 4) \nIn response to the June 2019 interrogatories, Applicant wrote: \nI do not consider myself as a heavy drinker or an irresponsible drink[er]. I \nam not an alcoholic, nor do I drink on a[n] everyday or every month basics \n[sic]. I have never been convicted of DUI or for having a drinking issue. \n(GE 4) \nIn June 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found \npassed out at the wheel of his car while sitting at a traffic light. He took a breathalyzer \ntest at the scene and recorded a .24% BAC. The police offered to take him to the \nhospital because he was so intoxicated. Applicant testified he was not feeling well and \nhad taken some cold medicine. Once at the police station, he refused to take another \nbreathalyzer. Applicant was convicted of DUI. He was ordered to pay a fine and \nsentenced to 365 days in jail, suspended; and attend a highway intoxication seminar. \nApplicant admitted he was driving while intoxicated. According to the employer\u2019s \ndocuments, in October 2020, Applicant informed them he was arrested on August 21, \n2020, for DUI. Applicant testified that his June 2000 conviction was appealed and was \nsent to the circuit court where he was approved to participate in a PTD program. (Tr. 90-\n106; GE 5, 7, 11; AE E) \nIn January 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. It is unclear if he \nwas still participating in a PTD program from his June 2020 DUI charge. He told the \npolice he had consumed two beers. He failed a field sobriety test and recorded a .11% \nBAC. Applicant disputed the accuracy of the BAC saying it took numerous attempts to \ncomplete it. The police officer noted that Applicant had trouble following simple \ninstructions. Applicant does not believe he was intoxicated or impaired. He admitted he \nhad a few beers. His case was adjudicated in a PTD program. He continued to drink \nafter his January 2021 arrest. He testified that he last consumed alcohol in July 2021. \nHe said he realized he needed to stop drinking alcohol. (Tr. 106-118; GE 3, 6, 12; AE E, \nG, I) \nThe requirements of this PTD program were to complete a 12-week 36 session \nalcohol rehabilitation class, be tested for alcohol consumption, and perform community \nservice. Applicant went to court ordered AA but did not resume when the PTD program \nended. He successfully completed the alcohol rehabilitation class and found it very \nhelpful.

(GE \n3) \nApplicant testified that he did not report the first four DUI arrests to his employer until \n2020 when he became aware of the requirement to do so because he held a security \nclearance. He reported his 2021 DUI. He explained he did not report the pre-2020 \ncharges because he believed if the charge was dismissed the case was resolved, and \nhe was not required to report it. (Tr. 53-58) \nApplicant testified that he was a social drinker. He would not drink at home alone. \nHe did not realize for a period that he might have an alcohol problem. His mistake was \ndrinking and driving. He stated the alcohol class he was required to take as part of his \nlast PTD was very helpful. He took responsibility for his conduct. He believes he is not a \nthreat to national security and can be trusted. (Tr. 40-46) \nApplicant admitted he is an alcoholic. He testified that he no longer consumes \nalcohol. He does not have the urge to drink. He does not go to clubs. He used to drink \non the weekends and admitted he would occasionally drive after consuming alcohol. His \ncousin is a recovering alcoholic and acted as his sponsor while he was attending the \ncourt-ordered classes. He still has regular contact with his cousin. (Tr. 127-132) \nThe chief executive officer (CEO) of the rehabilitation center that Applicant \nattended testified on his behalf. He described him as an excellent participant who \nhelped others and followed all of the rules. He never missed a session. He believes \nApplicant is in recovery. After Applicant completed the course, he would return \nperiodically. The CEO explained that anyone in recovery can relapse, but Applicant has \nbeen sober for about two years.

(AE J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

He responded \u201cno.\u201d I did not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations credible throughout his hearing and find he deliberately failed \nto disclose he was arrested for DUI and although the charge was reduced to \u201cwet and \nreckless\u201d this was still an alcohol-related offense required to be disclosed on his SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2017 SCA asked if in the last seven years he had received \na notice to appear in a court proceeding; if he had been arrested by any police officer or \nlaw enforcement official; and if he had been charged, convicted, or sentenced for a \ncrime in any court. He responded \u201cno.\u201d Applicant was arrested for DUI in 2013. I did not \nfind his explanations credible and find he deliberately failed to disclose this alcohol-\nrelated offense. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2017 SCA asked him about other offenses that were not \npreviously disclosed and if he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol \nor drugs. He responded \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose his May 2000 DUI charge or his 2013 \nDUI charge. \nApplicant disputes that during his November 2018 interview with a government \ninvestigator that he failed to disclose his May 2000 and September 2013 DUI charges. I \nfind there is some question as to whether Applicant volunteered the information about \nthe May 2000 DUI arrest or if the disclosure only came after he was confronted with the \ninformation. I find the evidence is insufficient to conclude he provided false information \nabout the May 2000 DUI charged and conclude in his favor that part of the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 2.e. \nRegarding disclosing to the government investigator information about his \nSeptember 2013 DUI charge, the evidence supports he did not disclose this information \nduring the November 2018 interview. This information was later disclosed during his \nMay 2019 interview. I did not find Applicant\u2019s explanations credible and believe he \ndeliberately failed to disclose his September 2013 DUI charge during his November \n2018 subject interview. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI did not find Applicant credible that he believed he did not have to disclose his \narrests and charges because he was not convicted. He was originally charged with DUI \nin May 2000. That charge was reduced to \u201cwet and reckless\u201d which is an alcohol-related \noffense that should have been disclosed. Applicant makes no mention in his SCA that \nthis offense involved alcohol. He specifically checked the \u201cother\u201d box instead of the box \nindicating the offense involved alcohol. \nApplicant\u2019s five DUI arrests and charges were cross-alleged under the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct guidelines. There is sufficient evidence to apply AG \n\u00b616(e) to his conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant prove mitigation. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying security \nconcerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect his omissions or falsifications made when completing his SCA or statements \nmade to the government investigator. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s omissions and falsification are not minor. I did not find his explanation \nthat he believed he only had to disclose convictions on his SCA credible. He clearly was \nconvicted of the May 2000 criminal offense that was alcohol-related yet still did not \ndisclose it. His omissions and falsification are serious and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in May 2020, September 2013, \nFebruary 2019, June 2020, and January 2021.

The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nAs noted above in the personal conduct guideline analysis, I have concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s candor and credibility. Applicant was involved in five alcohol-related \nincidents. After his 2021 DUI arrest and charge, he was ordered to attend AA and \nparticipate and complete a substance abuse and treatment program. He did so \nsuccessfully. Applicant testified that he has not consumed alcohol since July 2021. He \npreviously stated that he did not intend to be involved in any further alcohol-related \nincidents and had stated in interrogatories that he had not consumed alcohol after \nJanuary 2019 when he actually did and was arrested again in February 2019 for DUI. \nApplicant acknowledged he is an alcoholic. He testified he talks to his cousin who \nis also an alcoholic, and he is his sponsor. However, he has not attended AA since he \ncompleted the mandatory requirement by the court, and it is unknown if his cousin is \naffiliated with AA or another substance abuse program. The CEO of the rehabilitation \nand treatment center where Applicant attended stated that he occasionally stops by and \nis very helpful to others. A counselor who evaluated Applicant believes he is at low risk \nfor relapse. There is evidence that he acknowledges his pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse. Applicant has a 20-year history of alcohol issues. He recently acknowledged he \nhas an alcohol problem but there is limited corroboration as to him being involved in a \nstructured support system. In the past, he has not been honest about his alcohol use. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDespite some evidence of mitigation, I cannot find that sufficient time has passed to \nconclude future behavior is unlikely to recur. I find AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant is currently participating in \ncounseling or treatment. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. Although, \nApplicant stated he has not consumed any alcohol since July 2021, based on his long \nhistory of alcohol use, numerous alcohol-related incidents, and credibility issues, \ndespite some evidence of mitigation, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the security \nconcerns raised. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) have minimal application. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was arrested and charged five times for DUI. The evidence supports \nthat he consumed alcohol before he was arrested. Some charges were reduced or \ndismissed, and others were adjudicated through PTD programs. The above \ndisqualifying conditions applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has been charged five times with DUI from 2000 to 2021. Although, he \nwas not convicted, he was repeatedly arrested for driving after he had consumed \nalcohol. His conduct raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The same analysis under Guideline G, alcohol consumption and \nGuideline E, personal conduct security concerns apply under this analysis. Although, \nthere is some evidence that Applicant may no longer be consuming alcohol, it is too \nsoon to conclude that future criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. I find the above \nmitigating conditions have some application, but they are insufficient to fully mitigate the \ncriminal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concern arising under the personal conduct, alcohol consumption, and criminal \nconduct guidelines. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant (excepting \n \u201c1.a\u201d) \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G.

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 31, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2023. The \nhearing convened as scheduled on October 27, 2023. \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and 8 through 10 were admitted in \nevidence without objection.

The objection to AE C was overruled, and it was admitted in evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is on unpaid \nleave pending the outcome of this adjudication. He attended college for a period without \nearning a degree. He married in 2006, divorced in 2009, married for the second time in \n2015, and divorced in 2018. He lives with a cohabitant in what he describes as a \ncommon-law marriage. He has three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17-21, 60-61; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from August 2007 until he was honorably \ndischarged for medical reasons in August 2008. He testified that he served \u201c[a] little \nshort of two years.\u201d His DD-214 indicates that he served 11 months and 23 days. (Tr. at \n19; AE A) \nApplicant was still in a training command in March 2008 because of his medical \nissues. Two soldiers reported that Applicant attempted to sell them ecstasy (3, 4 \nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), an illegal controlled substance. One of the \nsoldiers stated that he overheard Applicant tell a soldier that he had two more to sell. \nApplicant then asked the soldier if he wanted some ecstasy. The soldier said, \u201chell no,\u201d \nand reported the incident to the sergeant first class on duty. (Tr. at 20, 41-42; GE 1, 7) \nThe duty sergeant confronted Applicant, read him his rights, and asked him to \nempty his pockets and his wallet. The sergeant found two pills inside a plastic wrapper \nin Applicant\u2019s wallet that were later determined to be MDMA. The sergeant asked \nApplicant what the pills were, and he answered ecstasy. A Criminal Investigation \nCommand (CID) investigation was initiated in 2008. Applicant waived his right to remain \nsilent and provided a sworn statement. (GE 7) \nIn the sworn statement to the CID, Applicant stated that there was a song on that \nwas about ecstasy, and he asked the soldiers if either had used ecstasy before, but he \ndenied selling or attempting to sell ecstasy. He stated that he obtained the two pills in \nJanuary 2008 while at a strip club. Someone at the club traded Applicant the two pills \nfor some beers. The individual said the pills were some kind of medication but did not \nsay what medication. Applicant stated that he assumed they were some kind of pain \npills. Applicant placed the pills in his wallet, where they were later discovered in March \n2008 by the duty sergeant. Applicant specifically stated that he only received two pills, \nand he never took any of the pills. He was given a urinalysis drug test that day, which \ntested positive for MDMA. (GE 7) \nThe CID referred the investigation to Applicant\u2019s command for the offenses of \nwrongful possession of hallucinogens with intent to distribute, wrongful use of \nhallucinogens, and false official statement.

I note that the CID reported that he was an E-2 in March 2008, and his DD-\n214 reported that he was an E-1 when he was discharged. (GE 7) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2021. The \ninterview was summarized in a report of investigation (ROI). Applicant confirmed the \naccuracy of the ROI in August 2022. He admitted during the interview that several \nsoldiers reported that he was selling ecstasy to soldiers. He stated that people lied, that \nthe military was a hostile environment, and he was not liked. He stated that he never \ntried to sell drugs, and a drug was never obtained in the incident. (GE 2) \nApplicant provided a slightly different story during his testimony. He denied \nknowledge that the pills were ecstasy, and he denied trying to sell the pills to other \nsoldiers. He stated that he received three pills in the strip club, and he took one for a \nheadache, thinking it was pain medication. He stated that he forgot he had the pills in \nhis wallet. He did not recall if he was given a urinalysis drug test, and he did not recall \nbeing informed that he tested positive for ecstasy or MDMA. (Tr. at 41-46) \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find the CID report to be far more reliable. I find \nApplicant knowingly used ecstasy, had at least two ecstasy pills that he tried to sell, and \ntested positive for MDMA. I further find that he intentionally provided false information \nabout the incident to CID (false official statement), during his 2021 background \ninterview, and during his testimony. \nApplicant was driving with his two-year old child in a child seat in May 2019 when \nhe was stopped by the police for defective tail lamps. He voluntarily gave the police \nconsent to search his vehicle. The police discovered under the driver\u2019s side seat a \ncanister of white powder that was later identified through analysis to be about three \ngrams of methamphetamine. A small backpack was on the floor by the front \npassenger\u2019s seat. There was a canister with suspected methamphetamine residue in \nthe backpack. A glass pipe of the type that is commonly used to smoke drugs was also \nin the backpack. Small clear baggies were found in the driver\u2019s side door and in the \nbackpack. (Tr. at 32-41; GE 8) \nWhen he was arrested, the police discovered two small clear baggies with \nmethamphetamine residue in his right front pocket and a container with .1 gram of \nmethamphetamine in his left front pocket. A med-kit with multiple containers of \nsuspected THC oil was found under the passenger seat. Possession of marijuana or \nTHC was not a violation of state law. (GE 8) \nApplicant was charged with possession of a controlled substance for the \nmethamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia. In June 2019, a warrant was \nissued for his failure to appear at a court date, and he was arrested. He stated that he \nhad moved and did not receive notice of the court date. In October 2019, he pleaded \nguilty to possession of a controlled substance, and the other charges were dismissed. \nHe was sentenced to supervised probation for two years, completion of a substance \nabuse evaluation with the requirement to follow any recommendations, and community \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nservice. He passed multiple drug tests between May and December 2019.

(Tr. at 36, 46-49; GE \n6, 8-10; AE E) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJune 2021. He reported the May 2019 arrest and subsequent conviction for possession \nof a controlled substance. He denied illegally using any illegal drugs or controlled \nsubstances in the last seven years. (GE 1) \nWhen he was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2021, \nApplicant stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car when he \nwas \narrested \nin \nMay \n2019. \nHe \ndenied \nknowingly \nusing \nor \npossessing \nmethamphetamine. He stated that he let someone else use his vehicle, and the person \nmust have left the drugs in his car without his knowledge. He stated that he did not \nknow the friend\u2019s name, and he no longer associated with him. He also told the \ninvestigator that the June 2019 arrests for failure to appear were for the same incident. \n(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he was going through a difficult time in his marriage, and \nhe used methamphetamine on one occasion before his arrest. He admitted that he had \nbaggies in his pocket that were from when he used methamphetamine. He continued to \ndeny that he knew there was methamphetamine in his vehicle. He stated he lent the \nvehicle to the friend he used methamphetamine with, and that person must have left the \nmethamphetamine in the vehicle. He denied any additional drug involvement. He stated \nthat he took responsibility for his bad decision to use methamphetamine, and he \ndisassociated himself from anyone involved in illegal drugs. (Tr. at 32-40; AE E) \nApplicant denied being untruthful during his 2021 background interview. He \ntestified that he did not mention to the investigator that baggies were found in his pocket \nbecause he did not remember that fact. (Tr. at 40-41, 49-50, 59; GE 2) \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find he knowingly possessed and used \nmethamphetamine. I further find that he intentionally provided false information when he \nfailed to list his use of methamphetamine on his SF 86, during his 2021 background \ninterview when he stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car \nand he denied knowingly using or possessing methamphetamine, and during his \ntestimony. \nThe SOR alleges a $3,069 collection account to a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $483 \ncollection account to a telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and a balance of \n$16,364 due on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant \nadmitted owing the first two debts, but he stated that he paid the auto debt. The debts \nare listed on one or more credit reports. Applicant did not report any financial issues \nwhen he submitted his June 2021 SF 86, even though all the debts were delinquent by \nthen.

He stated that he tried to get the \nring back from her after they separated, but she told him that she lost the ring. He was \nunable to get her to pay the account, so he unsuccessfully disputed it with the credit \nreporting agencies. He stated that he then did not have the ability to pay the debt. In \nOctober 2023, he agreed to make partial payments of $100 a month for seven months, \nwith the first payment due on October 20, 2023. He testified that he made the first \npayment, but he did not provide any documentary evidence. (Tr. at 21-24; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B) \nApplicant stated that the $483 collection account to a telecommunications \ncompany (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was for equipment that he returned, but the company did not \nhave records that it was returned. He stated that if he was given a receipt for the \nreturned equipment, he no longer has it. He unsuccessfully disputed the debt with the \ncredit reporting agencies. He has decided to pay the debt. (Tr. at 24-26; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges an unpaid balance of $16,364 due on an auto loan after the \nvehicle was repossessed. Applicant testified that the vehicle developed transmission \nproblems, and he was told he needed a new transmission. He had an extended \nwarranty on the vehicle, but the holder of the warranty told him that he did not need a \nnew transmission. He stopped paying the loan, and the vehicle was repossessed. The \nvehicle was auctioned, and the creditor waived any deficiency, resulting in a $0 balance. \nDuring his background interview in July 2021, he stated that he bought a more \nexpensive vehicle than he could afford, he missed payments, and the vehicle was \nrepossessed. He never mentioned transmission problems. (Tr. at 26-30; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5; AE C, D) \nApplicant stated that his finances are now in order. He stated that he intends to \npay the remaining SOR debts. (Tr. at 21-32, 58) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his work ethic, expertise, \ntrustworthiness, professionalism, commitment to the mission, craftsmanship, dedication, \nleadership, reliability, and integrity. He is recommended for a security clearance.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nWhile in the U.S. military in 2008, Applicant possessed, used, and tested positive \nfor MDMA, a controlled substance also known as ecstasy. He had methamphetamine \nand drug paraphernalia in his possession when he was arrested in May 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(b), and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant was still in training in 2008. I am confident he was not granted access \nto classified information at the time. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not applicable. The language in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b that alleges \u201cwhile granted access to classified information\u201d is concluded for \nApplicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant denied knowingly taking ecstasy, and he denied knowledge that the \npills in his possession in 2008 were ecstasy. He testified that he was going through a \ndifficult time in his marriage, and he used methamphetamine on one occasion before his \n2019 arrest. He denied knowing that there was methamphetamine in his vehicle. He \ndenied any additional drug involvement, and he passed multiple drug tests between \nMay and December 2019. He stated that he took responsibility for his bad decision to \nuse methamphetamine, and he disassociated himself from anyone involved in illegal \ndrugs. \nAs addressed in the findings of fact. I did not find Applicant credible about either \nincident. He knowingly used ecstasy, had at least two ecstasy pills that he tried to sell, \nand tested positive for MDMA in 2008. He knowingly had methamphetamine in his \nvehicle in 2019. He intentionally provided false information about the 2008 incident to \nCID (false official statement), during his 2021 background interview, and during his \ntestimony, and he intentionally provided false information about the 2019 incident during \nhis 2021 background interview, and during his testimony. \nSince I cannot trust anything Applicant says, I also cannot find that illegal drug \ninvolvement is unlikely to recur. His drug involvement continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s illegal drug incidents under criminal conduct, \nand it also alleges his arrest for failure to appear. AG \u00b6 31(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to appear is plausible, reasonable, and \naccepted. SOR \u00b6 3.a is mitigated. His explanations for his drug incidents are not \nplausible nor reasonable. The analysis under Guideline H applies equally here. His \ncriminal conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above \nmitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those \nconcerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant intentionally provided a false statement in 2008 when he denied taking \nany of the ecstasy pills. He intentionally provided false information during his 2021 \nbackground \ninterview \nwhen \nhe \nstated \nthat \nhe \nwas \nunaware \nthere \nwas \nmethamphetamine in his car during his arrest in May 2019. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable to \nboth false statements. \nSOR \u00b6 4.c alleges that Applicant intentionally provided false information during \nhis 2021 background interview when he stated the June 2019 arrests for failure to \nappear were for the same incident. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that it was \nan intentionally false statement. AG \u00b6 16(b) is not applicable to that statement. SOR \u00b6 \n4.c is concluded for Applicant.  \nSOR \u00b6 4.d cross-alleges the drug involvement and criminal conduct as personal \nconduct. Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe drug involvement and substance misuse and the criminal conduct guidelines. \nHowever, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated under the same analyses \naddressed above under Guidelines H and J. Additionally, having determined that \nApplicant intentionally provided false information in an attempt to mislead the \ngovernment, I have also determined that his testimony about those statements was also \nfalse. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.1 \n1 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \n \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant defaulted on an auto loan, a consumer loan, and payments to a \ntelecommunications company. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nApplicant stated that the $3,069 collection account to a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was \nused to buy an engagement ring for his second wife. She refused to return the ring after \nthey separated, and she told him that she lost the ring. He unsuccessfully disputed it \nwith the credit reporting agencies. There is some precedent for a fianc\u00e9e to return an \nengagement ring if the marriage does not take place, but in general once there is a \nmarriage, the ring belongs to the wife. Moreover, even if there was a legitimate dispute, \nthat would be between Applicant and his wife, not Applicant and the bank. He was \nunwilling to satisfy the debt regardless of the ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(b) is applicable to \nthat debt. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant testified that the vehicle had transmission problems, and his warranty \nwas not honored. He told a different story to the background investigator in 2021. In \neither event, the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt is resolved and mitigated. \nThe remaining two debts only total about $3,500. That would not be a significant \namount from a security perspective if I could accept Applicant\u2019s assertions that he would \npay the debts. I cannot. In October 2023, he agreed to make partial payments of $100 a \nmonth for seven months for the debt for the ring, with the first payment due on October \n20, 2023. He testified that he made the first payment, but he did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after \nhaving been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). His \nstated intentions to pay the two debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record \nof debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay the remaining two SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that \nhis financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to \npay the debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. However, he has multiple drug \noffenses, and he cannot be trusted to tell the truth. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E, F, H, and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant) \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 10, 2021, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On November 8, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) submitted some interrogatories to him asking some questions pertaining to his \nfederal income return filings. He responded to those interrogatories on February 28, 2022. \nOn June 2, 2022, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators \nwere unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \nOn September 21, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 21, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on October 31, 2022. His response was due on November 30, 2022. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of December 19, 2022, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. The record closed on \nNovember 30, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). He did not \naddress the allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and his failure to do \nso is registered as a denial. \nBackground \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a production technician since he was employed in October 2020. He was previously \nemployed by other employers as a master builder (March 2016 until October 2020), and \nlaborer (June 2015 until January 2016). He is a 2015 high school graduate. He has never \nserved with the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance. As of May \n2021, he was engaged but never married. He has three children, born in 2015, 2019, and \n2021. \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported that in his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax \nreturns he \u201cfound discrepancies and a 1040X form will be filed and the difference will be \npaid upon request.\u201d (Item 3 at 34) On June 15, 2021, he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, \nApplicant admitted that he intentionally withheld some of his income on his income tax \nreturns, and that he was never caught. However, when he looked online and saw the \npossible consequences for lying on his income tax returns he decided to rectify the \nproblem. He reportedly addressed the 2018 income tax return with the assistance of a \nprofessional tax preparation company and submitted it to the Internal Revenue Service \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(IRS) in October 2020. He estimated that he owed the IRS approximately $2,900 and was \nwaiting to hear from them in order to set up a payment plan. He acknowledged that he \nhad not taken any steps to correct his 2019 federal income tax return because he had \nbeen waiting to have a stable job before doing so. He explained that he lied because he \nsaw everyone else getting tax refunds and he wanted the money in order to pay off a few \nthings. He was only 21 and 22 years old at the time and admittedly not mature. (Item 3 at \n7) \nIn his answers to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he had made \nimmature and undoubtedly poor decisions to withhold a portion of his income on his 2018 \nand 2019 federal income tax returns. Although he claimed that he had filed the Forms \n1040X for both years, he failed to submit any documentation to support his claim, despite \nbeing asked to do so. His only submission was for a request for a transcript of tax returns \nfor the two years in question, dated February 28, 2022. (Item 4 at 3-4, 6) \nThe SOR alleged two still unresolved issues involving intentionally filing fraudulent \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, as well two still delinquent \naccounts for unpaid income taxes for those two tax years amounting to approximately \n$6,500. In addition, there is the cross-allegation under personal conduct covering the \nidentical facts. \nIn his Response to the SOR, Applicant admitted intentionally filing fraudulent \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019 by failing to report his total \nincome for those two years, and that he owed the amounts alleged. He offered \u201cno \njustified explanation\u201d for his actions, but commented that his immaturity led him to be \nuntrustworthy. He claimed that he has already paid the IRS $3,000 towards the 2019 \ntaxes, but did not submit any documentation to verify his claim. He acknowledged the \nfederal income tax form for 2018 had not yet been processed by the IRS. (Item 2 at 1-2) \nApplicant did not report his net monthly income, his monthly household expenses, \nor any monthly debt payments. In the absence of such information, I am unable to \ndetermine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. There is a \npaucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems are now under control, and it is \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income   \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as  \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he had intentionally and \nfraudulently filed false federal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, and \nthat he was still indebted to the IRS for approximately $6,500 in unpaid income tax for \nthose two years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. As for AG \u00b6 19(b), \nthere is evidence that his actions were to enable him to keep some money to pay off bills, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand that is sufficient evidence to establish an unwillingness to satisfy his debts regardless \nof an ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(b) has also been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the conditions applies. As noted above, Applicant admitted that he had \nintentionally and fraudulently filed false federal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 \nand 2019, and that he was still indebted to the IRS for approximately $6,500 in unpaid \nincome tax for those two years. He offered \u201cno justified explanation\u201d for his actions, but \ncommented that his immaturity led him to be untrustworthy. Moreover, other than a \ngeneral statement about filing one of the amended income tax returns, and paying the \nIRS $3,000 towards the 2019 taxes, he did not submit any documentation to verify his \nclaims regarding any corrective actions that he might have already taken. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

He has not acted responsibly by failing to address his \ndelinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with the IRS. \nThe Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 20/18); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any verified evidence that he has even begun making such \nefforts. \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously; nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current \nfinancial information. Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s financial considerations are adopted herein. \nApplicant admitted that he had intentionally and fraudulently filed false federal income tax \nreturns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, and that he was still indebted to the IRS for \napproximately $6,500 in unpaid income tax for those two years. He offered \u201cno justified \nexplanation\u201d for his actions, but commented that his immaturity led him to be \nuntrustworthy. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions support a conclusion that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) \nhave been established. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s initial acknowledgements were made to the OPM investigator in \nJune 2021, the issues related to his finances and personal conduct continue unresolved \nto this day. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(a) has not been \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nproduction technician since he was employed in October 2020. He was previously \nemployed by other employers as a master builder and laborer. In his SF 86, he reported \nthat he \u201cfound discrepancies\u201d in his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax returns, and in \nJune 2021, he told an OPM that he intentionally withheld some of his income on his \nincome tax returns, and that he was never caught. He gets some credit for initially \nidentifying his financial problem. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant admitted that he had intentionally and fraudulently \nfiled false federal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, and that he was \nstill indebted to the IRS for approximately $6,500 in unpaid income tax for those two years. \nHis comments to the OPM investigator were not fully accurate, for his income tax returns \ndid not merely contain \u201cdiscrepancies,\u201d they contained intentionally false information. \nOther than general statements about contacting the IRS, making payments on his \ndelinquent income taxes, and filing an amended income tax return for one of the years in \nquestion, Applicant failed to submit any verifiable evidence in support of his claimed \nactions. There are lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve his financial and \npersonal conduct issues, the lengthy period of non-contact with the IRS, and his failure \nto be candid about his delinquent debts when he completed the SF 86, is negative and \ndisappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.

He did not recall signing for the \ntwo defaulted student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), but he acknowledged they were his \nresponsibility. He thought the $1,046 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to a collection company was for \na medical debt, but the original creditor was actually a bank. (Items 1, 3-6) \nBefore the SOR was issued, Applicant paid, settled, or brought current several \ndebts that were not alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence of any payments toward \nthe SOR debts. He stated that he intended to pay his debts. He and his wife are doing \nmuch better career wise, and they are more mature. His parents both served more than \n20 years in the U.S. military, and Applicant asserted that he would never do anything to \nbetray his country.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment and raising two young children. His employment issues were largely \nbeyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant paid, settled, or brought current several non-SOR debts before the \nSOR was issued, which is a step in the right direction. There is no evidence of any \npayments toward the SOR debts. He stated that he intends to pay his debts. However, \nintentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11\u00ad\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant may reach a point where his finances warrant a security clearance, but \nhe has not established that he is there yet. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d There is insufficient evidence for a determination that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable \nto find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith \neffort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \npartially applicable, but none of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These debt delinquencies warrant \nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial considerations \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts with explanations require no independent\nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing. \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited limited resources as a one-income family played some role in \nhis accrual of so many delinquent debts over the past few years. Considering these \nadded financial burdens, mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. However, with his steady work over the past 10 years, he could be reasonably \nexpected to make more progress in addressing his delinquent accounts. \nFinancial advice offered by the lawyers Applicant has consulted does not enable \nhim to avert responsibility for addressing his debts with voluntary, good-faith payments \nof his creditors holding delinquent accounts. Deferring to creditors to pursue \nenforcement measures or relying on controlling statutes of limitation in his state of \nresidence to render the debts unenforceable do not represent the kind of voluntary, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                               \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ngood-faith efforts required to mitigate financial concerns.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about November 2015 to July 2021, to include after being granted access to classified information and that he had been arrested and charged with marijuana possession in September 2020. Applicant is a 24-year-old software engineer, never married, and has no children. He earned a bachelor's degree in August 2020 and has been employed by a defense contractor since August 2020. He received a security clearance in April 2020 and executed a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) two weeks later. (FORM Item 5.) When Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2020, he disclosed that he used marijuana from about November 2015 until December 2019. He did not answer the question on his SCA regarding the nature of use, frequency, and number of times used, and simply listed \u201crecently stopped\u201d on the line provided for the question. (FORM Item 3 at 23.)

He received a security clearance in April 2020 and \nexecuted a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) two weeks later. (FORM Item 5.) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2020, he disclosed that he used \nmarijuana from about November 2015 until December 2019. He did not answer the \nquestion on his SCA regarding the nature of use, frequency, and number of times used, \nand simply listed \u201crecently stopped\u201d on the line provided for the question. (FORM Item 3 \nat 23.) In response to the request in the SCA, for an explanation on why he intended or \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future, he responded, \u201cCan hinder me from obtain \n[sic] security clearance and jobs in the future.\u201d \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, he listed \u201csocially\u201d in the Frequency of Use \nbox. (FORM Item 4 at 8.) During his enhanced subject interview (ESI) conducted in \nNovember 2021, and authenticated by him in June 2022, he disclosed he had been \ncharged and pled guilty to possession of marijuana in September 2020. (FORM Item 4 at \n6.) He also admitted in his ESI to using marijuana in July 2021 on two occasions and \nacknowledged he still associates with people with whom he used marijuana.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n Analysis \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25(a): \n\u201cany substance misuse (see above definition).\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use did not occur \nunder circumstances making recurrence unlikely. He acknowledged his marijuana use in \nhis SCA and in his response to the FORM, but he continued his use of marijuana after \ncompleting his SCA and signing his NDA after being granted a security clearance. He \nstarted using marijuana in 2015, when he was 18, and has continued to use it until 2021. \nHe did not answer the question on the frequency of his use. He continues to associate \nwith those with whom he used marijuana. His actions after completing his SCA and \nreceiving his security clearance are indicative that not enough time has passed. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       Subparagraphs 1.a-b:  \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-term use of marijuana in violation of federal law raises questions \nabout his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. He has not \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse and acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security. Because he requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Based on the \ntotality of the evidence, I am not convinced that he will continue his abstinence from \nmarijuana use once the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance is removed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. at 29.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. At 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence admitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d, and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d. \nApplicant accrued delinquent debts, during a period of unemployment or \nunderemployment and while going through a divorce. The following mitigating conditions \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant's delinquent debts occurred as she was \ndealing with a failing marriage and leaving the military. These are circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur. She has established her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \nby providing evidence that all the debts are being paid off on a regular monthly basis or \nresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant's debts occurred due to circumstances \nbeyond her control. Her documentation corroborates her marital issues. She has \ndemonstrated that she has acted responsibly under the circumstances by taking her \nincrease in income from her veteran\u2019s disability rating and using it to resolve her financial \nissues. She has provided sufficient evidence to show that she acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant provided substantial evidence that as soon as \nshe had additional income she initiated and has adhered to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that her finances no longer \ngenerate questions about her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about her finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant  \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-i: \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant did not object. I have taken administrative notice of facts \ncontained in HE II, which are summarized below. \nPakistan \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. It has been engaged in a decades-\nlong armed conflict with militant groups that target government institutions and civilians. \nPakistan\u2019s military has carried out three coups since Pakistan\u2019s independence in 1947, \nand as of 2022, remained a dominant force in the country\u2019s political arena. Its chief \nexternal focus was on the perceived threat from India and the implications of the fall of \nthe government in Kabul, but over the past 15 years, the Pakistani military has also \nincreased its role in internal security missions, including counterinsurgency and \ncounterterrorism. The Pakistani military establishment also has a large stake in the \ncountry\u2019s economic sector; through two large conglomerates, it is involved in a diverse \narray of commercial activities, including banking, construction of public projects, \nemployment services, energy and power generation, fertilizer, food, housing, real \nestate, and security services. \nThe separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan, with \nwest and east sections, and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and \nIndia and Pakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict, in 1947 to 1948, 1965, and \n1999, respectively, over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these \ncountries in 1971, in which India assisted an indigenous movement reacting to the \nmarginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics, resulted in east Pakistan becoming the \nseparate nation of Bangladesh. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is \u201cLevel 3: Reconsider \nTravel,\u201d due to terrorism and sectarian violence. U.S. citizens are advised not to travel \nto several areas of the country in the Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, \nincluding the former federally administered tribal areas, due to terrorism and kidnapping. \nU.S. citizens are further advised not to travel to the immediate vicinity of the India-\nPakistan border due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict. Though Pakistan\u2019s \nsecurity environment has improved since 2014, the presence of foreign and indigenous \nterrorist groups poses a danger to U.S. travelers to Pakistan. Terrorists have targeted \nU.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKidnapping remains a concern throughout Pakistan. Extremist groups and \ncriminals have targeted business owners and prominent families to finance terror \noperations and profit through ransom. U.S. and foreign nationals working for non-\ngovernment organizations have been targets, and U.S. nationals have been kidnapped \nin other countries and held in Pakistan. The U.S. Government has limited ability to \nprovide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security \nenvironment. \nPakistan experienced significant terrorist threats in 2020, with the number of \nattacks and casualties slightly higher than in 2019. Major terrorist groups that focused \non conducting attacks in Pakistan included Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ISIS-\nPakistan. In 2020, Pakistan made limited progress on the most difficult aspects of its \n2015 national action plan to counter terrorism, specifically in its pledge to dismantle all \nterrorist organizations without delay or discrimination. Separatist militant groups \nconducted terrorist attacks against varied targets in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Islamabad as being a medium-threat \nlocation, and Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar and being high-threat locations, \nrespectively, for crime directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. \nSignificant human rights issues in Pakistan included credible reports of: unlawful \nor arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearance, torture and \ncases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or its \nagents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary detention; political \nprisoners; politically motivated reprisal against individuals in another country, including \nkillings, kidnappings, or violence; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; support \nto the Taliban, a non-state armed militant group that recruited and used child soldiers; \nserious restrictions on free expression and media, including violence against journalists, \nunjustified arrests and disappearances of journalists, censorship, and criminal \ndefamation laws; serious restrictions on internet freedom including site blocking; \nsubstantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of \nassociation, including overly restrictive laws for the operation of nongovernmental \norganizations and civil society organizations; severe restrictions of religious freedom; \nrestrictions on freedom of movement; serious government corruption; lack of \ninvestigation of and accountability for gender-based violence; trafficking in persons; \ncrimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting members of racial and ethnic \nminorities; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons; the existence or use of laws \ncriminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults; restrictions on \nworkers\u2019 freedom of association; and use of the worst forms of child labor. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer.

He was subsequently unemployed until July 2019, \nwhen he worked for a private company as a principal engineer until approximately 2021. \nHe also received an offer of employment from a DOD contractor in July 2019, \ncontingent on obtaining a security clearance.

(Tr. at 7-8, 25-26, 29, 90-93; GE 1-2; AE I) \nBefore becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016, Applicant was issued \nPakistani passports in 2003 and 2009, which expired in 2008 and 2014, respectively. \nHe was also issued a temporary Pakistani passport in approximately 2008, which \nexpired in 2009. He used his 2003 Pakistani passport to travel to Pakistan in 2005, to \nattend his siblings\u2019 weddings. While in Pakistan, he and his first spouse divorced. He did \nnot use his 2008 or 2009 Pakistani passports to travel. He was issued a U.S. passport \nin 2016, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2026. He used his U.S. passport to travel \nto Pakistan in 2021. He renounced his Pakistani citizenship in 2022, as further \ndiscussed below. (Tr. at 28-29, 58, 119, 125-126; GE 1-2; AE A, B) \nIn 1991, Applicant joined the Pakistani military to pursue a college education. \nThe Pakistani military covered the cost of his undergraduate tuition, provided him with a \nliving stipend, and paid him a salary. In return, he was required to fulfill a six-year \ncommitment upon graduation. After obtaining his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1994, he \ncompleted military training and was commissioned as a captain in 1995. He also \nunsuccessfully attempted, beginning in 1994 and then every two to three years, to \nresign from the Pakistani military. In 2003, the Pakistani government awarded him a \nscholarship to pursue his master\u2019s and doctorate degrees in the United States. In return, \nhe was required to work in Pakistan for two years. When he moved to the United States \nto pursue higher education, the Pakistani military placed him on \u201cfive-year study leave\u201d \nand continued to pay him a salary.

He chose to remain in the United States to complete his doctorate degree, \nand the Pakistani military consequently marked him as overstaying his leave. It ceased \ncommunication with him and terminated his military pay. He sent resignation letters to \nthe Pakistani military in 2008, 2010, and 2012, but received no response. In 2021, he \nreturned to Pakistan and paid the Pakistani government $12,000 USD for the military \nsalary he received while studying in the United States between 2003 and 2008. The \nPakistani military consequently accepted his resignation. He also renounced his \nPakistani citizenship and received a certificate of renunciation from the Pakistani \ngovernment in 2022.

(Answer; Tr. at 26-27, 32; GE 1-2) \nApplicant opened a bank account in Pakistan in 1999, through which he received \nhis pay from the Pakistani military. After the Pakistani military ceased paying him in \n2008, this bank account carried a zero balance, and he closed the account in 2009. He \nand his spouse do not own, and do not have any expectation of inheriting, any property \nor assets in Pakistan. As previously discussed, Applicant has owned his current home \nin the United States since 2020. His combined assets in the United States total just \nunder $1 million USD. He stated, \u201cThe USA is my home, the home of my [child] and my \nwife, and this is where I will be buried. If I must continue fighting to prove that I have \nonly one home, the USA, I will continue fighting.\u201d (Tr. at 30, 32-33, 48, 94-100, 127-131; \nGE 1-2) \nIn 2018, Applicant co-founded a non-profit organization in the United States. The \norganization is dedicated to promoting higher education among talented and needy \nstudents, to include individuals who graduated from the same college in Pakistan as he \ndid and who are pursuing higher education in the United States. He has since \nvoluntarily served as one of its directors. He received the President\u2019s Gold Volunteer \nService award in recognition of more than 500 hours of volunteer service to the United \nStates in 2022. (Tr. at 26, 29, 91-92, 100-109, 127; GE 1; AE A, F, G, H) \nThe individual who hired and has served as Applicant\u2019s manager since July 2019 \ndescribed Applicant as an \u201casset to any engineering organization,\u201d vouching for \nApplicant\u2019s valuable technical capability. Applicant\u2019s former director, to whom Applicant \nreported from 2010 to 2012, also attested to Applicant\u2019s valued technical expertise. A \nprofessor, for whom Applicant served as a graduate teaching assistant and graduate \nresearch assistant between 2003 and 2010, described Applicant as trustworthy. She \nnoted that he received a graduate award in 2009, and he was recognized as a \nmechanical engineering excellence teaching fellow in 2010. Applicant has authored and \nco-authored numerous publications since 2010. He also filed several patents from 2013 \nto 2015 and was issued one such patent in 2015. (Tr. at 29; AE I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \nthe applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden \nof persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s nephew, a citizen of Pakistan, has resided in the United States since \n2015. He obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States and has since worked for \na private company in the United States. In addition, Applicant has not had contact with \nthe Pakistani embassy representative or the other Pakistani government representative \nsince 2019. I find that none of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 are applicable \nto Applicant\u2019s nephew, the Pakistani embassy representative, or the other Pakistani \ngovernment representative, and I therefore find SOR \u00b6 1.c in part, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and \n1.i, in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant served in the Pakistani military from 1995 to at least 2003, during \nwhich time the Pakistani military paid for his college education in Pakistan. He also \nmaintained contact with three individuals with whom he served in the Pakistani military. \nApplicant\u2019s child is a resident of Pakistan, and Applicant\u2019s father, two sisters, two \nbrothers, mother-in-law, three brothers-in-law, and two sisters-in-law are Pakistani \ncitizens residing in Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s father served in the Pakistani military from \n1966 until his retirement in 1992. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s one brother-\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin-law worked for the Pakistani police and Applicant expected that he would be \nimminently retiring. Applicant\u2019s other brother-in-law served in the Pakistani military until \nhis retirement several years ago. Applicant has paid $100 USD monthly in child \nsupport, through his father, to his former spouse for his child in Pakistan since \napproximately 2005, and he intends to continue to do so until this child marries. \nApplicant and his spouse maintain regular contact with their family in Pakistan, and he \neven saw some of them when he traveled to Pakistan in 2021. \nThough Pakistan\u2019s security environment has improved since 2014, the presence \nof foreign and indigenous terrorist groups poses a danger to U.S. travelers through \nPakistan, and terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the \npast. Kidnapping remains a concern throughout Pakistan, as extremist groups and \ncriminals have targeted business owners and prominent families to finance terror \noperations and profit through ransom. U.S. and foreign nationals working for non-\ngovernment organizations have been targets, and U.S. nationals have been kidnapped \nin other countries and held in Pakistan. Significant human rights issues remain in \nPakistan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) are established. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in  \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s child is a Pakistani resident, and Applicant\u2019s father, siblings, and in-\nlaws are Pakistani citizens residing in Pakistan. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and \n7(e). Applicant and his spouse maintain close contact with their family in Pakistan. AG \n\u00b6 8(c) is not established. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2003. After earning his master\u2019s and \ndoctorate degrees in the United States, he has since worked in the United States. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore he moved to the United States to pursue higher education, he unsuccessfully \nattempted to resign from the Pakistani military in 1994 and every two to three years \nthereafter. After the Pakistani military informed him in 2008 that he needed to return to \nPakistan, he chose to remain in the United States. He sent resignation letters to the \nPakistani military in 2008, 2010, and 2012. In 2021, he paid the Pakistani government \nthe military salary he received while studying in the United States between 2003 and \n2008, and he renounced his Pakistani citizenship. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s \nties to Pakistan against his ties to the United States. The concerns over Applicant\u2019s ties \nto Pakistan, through his family there, do not create doubt about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant has met his burden of demonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations of the SOR. He noted that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f refer to the same real properties, 65 to 70% of the property is inherited and the remainder are rental investments he made from his savings in the United States (U.S.) and India. In his December 2022 answer, he estimated the total value of the property was $1,150,000. Regarding SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant admitted that he and his wife completed financial transactions of about $107,672 in 2020 to pay building contractors and material suppliers to construct an apartment building. He conducted about $160,000 in financial transactions in November 2017 and 2018 to purchase an Indian industrial shed. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, Applicant and his wife maintained a similar value in bank bonds to earn interest income. He transferred the bond value of $55,000 to the U.S. in 2021. As Applicant explained, the purpose of the Indian bank accounts is to manage his and his wife\u2019s income from India and to handle their property and financial transactions. (December 2022 answer to SOR at 1) No additional information was provided. Applicant, 49 years old, was born in India in 1974.

Though India has a friendly relationship with the U.S., there is ongoing \nevidence that the country illegally pursues American technology. The country is among \nthe most active in US trademark counterfeiting and copyright privacy infringement. \nActive anti-western terrorist groups, including Islamist extremist groups target public \nplaces frequented by Americans and other westerners. As of October 2022, the \nDepartment of State issued a Level 2 travel advisory for American citizens to be \nattentive to crime and terrorism in specific areas of India. The Indian states of Jammu \nand Kashmir continue to grapple with terrorist and insurgent incidents. \nIndian security forces continue to violate human rights with extrajudicial killings, \ntorture, rape, and pervasive corruption at all government levels. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections are only disqualifying if they \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security duties and his desire \nto assist his foreign family member. As the guideline indicates, the country in question \nmust be considered.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, brother, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens \nand residents of India. He gifted his mother $20,000 in 2018 to pay for her post-surgery \nexpenses. He provided a total of $9,000 in 2020 and 2021 to his mother-in-law for her \nmedical bills. He and his wife co-own real property in India, including rental apartments, \na rental industrial shed, residential and agricultural land valued in at approximately \n$1,150,000. He has executed financial transactions from multiple Indian bank accounts \nat Bank #1 and Bank #2 in calendar years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2017, 2018, and \n2020, which are cited in Findings of Fact. He uses the Indian bank accounts to deposit \nhis Indian income and manage his Indian property and financial transactions. While \nIndia is referred to as the world\u2019s largest democracy, the country continues to have \nhuman rights issues, as well as terrorist attacks at tourist locations, transportation \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npoints, and government facilities. This creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \ncoercion and a potential conflict of interest within the purview of \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f). \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nThough India has a friendly bilateral relationship with the U.S., there is ongoing \nevidence that the country illegally pursues American technology, which engenders \nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s ties to his Indian mother, brother, sister, mother-in-\nlaw and father-in-law. AG \u00b6 8(a) has limited application. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply \nbecause his foreign contacts with his foreign family members are not casual and \ninfrequent.  \nAG \u00b6 8(b) provides more mitigation than AG \u00b6 8(a) because of Applicant\u2019s \nresidence in the U.S. since July 1996. He received his master\u2019s degree from a U.S. \nuniversity in 1998, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2009. Based on \nhis ties to the U.S., there is an indication, though limited, to believe that he can be \nexpected to resolve a conflict of interest in favor of  U.S. interests. \nOn the other hand, Applicant and his wife have financial assets in India of \ngreater value than their assets on the U.S. He spent at least part of the period between \n2010 and late 2014, funding his day-to-day expenses through his Indian rental \nproperties. The record infers that he is still collecting rent from the Indian rentals at the \npresent time. In sum, the value of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s Indian financial interests \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nraise a significant potential for a conflict of interest that increases his exposure to \nforeign influence or pressure. AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines evaluated in the context of the whole-\nperson concept. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He was awarded a master\u2019s degree in 1998. He has \nbeen married to his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, since 2000. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. There is evidence that he has worked for his current \nemployer since 2015, and evidence that he has worked for his current employer before \n2010. This evidence weighs favorably in his application for a security clearance. \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s current ties to India are more substantial. He \nhas strong ties to his foreign family members both emotionally and financially. He and \nhis wife control a significant amount of land and other investment property that exceeds \nthe value of his American assets. They have multiple foreign bank accounts. \nConsidering the evidence from an overall commonsense point of view, Applicant has \nnot met his heavy burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by the foreign \ninfluence guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B): \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n   Subparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:  \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

The DCSA CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 7, 2022. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 24, 2023. On May 30, 2023, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing would be conducted \nvia video conference on July 20, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted without objection. Applicant and one other \nwitness testified. After the hearing, he timely submitted by August 21, 2023, three exhibits \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. AE A through AE C were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old  He married in June 1992 and divorced in February 2018. \nHe has one adult daughter (28) from his marriage. He and his cohabitant have a 13-year-\nold daughter. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1990 until \nDecember 2014, when he retired with an honorable discharge. He took courses from an \naviation institute from January 2015 until June 2016. At the time of his June 2021 SCA, \nhe was enrolled in a college. He was unemployed from January 2015 to October 2015, \nafter leaving the Navy. During that time, he was supported by his savings and did not \nsuffer any financial difficulties. Since December 2016, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor. He had security clearances while in the Navy. While serving in June 2010, his \nsecurity clearance was favorably adjudicated but with a caution to address his delinquent \ndebts. (GE 1, 2, and 7; Tr. 23-24.)  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts, 12 of which total \n$29,444. The SOR did not assign a value to the thirteenth, a foreclosed mortgage \naccount. (SOR.) The SOR is supported by the credit reports. (GE 4 through 6.)  Applicant \nadmitted those allegations with brief explanations. More specially, he admitted nine SOR \ndebts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, d \u2013 g, and i through k, stating: \u201cWorking with [XYZ] Law firm and \n[the creditor] to rectify the situation.\u201d Those nine debts total $24,531. (Answer.) His \nAnswer stated that he \u201cinherited this [SOR] debt after divorce.\u201d That was clarified during \nhis October 25, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI), when he said: \u201cDuring the divorce, \nit was ruled that [he] was financially responsible for all debts.\u201d Because he had given his \nthen wife a power of attorney for when he was deployed in the Navy, he was unaware of \nmost of the delinquent SOR debts. He found out about his debts, when he applied for a \nloan and was told that his credit score was very low. He then pulled his credit report and \nlooked into his debts. (GE 2; Tr.16-17.) \nIn about mid-June 2010 while on active duty in the Navy, Applicant had his security \nclearance favorably adjudicated. That favorable determination, however, came with a \nwarning that he needed to keep his finances in line. (Tr. 24-25.) \nApplicant received the SOR in about June or July 2022, and when he answered \nit, he was working with XYZ Law firm to address the SOR debts. He testified that he paid \nthe firm about $187 per month for about four months. AE A shows four payments to that \nfirm of $109.95 from April 2022 through July 2022. He wanted the firm to help him pay \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \nthe creditors. He learned, however, that the firm\u2019s purpose was not to pay his debts. The \nfirm was \u201cnot in the business of, actually, paying the debt\u201d but instead \u201cto . . . find ways \nto, or loopholes to, circumvent to improve\u201d his credit report. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d \nHe stopped using XYZ after July 2022. It did not resolve any of the SOR debts. (Tr. 25-\n29.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through f, and i through k. \nApplicant stopped working with XYZ Law firm in the summer of 2022 and  \ncontacted by phone each of the SOR creditors. He explained that if he lost his clearance, \nit would be financially detrimental to him. If that happened, he would be released by his \nemployer. He could not guarantee those creditors anything. He made the same phone \ncalls the week of the hearing after speaking with Department Counsel. Only one creditor, \ndiscussed below, made him a settlement offer. All others wanted lump sum payments, \n(Tr. 23, 31-37.) He had made similar calls in 2021 before his November 2, 2021 follow-\nup PSI, but none of those creditors \u201cwould work a payment plan with\u201d him.  He plans to \npay off each account when he has the money to pay the account in full. (GE 2.) Those \naccounts are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1,a through f, and i through k. Those SOR debts have not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. \nThis is a charged-off account for $1,458. Days before the hearing, after speaking \nwith Department Counsel, Applicant telephoned the collection agency and arranged a \npayment plan. He is to pay a fixed sum monthly beginning August 1, 2023, for 12 months. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted AE B, a schedule of 12 postdated, pre-authorized, \nand automatically withdrawn payments of $121.52 from his bank to the creditor. That will \nsatisfy the full balance. (Tr. 32-33.) This SOR debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.  \nThis is a charged-off account for $1,218. Applicant had agreed with the creditor to \na payment plan, but it has not yet sent him a written plan, as promised. (Tr. 34.) \nThis SOR debt has not been resolved \nSOR \u00b6 1.l.  \nThis is a medical account in collection for $62. Applicant testified that this account \nhad been resolved, and he was to provide supporting documents after the hearing. \n(Tr.36.) No documents were provided after the hearing. This SOR debt has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m.  \nThis is property associated with Applicant\u2019s home mortgage account that was \nforeclosed in 2019.

That is consistent with \nhis testimony that the home sold for more than was owed under the loan. (Tr. 37-39.) \nThis SOR account has been resolved. \nFinances \nApplicant testified about the current state of his finances per month. Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly income (take-home pay $5,398 and VA 90% disability) is about $8,700. His \nmonthly basic expenses are about $4,775, leaving a net remainder of about $3,925. (Tr. \n41-43): \nApplicant has zero in his savings account and $25 in his checking account. He \nrecently had to replace his air conditioner, which cost $9,300. He did not have that amount \nin his savings account, so a friend lent him $1,700, to be paid back tomorrow. He gives \nhis net remainder to his cohabitant. \u201cShe is the mother of my child, she takes care of the \nhouse. She pays all the bills.\u201d (Tr. 44-45.) The smaller SOR debts range from $2,390 to \n$62. \nApplicant testified about the lump sum back payment of $14,034 he received from \nthe Veterans Affairs Administration when his disability was raised to 90%. He received \nthat in December 2021 and used it \u201cto resolve a lot of debts.\u201d His credit score went from \n420 to 572, which he said was \u2018still not that great.\u201d He did not resolve the SOR debts. He \nresolved \u201cimmediate debts, like payday cash loans.\u201d (Tr. 46-47.) \nCharacter Witness \nApplicant called Ms. ABC as a character witness. She has known him for a little \nover 23 years. They have worked together for the same defense contractor for the past \nseven years, since 2016. She understands his background in security clearances within \nthe military and within their current employer. She has been his boss at their current \nemployer. She understands what he has told her about his financial situation. While was \nhe still in the service, his wife \u201cdecided to take out a couple of accounts . . . in his name \nand not mention anything.\u201d The witness knows that Applicant went to court a couple of \ntimes to get \u201c[his wife] to own up and pay for some of the stuff she was obligated to.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is getting better. The witness believes his credit score has \nimproved 12 points, then 20 points. He has been \u201cmaking strides.\u201d She does not think his \nfinancial situation was caused by his negligence or on purpose. (Tr. 15-19.) \nThe witness was in the U.S. Navy for eight years She did three cruises and was \nhonorably discharged for medical reasons. Applicant was one of her superiors in the \nNavy. He was her mentor, \u201ca guide to the Navy\u201d \u201cThe Navy decided they were going to \ncome up with this . . . Diversity Program . . .

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s financial woes \nculminated with his divorce that was concluded in 2018. That is not that long ago. His \nindebtedness, however, is recurring; it persists to this day. His debts are not mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two requirements. \nFirst, the conditions causing financial problems must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an \napplicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the \nadverse circumstances he confronted. \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness was incurred by his then wife, while he was in the Navy \non deployment. Using his power of attorney, she opened accounts that he was unaware \nof. He did not learn of those then delinquent accounts until he applied for a loan and was \ntold how low his credit score was. In the divorce case, he sought to have his wife held \naccountable for those debts. The court, however, ruled that he was responsible for all the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \ndebts. The conditions that caused his indebtedness were \u201clargely\u201d \u2013 if not wholly \u2013 beyond \nhis control. I find no nexus between his June 2010 favorable clearance determination with \na caution about his debts and the financial circumstances that caused his current \nproblems. The first requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied. \nThe second requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b) is that Applicant \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under \nhis circumstances. Here, in late 2021 before the SOR was issued, he contacted nine \ncreditors to ask for settlement terms to resolve his debts. Those creditors refused, instead \ndemanding lump sum payments. Those creditors are noted in the June 8, 2022 SOR. He \nreceived the SOR sometime in June or July 2022. By the time of his undated Answer \n(likely sometime in July 2022), he had retained XYZ Law firm to work with him and his \ncreditors to resolve nine of the SOR debts. From April 2022 through July 2022 he paid \nXYZ Law firm $109.95 per month for its services. By the time he had made those \npayments, the firm had not resolved any SOR debts. Applicant was dissatisfied and \ndiscontinued XYZ\u2019s services. \nNevertheless, during the week of the hearing, Applicant again contacted the SOR \ncreditors asking for settlement terms, other than lump sum payments. Only one was \nwilling to allow him to make installment payments. After the hearing, he timely submitted \nAE B, which documented 12 postdated, pre-authorized, and automatically withdrawn \nmonthly payments of $121.52 to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.g. In sum, he made efforts to resolve \nhis debts after his PSI and before the SOR was issued. And he continued up to the \nhearing day. Given the uncooperative position of his creditors, he plans to pay off each \naccount when he has the money to pay the account in full. Under the circumstances, that \nseems like a reasonable plan. I find that he has acted responsibly in confronting his \nfinancial situation, and his debts are mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(b). AG \u00b6 20(d) applies for \nsimilar reasons. \nThe Appeal Board has held that it is not necessary to pay off all the debts alleged \nin the SOR, nor is it required that they be paid off in any particular way. What is required \nis only that an Applicant have a reasonable plan to pay off his debts,and has taken some \nsteps towards execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 3, 2011). I find that the record evidence supports this conclusion here. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have specifically considered the favorable testimony of Ms. ABC about \nApplicant\u2019s character. She has known him for over 23 years, beginning when they served \ntogether in the Navy and now as co-workers. In the Navy, she was in a subordinate \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n. . \nposition to him. Thanks, however, to a diversity program, they were paired as a team and \nfound they had much in common. A friendship flourished that continues to this day. They \nknow each other\u2019s families closely and have shared the ups and downs of life. As civilians, \nthey have worked for the same defense contractor since 2016. Now she is his supervisor. \nShe praised him for having the \u201cutmost honesty and integrity.\u201d \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant alludes to a period of \nunemployment, a condition beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly to address \nthe resulting debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has provided nothing other than his bare \naverments regarding his claimed disputes. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k. against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F; and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has significant past-due debts that he has yet \nto address. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ndenied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

On \nAugust 8, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DoD acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

He obtained a personal loan to be able to satisfy the judgment in \nthe amount of $17,000. (Tr. at 58, 59; GE 7 at 6.) He explained the six-year delay in \npaying the judgment stating, \u201cI had to find out exactly where it is, and it took some time \nfor [the Court] to call me back and tell me what I needed to know and send them a check. \nPlus, I didn't have the money to pay them at the time.\u201d (Tr. at 58.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: past-due account charged off in the amount of $3,851.

During the \nexamination under Guideline E allegations Applicant was evasive in stating he was \nunaware whether the foreclosure happened. (Tr. 33-35.) He testified his parents bought \nthe house in 1992 and that his parents let his family live there. He paid the mortgages on \nthe house. Both mortgages appear on his credit reports. (Tr. at 63-65; GE 5 at 2; GE 7 \nat 9.) He explained \u201cWe paid the mortgage, and then I took out a second mortgage on \nthat house when we got in a financial situation. We were current with the first one. The \nsecond one, I let it lapse.\u201d (Tr. at 63.) He could not recall when he let the mortgage lapse, \nwhich according to the credit reports was in March 2014.

He stated he and \nhis wife had been living beyond their means. (Tr. at 46; GE 4.) \nAfter receiving the SOR Applicant hired a law firm in September 2022 to represent \nhim concerning the negative credit items. (Answer Exhibit.) At the hearing he \nacknowledged the law firm had not resolved any SOR accounts. (Tr. at 48.) \nApplicant discussed taking out a personal loan to settle SOR \u00b6 1.f. The total \namount of the loan was $17,000. He used a portion of the remainder of the loan to pay \noff a $5,000 debt with his sister that he incurred getting his teeth fixed in 2015. The \nremaining $7,000 went to settling other personal debt. The interest rate on the loan is \n26.5 percent. (Tr. at 83.)  \nApplicant admitted: \n\u2026 all my life since I got married, we were constantly in, like I said, we \noverspend. We got a lot of credit cards. We overspend.

(GE 2 at 18.) Government Exhibit 7 shows no \ndelinquent accounts on his current credit report. \nGuideline E \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. The Guideline E allegations stem from his failure to disclose \nthat information as set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j regarding whether a judgment had \nbeen entered against him and his failure to disclose that information as set forth in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, whether he had any property repossessed or foreclosed, defaulted on \nany loan, or had an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed. In his Answer Applicant stated \u201cWhen I fill[ed] out the [SCA] I did make \na mistake in filling it out but after I submitted [it,] I realized I had made a mistake and when \nI spoke with the investigator I did admit to the mistake and went over my credit history.\u201d \n(Answer.) \nDuring his security clearance interview he told the investigator that he was doing \nfine financially. He told the investigator he was meeting all his financial obligations. He \nresponded, no to the investigator as whether he was more than 120 days delinquent on \nany debt and whether he was involved in any credit counseling. He also responded, no \nas to whether he had any judgments or foreclosures against him. After these responses, \nthe investigator confronted him with the numerous debts and judgments set forth in SOR \n\u00b6 1.

He testified he was going to \ngo back in and resubmit it, but by the time he decided to do that, the investigator called \nand said he wanted to talk to him about his security clearance. (Tr. at 32.) \nApplicant was evasive stating he was unaware that the 2017 foreclosure \nhappened. After being asked again if he knew his house had been foreclosed on, he \nstated he assumed it was a short sale. (Tr. at 32-37.) Applicant initially denied receiving \n$97,000 back after both mortgages were paid off from the foreclosure until confronted by \nDepartment Counsel. He said the $97,000 went to paying off all the other creditors he \nand his wife owed. (Tr. at 37.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she let her husband \u201cdecide all those things\u201d when it \ncame to the foreclosure and the past debts.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant admits his history of living beyond his \nmeans goes back as far as when he got married. His debts are numerous, recent, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwere not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant did experience periods of \nunemployment and his wife\u2019s barber shop business was negatively impacted by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. He does support his testimony that he paid certain debts after the \nsecurity clearance process had been initiated and has offered to resolve others. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d His \nintentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record \nof debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant has \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. While he has apparently resolved other unlisted debts through a personal \nloan and the proceeds from the foreclosure sale there is no evidence these actions were \npart of a plan he initiated. The law firm he hired after the SOR was issued has not resolved \nany SOR account. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.12-01664 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014). The \nDirective does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d Good faith \u201crequires a showing that a \nperson acted in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence honesty, and adherence to \nduty or obligation.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare recent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely \nto recur. Applicant went through bankruptcy in 2004 and his financial condition since 2014 \nhas been poor. He has had a significant amount of delinquent debt for several years, \ndebts which he only began seriously to address when the clearance application process \ncommenced. In addition, those debts that he has resolved were addressed through \ninvoluntary means such as wage garnishment and foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s circumstances \nraise serious concerns about his judgment and reliability, concerns which cannot be \nsuccessfully mitigated by the debts he mitigated after his security clearance interview. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a references whether he deliberately failed to disclose the judgments set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j. The record supports he specifically withheld this \ninformation. He said he mistakenly  failed to disclose these judgments in his Answer and \nin his testimony. The financial questions on the SCA are straight forward and easy to \nunderstand. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant knew about the judgments. I am not convinced Applicant honestly \nanswered the questions on his SCA about the judgments. He elected not to disclose his \njudgments. The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, \nand 1.j. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b references whether he deliberately failed to the accounts set forth in \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k. The record supports he specifically knew he had \ndefaulted on a loan, \u201chad these specific bills or debts turned over to a collection agency\u201d \nor \u201chad any of these accounts charged off or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.b.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n        \n \n \n                \n                        \n                    \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established for either allegation. Applicant made no \neffort to correct the omissions in his SCA until he was confronted with them during the \nApril 2020 security clearance interview. Falsification of a security clearance application \n\u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.) I am satisfied that Applicant knew he had delinquent debts and a \njudgment when he submitted his SCA, and he deliberately chose not to disclose them. \nHis false statements on his SCA cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant was evasive in his testimony and did not act on his debts until after the \nsecurity clearance application process had been initiated. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor \nof national security, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about \nfinancial considerations or his personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d: \n    Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g:  \n\n \n \n \n \n                     \n                   \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \n Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \n \n \n \n Against Applicant \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \n\u00b6\u00b6eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nmaintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that \narticulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant is able to receive full credit under AG 20(d) with regard to the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.p, debts that she settled for lesser amounts. With regard to the \nremaining SOR debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are partially applicable. However, full \ncredit under these mitigating conditions is not warranted given the fact that Applicant \nfailed to act responsibly and neglected to remain in contact with her creditors. Some \ncircumstances \nadversely \naffected \nher \nfinances, \nincluding \nher \nspouse\u2019s \nunderemployment and the assistance her homeless stepfather required. However, she \nonly began to make payments long after her accounts were delinquent. \nThe evidence does not support application of any of the other potential mitigating \nconditions. Applcant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and she has not established \nthat her debts are being resolved or are under control. Nor did she document that any of \nthe remaining debts are not her responsibility. \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant admitted that when she completed her SF-86, she failed to provide \ncomplete or accurate information regarding her financial situation. She added that she \nbecame confused when completing her SF-86. I also note that she made numerous \nother mistakes or failed to report required information when completing her SF-86. She \ndiscussed these shortcomings during her OPM PSIs. Applicant\u2019s confusion and lack of \nattention to detail cannot be construed as a willful and deliberate attempt to undermine \nthe investigative process. Although the information she provided regarding her financial \nsituation, and other issues, on her SF-86 proved to be incorrect, I attribute these lapses \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto carelessness and am satisfied that she did not deliberately and intentionally fail to \ndisclose her delinquent debts with the intent to deceive. \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under \nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to \npresent evidence to explain the omission. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nApplicant refuted the allegation of falsification of her SF-86. No disqualifying \ncondition under Guideline E was established in this record, so discussion of potentially \nmitigating conditions is not warranted. \nConclusion \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guidelines F and E, I have reviewed the record before me in the context \nof the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed \nfor the majority of her adult life, and she is presumed to be a mature, responsible \ncitizen. Nonetheless, without other information suggesting that her long-standing \nfinancial problems are being addressed, doubts remain about her suitability for access \nto classified information. As noted, personal conduct concerns were not established. \nProtection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications. \nAccordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, she did not \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding her circumstances, articulate her position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. She failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding her past efforts to address her outstanding delinquent debt. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to \nfully establish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Answer) The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2023. \nApplicant obtained an attorney, and after coordinating with all parties, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 18, 2023, setting the \nhearing for August 30, 2023. This hearing was continued for good cause at the request \nof Applicant\u2019s attorney. A second hearing notice was issued on September 8, 2023, \nsetting the hearing for September 27, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9; and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through U. Except for GE 8 \nand 9 (see discussion below), all of the proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. I held the record open for two weeks in the event either party wanted \nto supplement the record with additional documentation. After the hearing, Applicant \ntimely submitted seven documents labeled AE V through BB. AE V through BB were \nadmitted, notwithstanding an objection made by Department Counsel, discussed below. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 6, 2023, and the record closed on \nOctober 18, 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to GE 8 and 9, which were unauthenticated \nsummaries of Applicant\u2019s background interview with a government security investigator. \nThe investigator was not called as a Government witness, and I therefore excluded those \nreports from being considered as evidence. During the hearing, I advised counsel that \nApplicant could be questioned about information he provided during his background \ninterviews, and Applicant could also choose to adopt any information reported therein. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel noted a concern about the relevance of \nAE P, entitled \u201cHyperglycemia in diabetes.\u201d Applicant\u2019s counsel said he would address \nthis concern during his case. Department Counsel did object to the admissibility of the \npost-hearing documents of AE W, AA and BB, but asked that limited weight be given to \nthe articles about diabetic ketoacidosis. Applicant did not present medical records or \nexpert testimony to support his claim that he was, in fact, suffering from diabetic \nketoacidosis on the night he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in November 2021. \nI admitted AE W, AE AA, and AE BB into evidence; however, I made it clear that whatever \nweight I would assign these documents would be left to my judicial discretion. The email \nexchanges between the parties and the judge about the admissibility of these documents \nis admitted as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all allegations contained in the SOR except SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Answer) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant amended his Answer to change all of his denials to \nadmissions under Guidelines J, G and E. (Tr. 10) After a thorough and careful review of \nthe admissions, pleadings, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old.

(GE 1; Tr. 29-30; AE K) \nCriminal Conduct: \nIn order to keep the events in chronological order, I will reverse the order of the \nSOR allegations. \nApplicant was arrested in December 1990 and charged with disorderly conduct. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k) He testified that he was staying in a dormitory when a fight occurred. The \npolice report in evidence showed that the victim specifically identified Applicant as being \none of the main assailants. The victim had seen Applicant holding a gun, thought to be a \nBB-gun, behind his back. The police found five rounds of .38spl, two WCC round nose \nlead rounds with brass cases, two federal round nose lead rounds with nickel cases, and \none Winchester .38+P jacketed hollow point round, in Applicant\u2019s pants pocket. Applicant \nadmitted that the police did find his bullets, but he claimed that his bullets were on a \nkeychain that had been discovered in his dresser drawer. There was no mention in the \npolice report that these bullets were found on a keychain or recovered from his dresser. \nApplicant admitted he had missed the original court date, and a bench warrant had been \nissued for his arrest. He was found guilty of an ammunitions violation and disorderly \nconduct. He paid restitution and a fine. He denied he had a BB gun or a pellet pistol the \nnight of his arrest. (Tr. 77-82; GE 2, 6, 7) \nIn September 1992, Applicant was charged with open container in a vehicle. An \narrest warrant was outstanding for Applicant\u2019s contempt of court charge, as noted above, \nand he was taken into custody. This offense was not alleged in the SOR. (GE 2, 6) \nApplicant was arrested in November 1991 and charged with aggravated assault. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j) He testified that his younger sister had been beat up by a group of girls and \nreturned home. The parents of the girls came to his house to confront his sister. One of \nthe parents pushed his sister, so he got in the middle and he may have pushed the parent \noff of his younger sister. He believed a neighbor had called the police and he and one of \nthe parents were arrested. At court they both decided that they did not want to press \ncharges and the case was dismissed. (Tr. 74-77; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that on September 14, 1992 Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith disorderly conduct. Applicant testified that he was in a group of eight friends, and \nthey had just finished watching a movie. They were in a strip mall playing around, acting \nimmature, and pushing each other when the police arrived and arrested them for \ndisorderly conduct. He was 23 years old at the time. They all appeared before the judge \nand were found not guilty. (Tr. 71-73; GE 2) \nIn about September 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly \nconduct. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) Applicant testified that some of his family members were in the \ncourtroom because the defendant had killed his father after driving under the influence of \nalcohol. Some of the defendant\u2019s family members were also in the courtroom, and \nApplicant had witnessed one member shove his mother.

He explained that his second oldest sister suffers from bipolar \ndisorder, and she threatened their mother. Applicant and his brother told her to leave the \nhouse. His sister called the police and reported false accusations about him and his \nbrother. They were both arrested despite neither one of them had touched their sister. \nThe charges against them were eventually nolle prosequi. (Tr. 66-70) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant was arrested in June 2007 for soliciting \nprostitution. He testified that an old female friend of his had asked him to meet with her \nbecause she had just learned that Applicant\u2019s mother had passed away in 2006. He did \nnot know that she was a prostitute. He met with her in his car in front of her grandmother\u2019s \nhouse. The police pulled up behind him, questioned them separately, and then informed \nApplicant that he was being arrested for soliciting prostitution. He claimed they had been \ntalking in the car for approximately 30 minutes. Applicant presumed his female friend must \nhave said something incriminating to the police for them to arrest him, or speculated that \nmaybe the police assumed he had been doing something illegal because they were aware \nthis female was a prostitute. Applicant stated the judge dismissed the charge against him. \n(Tr. 58-66) \nIn October 2010, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUIA). (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He testified: \nI fractured of a bone in my foot and I had a boot cast on. So I was going to \nCVS pharmacy to pick up a prescription. And as I was coming out of the \npharmacy, it was, a commotion was going on. I was in Chicago at the time. \nIt was commotion that was going on in that area. I don't know what \nhappened, but it was a commotion that was going on. Before I even got to \nthe car, the police had pulled, had stopped me before I got into the car. And \nas I didn't even get into car to drive it, they were saying that, you know, they \ncharged me with a DUI. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant stated that he believed he was arrested due to racial profiling, and that \nthe police officer did not even offer him a field sobriety test. Although there was no arrest \nrecord provided, a certified statement of disposition showed that Applicant was found not \nguilty of the DUIA. This alcohol-related arrest was not listed on his February 2022 SCA. \n(Tr. 54; AE E) \nIn June 2011, Applicant was arrested for driving on a revoked/suspended license. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). He testified that although he was found not guilty of DUIA in May 2011, he \nwas unaware that his driver\u2019s license had been suspended following this arrest. He also \nwas unaware that he needed to pay a fee to have his driver\u2019s license reinstated. He \nexplained this to the judge and was sentenced to perform community service.

Applicant testified \nthat in February 2020, he resided with his fianc\u00e9e (F), his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s son (FS), the son\u2019s \npartner (SP), and the son\u2019s children. At the time, SP was prohibited by Department of \nChildren and Family Services from supervising the children. While F and FS were away, \nApplicant became upset that SP was left to care for the children. FS returned home and \nhe and Applicant got into an argument. Eventually F arrived home, and she called the \npolice to report that Applicant had just pushed her. She made additional false allegations \nagainst Applicant to police. He was arrested and charged with domestic battery. On \nFebruary 25, 2020, F filed for a protective order against Applicant. While an interim \nprotective order was in effect, F claimed that Applicant circled her residence in his car; \nhowever, Applicant countered that he no longer had the make and model of car F had \nidentified. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE 1, 2, 5) \nApplicant submitted documentation that showed his newer car, a Honda CRV, was \npurchased on May 6, 2020. He possessed his original car for over two months after the \ninterim protection order had been issued. On February 9, 2021, this arrest was alerted \nthrough the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program because Applicant had failed to report \nit to his employer, as required. In April 2021, over a year since his arrest and due to delays \nfrom the pandemic, the judge found Applicant not guilty of the two charges. In September \n2021, his ex-fiancee filed another protective order against him for allegedly making phone \ncalls. She failed to appear in court and the protective order was vacated in October 2021. \nApplicant listed this arrest on his February 2022 SCA. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE 2, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in November 2021 and charged \nwith DUIA\u2013 2nd  offense,  improper traffic lane usage, and operating an uninsured motor\nvehicle. The police report disclosed that Applicant had reported that he was on his way\nhome from his sister\u2019s birthday party. Applicant at first d\n enied he consumed any alcohol,\nbut he later admitted to the police officer that he had consumed one alcoholic beverage.\nThe police report also disclosed that Applicant had participated in a breathalyzer test and\nappeared to have urinated in his pants. He was placed under arrest after his blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) was measured 0.245%. Applicant\u2019s car appeared to have been involved in\na hit and run accident since there was significant damage to the front of the car, the front\npassenger tire was blown, and Applicant had been driving on the rim.

He was in a state of confusion and was pulled over by the police for driving \nunder 20 mph in a 45 mph zone.

Applicant\u2019s counsel asked him if he was familiar with hyperglycemia. \nApplicant stated that this condition occurs when your blood sugar is not properly \ncontrolled with medication.

Applicant \ntestified that he had not consumed any alcohol that night or during the past 27 years after \nhis father was killed by a drunk driver in 1996. (Tr. 31-38; AE Q, R, S, U; GE 1, 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant testified that after the police dropped him off at his home he called 911 \nto go to the hospital. A blood sample was taken that showed his blood sugar was high, \nreportedly 126. He was held at the hospital for about four hours and released. He \neventually hired an attorney who recommended that he plead guilty to the reduced charge \nof reckless driving. In December 2022, Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving. He was \nrequired to enroll in an alcohol program, use an alcohol-testing device for one year, attend \na victims-impact panel, and pay fines of $2,502. His required use of the testing device \nwas later reduced to six months after he successfully passed all alcohol-breath tests. He \nwas also placed on probation for two years. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE 4) \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant remained on probation, which was scheduled \nto terminate on December 6, 2024. He disclosed this arrest on his February 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA). He listed that the DUIA charge was pending and that he \n\u201cwas on medication for tooth pain from the doctor.\u201d There is nothing in the police report \nthat indicated Applicant had told the police officer that he was not feeling well or that he \nneeded medical attention. He had been taken to the police station following his arrest, \nand he had refused to provide another breath sample or answer police questions. After \ncompleting the booking process the police dropped him off at his home. Applicant testified \nthat he was very confused, feeling terrible, and he was likely suffering from hyperglycemia \nat the time of his arrest. Since he had not consumed any alcohol, he assumed diabetic \nketoacidosis could have caused him to provide a false positive on the breathalyzer test, \nbased on the medical reports and studies in the record. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE \n1, 4) \nApplicant testified that he did not specifically request any alcohol test or toxicology \ntests when he was hospitalized following his arrest. The hospital records reflected that \nApplicant had apparently complained of abdominal pain following a motor vehicle \naccident. There was no evidence that Applicant entered the hospital due to high blood \nsugar, tooth pain, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The medical records disclosed \nthat Applicant had no evidence of acute abnormality in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis \nfollowing a CT scan. His lab results showed that he scored within the normal range, low \nrange, as well as in the high range in several test areas. There is no documentary \nevidence that Applicant experienced, tested, or was treated for high blood sugar levels, \nhyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. (Tr. 44; AE T, Y) \nThe medical information, studies, and reports in the record noted that \nhyperglycemia occurs usually when a person with diabetes skips insulin or other \nmedications prescribed to lower blood-sugar levels. It stated that \u201cHyperglycemia usually \ndoesn\u2019t cause symptoms until blood sugar (glucose) levels are high \u2013 above 180 to 200 \nmilligrams\u2026\u201d (emphasis added; AE P) The lab result of Applicant\u2019s blood sugar level \nfollowing his DUIA arrest was reported at 126.

(AE P) In this instance, Applicant had a tooth pulled on Thursday and on \nSunday morning at 4:30 a.m., he was arrested for DUIA and claimed he was likely \nsuffering from hyperglycemia. Based on this information it does not appear, nor is there \nany evidence to support, that Applicant was suffering from hyperglycemia at the time of \nhis second DUIA arrest. Applicant\u2019s systoms are consistent with a highly intoxicated \nindividual whose BAC was measured at 0.245%. (GE 4) \nAnother medical article described diabetic ketoacidosis as a severe medical \ncondition that is life-threatening. This condition develops after an individual suffers \nuncontrolled hyperglycemia. (AE AA) Because the record evidence did not establish \nApplicant suffered from hyperglycemia, Applicant similarly did not establish that he \nsuffered from diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, the discussion of this medical condition is \nirrelevant and not entitled to much weight in my decision. (AE P, W, AA, BB) \nApplicant was sentenced to enroll in the Level 2 intensive outpatient program \n(IOP). The one-page IOP summary from an addiction counselor stated that Applicant had \nsuccessfully completed the program on January 27, 2022: \n[Applicant] has been encouraged to regularly engage in community support \ngroup meetings (e.g. 12-step groups), get a sponsor; engage regularly in \nmental health treatment and continue to actively apply what had been \nlearned in group. (AE J, Z) \nThere was no diagnosis or prognosis given in the IOP summary, but based on the \ncomments provided, it appears that Applicant was treated for some type of substance \nmisuse. The addiction counselor\u2019s recommendation that Applicant participate in a \ncontinuing support group and obtain a sponsor infers that Applicant had misused some \ntype of substance. Applicant did not disclose this alcohol treatment, which he had just \ncompleted, on his February 2022 SCA. He did not provide complete treatment records \nexcept for the one-page summary. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant is \ncomplying with the addiction counselor\u2019s recommendations. (Tr. 44; AE J, Z; GE 1) \nApplicant has been employed by a federal contractor for six years. He stated that \nhe just recently found out that he is required to report any arrest to his employer. He \ninitially denied that the employer provided annual security briefings, but then he changed \nhis mind and admitted they do have annual security briefings. The reporting requirement, \nhowever, had not been discussed during those earlier security briefings. He did not report \nhis February 2020 arrest for domestic assault/physical contact, his August 2020 arrest for \nviolation of a protection order, or his November 2021 arrest for DUIA to his employer, as \nrequired.

(AE H, M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c). Applicant was \ninvolved in multiple arrests between 1990 and 2021, and he is currently on probation until \nDecember 2024. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct spans over three decades and raises \nserious security concerns. He remains on probation until December 2024 due to his \nNovember 2021 conviction. Insufficient time has passed to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct will not recur. Based on those facts, his criminal conduct continues to \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed \nto mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 22 provides a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant was involved in two \nalcohol-related arrests in 2010 and 2021, and his November 2021 BAC recording was \nextremely high at .245%. There is no evidence he followed treatment recommendations \nfrom his Level 2 IOP treatment he completed in january 2022. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \nApplicant denied that he has consumed any alcohol since his father was killed by \na drunk driver in 1996. When discussing his arrests, he denied responsibility or culpability \nfor almost every single arrest alleged in the SOR. When addressing his most recent \narrest, he claimed he needed immediate hospital treatment for his high blood sugar and/or \ntooth pain when he was arrested by police in November 2021. He initially denied drinking \nany alcohol but then he admitted to police he had consumed one alcoholic beverage. His \nblood alcohol content registered extremely high at .245%, well above the legal limit. There \nis no mention in the police report of any request for immediate medical treatment. \nApplicant reiterated that immediately following his arrest he went to the hospital to get his \nhigh blood sugar levels under control. The post-hearing submission of the hospital \nrecords does not support his testimony. The records clearly indicate that he received a \nCT scan on his chest, abdomen, and pelvis following a motor vehicle accident. There was \nnothing in the hospital record that indicated Applicant complained of symptoms consistent \nwith high blood sugar levels, hyperglymia, or diabetic ketoacidosis, provided test results \nestablishing these conditions, or has ever been treated for these conditions. Given the \npattern of discrepancies between the documentary evidence and Applicant\u2019s claims, I did \nnot find his testimony credible. \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s completion of alcohol treatment, the addiction \ncounselor\u2019s aftercare recommendations support the conclusion that Applicant met the \ncriteria for some type of substance abuse disorder necessitating further care. He was \nencouraged to regularly engage in community support group meetings (e.g. 12-step \ngroups), get a sponsor; engage reguarly in mental health treatment and continue to \nactively apply what had been learned in group. There is no evidence that Applicant \nadhered to the aftercare recommendations. Based on him being an unreliable witness, \nthere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above conditions. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a \nwhole-person \nassessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n11 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nperson may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule  violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nAll of the Guideline J allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k) are cross-alleged under the \ncurrent Guideline. Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, two alcohol-related arrests, and \nprobation until December 2024 support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) and16(e)(1). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant is not a credible witness. His failure to accept responsibility for his \nmisconduct and his misrepresentation of relevant facts indicate that he may be personally \nor professionally vulnerable if his criminal and alcohol-related misconduct were known to \nthe community. Overall, he has shown little remorse or rehabilitation following his pattern \nof rule violations, and his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J, G, and E into my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant was arrested on at least 11 occasions over three decades. He is \ncurrently on probation until December 2024. He has not been candid about the \ncircumstances of his criminal and alcohol-related offenses. I find that more time is \nrequired without repeat offenses before Applicant can be considered successfully \nrehabilitated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the criminal conduct, alcohol consumption and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through  1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. National security eligibility is denied. \nPamela Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

(Tr. 15-21; Response to SOR; GE 1; \nAE B; AE I) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a history of mental health issues which raise \na security concern, to include: \n1.a In September 2017, Applicant was admitted for mental health treatment at \n[Redacted for Privacy] Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center for five days inpatient \ntreatment. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate; \nsuicidal ideation; and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE \n2 at 8) \n1.b  Applicant received mental health treatment at the VA Medical Center from \nSeptember 2017 to April 2019 for treatment related to suicidal ideation and major \ndepressive disorder. The record evidence indicates this was outpatient treatment. (GE 2 \nat 5, 8; GE 6; GE 7) \n1.c In December 2017, Applicant was admitted to [Redacted for Privacy] Hospital \nfor three days for depression and suicidal ideation. He was diagnosed with major \ndepressive disorder, severe, recurrent, without psychotic features. He was discharged in \ngood condition. (GE 1 at 38; GE 2 at 8; GE 5) \n1.d Finally, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist on June 14, 2021. \nThe psychologist determined he had a history of persistent depression and emotional \ndysregulation, which seems to worsen in response to significant psychological stressors. \nThere was concern he was not engaged in psychotherapy nor receiving medication \nmanagement although he was open and eager to receive services. If Applicant was able \nto receive consistent therapeutic support, his prognosis would be favorable. His emotional \nfunctioning appeared to be contingent on the level of stability in his environment, as \ndisruptions in attachment have precipitated his emotional and behavioral dysregulation, \nleading to impulsive behaviors and safety concerns. At the time of the evaluation, he \npresented with stability in mood, with absence of clinically significant difficulties that would \ninterfere with his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. However, to ensure his stability \nover time, engagement in treatment is recommended. (GE 3; GE 4) \nApplicant and his wife married in 2008. His deployment in 2010 was not good for \nhis marriage. He and his wife had poor communication. Applicant was unfaithful to his \nwife. His wife discovered he was unfaithful in April 2017. She moved out of the house in \nDecember 2017. The divorce was final in October 2019. Applicant became depressed \nbecause of the break-up of his marriage and sought treatment in September 2017 \nbecause he was having suicidal ideations. He made two unsuccessful attempts to kill \nhimself and realized he needed help. He was inpatient for five days and was put on \nmedication. He claims he never received a formal diagnosis, but admits he was \ndepressed.

He attended weekly single \nand group therapy. On occasion, he would attend bi-weekly. He felt the therapy was very \nbeneficial to him. It helped him move on from a period in his life when he felt isolated and \ndepressed. It also helped him deal with his divorce. The medication helped him stabilize \nhis mood and thoughts. (Tr. 27-29) \nOn December 24, 2017, Applicant was admitted to the hospital for depression and \nsuicidal ideation. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder severe, recurrent, \nwithout psychotic features. Applicant testified he does not remember what happened on \nDecember 24th, other than it was a bad day. He woke up in the hospital. The episode was \ndescribed by medical personnel as transient global amnesia. The medical records \nindicate Applicant came to the hospital because he was depressed about his pending \ndivorce from his wife. At some point before going to the hospital, he texted his wife that \nhe was going to hang himself. He also believes he contacted his sister but does not recall \nwhat he told her. His sister called 911 and the police took him to the emergency room of \nanother hospital. He was transported to the treating hospital via ambulance. (GE 5 at 2, \n4; GE 6 at 43-49) He stayed in the hospital for three days. During his stay he spoke to a \ndoctor on two occasions and attended group therapy sessions. He was also prescribed \nmedication to stabilize him. He was discharged after three nights in good condition. Ms. \nR, his therapist at the VA, was told about this incident. His treatment remained the same. \n(Tr. 29-32; GE 5; GE 6 at 43-49) \nApplicant\u2019s therapy sessions at the VA taught him strategies on how to cope with \nhis depression and anxiety to include daily exercise and getting involved in outside \nactivities. He works out every day. Exercise keeps him motivated and stable. (Tr. 32-33; \nAE G; AE T). He is a member of an adult baseball team. (AE R) He also started attending \nchurch services again and participates in young adult gatherings to include barbeques. \nHe credits his brother and sister with providing support. (Tr. 33-35, 39; AE F; AE S) In \n2017, he did not have a good support network, he has worked on becoming more involved \nand now has a good support network. He also has a new girlfriend whom he has known \nsince 2019 but started dating in 2023. (Tr. 37, 46; AE Q) \nDuring his first hospitalization in September 2017, Applicant lost his right to own \nfirearms. In September 2017, Applicant petitioned the court for Restoration of Right to \nOwn, Possess, Control, Receive or Purchase Firearms. Before the hearing date, he met \nwith Dr G., a licensed psychologist, at least twice. Dr. G. assessed Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth to determine whether he was capable of safely possessing and using firearms. \nShe prepared a report which was submitted to the court. The court found by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Applicant was able to use firearms in a safe and \nlawful manner and that there was no current danger to himself or others. The court \ngranted Applicant\u2019s petition on June 5, 2018.

(GE 2) \nPsychological Evaluations and Therapy \nAt the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. M.L., a licensed \nclinical psychologist, on June 14, 2021. The evaluation was conducted on-line since \nApplicant is currently located overseas. The psychologist noted Applicant said he was in \ngood health and was not taking any form of medication at the time of the interview. He \nwas also not actively engaged in mental health services, though he reported interest in \npursuing psychotherapy supports. He stopped going to therapy in July 2018 when he \nrelocated to a new city and had difficulty accessing services. He was previously \nprescribed sertraline and fluoxetine for mood, and hydroxyzine as needed for sleep. He \nno longer takes medication. (GE 3; GE 4) \nApplicant reported a history of sexual addiction, which began in adolescence with \npornography. He spent approximately four hours per day online. From 2011 to 2013, he \nreceived treatment with a social worker. His sex addiction later escalated. He began \nhaving affairs during his marriage, which ultimately led to his divorce. He reported he has \nbeen \u201cclean and sober\u201d from his sexual addiction for at least three years. He credits his \nmeetings with Sex Addicts Anonymous as \u201ca big part of his recovery.\u201d He no longer \nattends meetings but has developed insight surrounding his patterns of addiction and \ntheir association with trauma and suppression. (GE 3) \nApplicant was described as \u201copen and engaged during the clinical interview.\u201d His \ncurrent judgment was assessed to be clear. His narratives during the clinical interview \nand documentation provided by the CAF were highly consistent. Dr. M. L. concluded the \ninformation provided during the assessment is thought to be a valid representation of his \ncurrent functioning. (GE 3 at 8) \nApplicant completed the Personal Assessment Inventory (PAI), a 344 item, self-\nadministered objective inventory of adult personality. Applicant\u2019s responses did not result \nin any clinically significant elevations across domains that would be suggestive of current \nclinical psychopathology. His results reflected mid-to-moderate areas of difficulty in \nregard to maladaptive behavior patterns aimed at controlling anxiety. It is consistent with \nwhat would be expected for an individual who experienced a disturbing traumatic event \nthat contributes to periods of distress and recurrent periods of anxiety. (GE 3 at 8) \nDr. M.L. concluded Applicant did not currently meet criteria for PTSD, though \ncomplex trauma is an important consideration in his diagnostic presentation. Dr. M.L. \nnoted some indications of borderline personality traits, but she would have to conduct \nadditional tests to make a conclusion. His prolonged emotional stability appears to be \ncontingent on the stability of his environment and relationships which warrants concern \naround his propensity for coping in response to stressors.

Dr. M.L was concerned that he was not engaged in psychotherapy or receiving \nany medication management, though he reported being quite open and eager to receive \nservices and has experienced barriers to accessing consistent care. With consistent \ntherapeutic supports in place to be able to manage his response to stressors in his \nenvironment, his prognosis is favorable. His emotional functioning appears to be \ncontingent on the level of stability in his environment, as disruptions in attachment have \nprecipitated his emotional and behavioral dysregulation, leading to impulsive behaviors \nand safety concerns. Applicant presents with stability in mood, with an absence of \nclinically significant difficulties that would interfere with his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness at this time. However, to ensure his stability over time, engagement in \ntreatment is strongly recommended. (GE 3 at 10) \nIn May 2023, Applicant started attending online counseling sessions with Mr. C., \nMaster of Science (MS), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). Applicant meets with \nMr. C. once a week, provided it does not interfere with his work schedule. He is working \nwith Mr. C. on three goals. First, understanding and distinguishing past relationship \ndynamics to develop healthier relationship patterns in the future. Second, discussing \nways to cope and manage current relationship challenges in his life. Third, identify \nstrategies to help through various life changes and transitions. (Tr. 39-42; AE U) \nMr. C. provided a statement indicating that Applicant continues to engage in \ntherapy. He has reviewed and discussed tools to reduce frequency and intensity of \nemotions, create daily self-care routines, ways to build/maintain healthy relationships, and \nidentifying specific needs during times of transitions such as relocation, relationship \ndevelopment, and job changes. He has counseled Applicant on strategies related to self-\ncare assessment, values: self-exploration, meaningful relationships, grounding \ntechniques, sleep hygiene, and setting boundaries (communication techniques). (AE U) \nApplicant was provided a self-care assessment, Generalized Anxiety Disorder \u2013 7 \n(GAD-7). He measured on the GAD-7 assessment as \u201cno to minimal\u201d anxiety range. \nIndividuals within this range demonstrate minimal to no daily anxiety symptoms that would \nimpact their daily or executive functioning. He was also given a Patient Health \nQuestionnaire-9 related to depression. He measured in the \u201cno to minimal\u201d depression \nrange. This range would indicate an individual has minimal difficulties with elevated \nmoods being directly related to situational and/or expected stressors (e.g strained \nrelationships, work, society/cultural conflict.) (AE U) \nMr. C. indicated Applicant has made moderate progress since starting therapy. He \nstates adjustment disorder with minor depressive traits would be most aligned with \nApplicant\u2019s reported symptoms. He recommends Applicant to continue to engage in \nweekly/bi-weekly therapy sessions, addressing ongoing reported strain with stress, \ndifficulties with social/relationship situations, and professional challenges which impact \nmood and relate to transitions.

(Tr. \n40-41)  \nOn August 28, 2023, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. J.B.C., a licensed \npsychologist. The evaluation was conducted on-line. She reviewed Applicant\u2019s \nbackground history which is consistent with the record evidence and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. She also reviewed the 2021 psychological evaluation of Dr. M.L., who was \nhired by the DOD to assess Applicant\u2019s mental health situation. Dr. J.B.C. states: \nAs of this evaluation in 2023, the client does not present with any clinically \nsignificant difficulties, maintains a stable mood, engages in numerous self-\ncare techniques to maintain proper diet, sleep hygiene, physical fitness and \nemotional and spiritual wellness. Additionally, he is in routine \npsychotherapy and is engaged in a new relationship. He has gained a great \ndeal of insight into his own behaviors and how those affect others as well \nas insight into what precipitates depressive symptoms. (AE V)  \nDuring the clinical interview, Dr. J.B.C. noted Applicant\u2019s judgment is adequate and \ninsight is good. He was cooperative and friendly and did not appear to be making efforts \nat deception. (AE U at 3) Applicant completed the PAI, a 344 item, self-administered \nobjective test of personality and psychopathology. His PAI clinical profile is entirely within \nnormal limits. According to his self-report, Applicant reported no significant problems in \nthe following areas: unusual thoughts or peculiar experiences; antisocial behavior; \nproblems with empathy; undue suspiciousness or hostility; extreme moodiness and \nimpulsivity; unhappiness and depression; unusually elevated mood or heightened activity; \nmarked anxiety; problematic behaviors used to manage anxiety; and difficulties with \nhealth or physical functioning. He also reported no significant problems with alcohol or \ndrug abuse or dependence. (AE V at 3) \nDr. J.B.C. notes there was an elevation on the anxiety-related disorder scale-\ntraumatic stress. She notes it is a one scale elevation and not an overall pattern. She \ndiscussed lingering traumatic stressors with Applicant, specifically some of the events \nthat occurred during his deployment to Iraq which trouble him at times. While not \nphysically injured, he was exposed to nearly daily rocket attacks. He had a close call \nwhen one landed just outside the entrance to the dining hall while he was finishing lunch. \n(AE V at 4) \nApplicant also completed the SPECTRA: Indices of Psychopathology, a brief 96-\nitem self-administered, multiscale measure of psychopathology and functioning. His \nscore was within normal limits. (AE V at 4) \nDr. J.B.C. concludes that based on available past medical and current data, \nApplicant qualifies for a diagnosis of major depressive order, recurrent, in full remission. \nShe opines Applicant does not present with any conditions at this time that could pose a \nsignificant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness.

(AE V at 4) \nApplicant has had no incidents since December 2017. He is still working on issues \nrelated to his divorce, but believes he is doing well. He believes treatment has helped a \nlot. (Tr. 41-42) \nMatters Not Alleged in the SOR \nDepartment Counsel questioned Applicant about several matters that were not \nalleged in the SOR. Because they are not alleged in the SOR, these matters are not \nconsidered as disqualifying conduct, though they may be considered to evaluate evidence \nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2016). I will consider these unalleged matters, \naccordingly. \nIn 2014, while on active duty, a new First Sergeant came to Applicant\u2019s unit. \nApplicant did not get along with him. The First Sergeant wrote him up for failure to obey \norders. Applicant had an agreement with the previous First Sergeant that he could leave \nwork early on Wednesdays to attend his bowling league. He continued to leave early on \nWednesdays. It is not clear whether he sought authorization from his new First Sergeant. \nHe was written up for leaving work early without prior authorization. (GE 1 at 17; GE 2 at \n7) \nIn April 2018, Applicant was written up at his civilian job for performing an action \nwithout a verifier present. The action required a person to take the action and another \nperson to verify the action. Applicant had just started a new medication and was \nexperiencing side effects including drowsiness.  He performed the action on his own. He \nadmits his actions could have caused damage. He received a warning for this violation. \nApplicant switched medications and became more careful with following policies and \nregulations. (Tr. 49; GE 1 at 15; GE 2 at 7) \nIn May 2018, Applicant and three co-workers were written up and suspended from \nwork for not clicking on the satellite prompt that said \u201cenable.\u201d He and his co-workers \nread the prompt as saying \u201cenabled.\u201d He was suspended for three days.

Applicant had the opportunity to appeal this action but opted to be transferred \nto the IRR. (GE 8) Applicant testified that he stopped attending drills when he moved to \nanother city and his work schedule conflicted with drill weekends. (Tr. 52-53) I conclude \nthis action does not have security significance. \nWhole-Person Evidence  \nSeveral friends and colleagues wrote letters of support for Applicant. Mr. J.C., \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, has worked with him since March 2021. He notes that \nApplicant has been recognized on two occasions for his outstanding performance. He \nachieved a satisfactory score for a COMSEC folder inspection. The inspecting unit \nmentioned that \u201cThe [Unit] team maintains an exemplary COMSEC program.\u201d He was a \nmember of a two-person team which successfully implemented a \u201cMilstar Network \nCutover event\u201d. His efforts ensured the network event transitioned on schedule with no \nimpact to the mission critical communications system. Mr. J.C. concludes by saying that \nApplicant exemplifies what it means to be dedicated to the mission and takes extreme \npride in his work. He has become a valuable asset to the team in a short amount of time. \n(AE A) \nDr. B. is executive director of a facility that works with males who are homeless, \nsuffer from mental health issues, in probation/parole, and/or struggle with drug addiction. \nHe has known Applicant for 30 years. They attended the same elementary school and \nhigh school. They know each other\u2019s families. At one point, they were married to two \nsisters until Applicant and his wife divorced. He is aware of many of the details of what \nApplicant went through during the divorce, but he and his spouse designated him to be \none of three individuals to manage their assets and care for their three daughters should \nsomething happen to them. They chose him because they wanted a person who would \ndo the right thing for their children. Applicant is honest, responsible and trustworthy. (AE \nA) \nThe pastor of Applicant\u2019s church has known Applicant since May 2021. He attends \nSunday services regularly. He participates in after service barbeques, and attends weekly \nBible study sessions on Wednesday evenings if his work schedule permits. He looks \nforward to his spiritual growth and further involvement in the congregation.

(AE \nB; AE J)  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d are supported by the medical records and \nApplicant\u2019s testimony.  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness: and \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s two suicide attempts and suicidal \nideations in 2017. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is established by the psychologist\u2019s report requested by DOD CAF, \nwhich is specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is established because of Applicants two voluntary inpatient \nhospitalizations in September 2017 and December 2017. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation:: \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) applies.  Applicant sought out and was responsive to treatment for his \nmajor depressive disorder and suicidal ideations in 2017. He took medication and \nattended mostly weekly, but sometimes bi-weekly counseling sessions with a therapist \nfrom the VA. He implemented the suggested coping mechanisms from his therapist. He \ntook medication to deal with his depression and anxiety until he felt he no longer needed \nthem. He now exercises regularly; is involved in his church; plays on an adult baseball \nteam and is more engaged with others.

While Applicant stopped taking medication and attending \ncounseling in April 2019, he still followed the recommended actions that would help him \ncope and deal with stress.  In May 2023, Applicant began seeing a therapist on a weekly \nbasis to deal with some residual feelings related to his divorce; to learn how to cope and \nmanage current relationship challenges in his life; and to identify strategies to help \nthrough various life changes and transitions related to his upcoming move to another job \nlocated back in the United States. Mr. C. indicates Applicant has made moderate \nprogress. In August 2023, Dr. J.B.C., a licensed psychologist, diagnosed his condition as \nmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is established. Dr. M.L., the licensed clinical psychologist hired by the \nDOD, concluded that Applicant\u2019s condition was under control, but she could not give him \na favorable prognosis without Applicant attending therapy to help manage stressors in his \nenvironment. Applicant is now actively attending therapy. \nAG \u00b6 29(d) applies.  While Applicant is aware he will always need to take steps to \nmanage his depression, the primary factor contributing to his instability in 2017 was the \nbreakup of his marriage and subsequent divorce. He has been divorced for over five \nyears and no longer has contact with his wife. Throughout this process, he has been \nhonest about his mental health and interested in getting better. He attended counseling \nfor a period of two years and took anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications until he \nno longer needed it. In 2021, he accepted a job overseas and has created a new life for \nhimself. He is stable and is active in his community. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) applies. Aside from the evidence presented by Applicant showing he \nhas taken steps to improve his outlook on life, he was recently evaluated by Dr. J.B.C, a \nlicensed psychologist, on August 28, 2023. After the evaluation, Dr. J.B.C. concluded that \nbased on past medical and current data, Applicant qualifies for a diagnosis of major \ndepressive order, recurrent, in full remission. He does not present any conditions at this \ntime that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Dr. \nJ.B.C. notes Applicant has gained a great deal of insight into what precipitates his \ndepressive episodes. He was actively attending psychotherapy and understood the \nimportance of therapy.  \nOver the past five years, Applicant has sought help for mental health issues. He \nfollowed the advice of his therapists on how to cope with future issues. He exercises on \na regular basis, attends church on a regular basis, plays on a baseball team, and recently \nentered into a new relationship. He has not encountered a major depressive episode or \nsuicidal ideation in over five years. There is no indication of a current problem. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service, to include his deployment to Iraq. I considered the favorable testimonials \nfrom his current supervisor and his childhood friend. He was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. He demonstrated during his testimony that he is aware of his problems with \ndepression and has taken steps to cope with his depression and the daily issues and \nchallenges of life. \nWhile not alleged in the SOR, I considered the past counselings Applicant received \nwhile on active duty and while working in a previous job under the whole-person. I do not \nbelieve these past incidents have security significance. Applicant disclosed these \ncounselings during his security clearance background investigation. He learned from \nthem and has not had any on-the-job counselings since 2018. \nSince his divorce, Applicant has moved on and has taken steps to be more \ninvolved with others and is highly thought of by his current supervisor. He has done the \nwork to develop coping skills when he encounters situations that cause him anxiety. He \nhas not had a serious depressive episode since 2017. I have no questions about his \nreliability and trustworthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns raised under Psychological Conditions. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions):  FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has taken online college courses but does not have a degree. She has never married and has no children. She has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 19 delinquent debts totaling about $14,741. All the debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in credit reports from June 2022 and October 2020 (FORM Items 5 and 6). Applicant admitted all the debts in her answer to the SOR, but provided no information explaining how they were incurred or what actions, if any, she had taken to resolve them. When Applicant submitted her SCA, she disclosed that she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 2016 and received a discharge in May 2016. Debts totaling about $10,000 were discharged. (FORM Item 3 at 33.) In the same SCA, she also disclosed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, attributed them to \u201cfinancial difficulties,\u201d and stated that she had asked to settle them through an online service.

Her \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has taken online \ncollege courses but does not have a degree. She has never married and has no \nchildren. She has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 19 delinquent debts \ntotaling about $14,741. All the debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in credit reports \nfrom June 2022 and October 2020 (FORM Items 5 and 6). Applicant admitted all the \ndebts in her answer to the SOR, but provided no information explaining how they were \nincurred or what actions, if any, she had taken to resolve them. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA, she disclosed that she filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition in February 2016 and received a discharge in May 2016. Debts \ntotaling about $10,000 were discharged. (FORM Item 3 at 33.) In the same SCA, she \nalso disclosed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, attributed them to \n\u201cfinancial difficulties,\u201d and stated that she had asked to settle them through an online \nservice. (FORM Item 1 at 35-37) \nIn her answer to DOHA interrogatories in March 2022, Applicant admitted the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.m, 1.p, and 1.r. For each debt, she admitted that the debt \nwas not paid, and no arrangements had been made to pay it. (FORM Item 4 at 2-6) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and numerous. She submitted no evidence showing that they were incurred \nunder unusual circumstances or circumstances largely beyond her control. She \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted no evidence of financial counseling, payments, or payment plans. She has \nnot disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent \ndebts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On June \n29, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of video \nteleconference hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for July 18, 2023. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. I received three Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 3) and nineteen \nApplicant exhibits (AE A \u2013 AE T) and considered Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on August 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man with four adult children. He and his wife have \nbeen married for 26 years. A previous marriage ended in divorce. Applicant has a high \nschool diploma and has taken some college courses. (AE G; Tr. 11) He is a veteran of both \nthe U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. Applicant served in the Navy from 1987 to 1991. (AE B) \nHe was discharged honorably. In 1998, Applicant enlisted in the Army and served until \n2015, when he retired honorably. (AE A) While in the Army, he completed three tours of \nduty in combat zones. (Tr. 22) He has held a security clearance since 1988. (Tr. 21) \nThrough Applicant\u2019s Army career, he developed subject-matter expertise in the field \nof ordnance, storage, and security. (AE F at 3) Since February 2021, he has been working \nfor his current employer as a security officer. (GE 1 at 12) \nApplicant has a history of misconduct of a sexual nature. In 1999, he was cited for \nsolicitation of a prostitute. (Answer at 1) Applicant testified that he had no intention of \nsoliciting a prostitute that evening. Rather, while he was sitting at a traffic light on the way \nhome one evening in a part of town where prostitutes congregated, he saw a woman get \nout of a sports car. (AE T at 4) He suspected the woman was an undercover police officer \nbecause she was well dressed and looked \u201cmuch different than the other typical ladies of \nthe night would [look] in that area.\u201d He explained further that, because he was taking a \ncourse in criminology at the time, he wanted to speak to the supposed undercover officer to \nsee firsthand how undercover sting operations are conducted, in the event he ever needed \nto write a paper on the subject. (Tr. 26; GE 2 at 14) Subsequently, he asked the woman \nwhere she took her johns, and she nodded her head in the direction of a nearby hotel. (GE \n2 at 15) Applicant then drove his car towards the hotel and parked at an adjacent parking \nlot, whereupon multiple police officers pulled beside him in unmarked vehicles and issued \nhim a citation for soliciting prostitution. (Tr. 28) Subsequently, Applicant paid a fine. \nShortly after the episode, Applicant told his wife the same explanation of the \ncircumstances surrounding the issuance of the citation, to which he testified. She did not \nfind this explanation credible. (Tr. 48) \nBeginning in 2017, Applicant attended swingers\u2019 parties every four to five months. At \nthe hearing, he testified that he stopped attending them in 2020, whereas, during a subject \ninterview, he told the investigator that the last swingers\u2019 party he attended was in February \n2022, ten months after the initiation of the security clearance investigation. (GE 2 at 11) \nOften while at these parties, he had sexual intercourse with strangers.

(Tr. 31) \nAt one of the parties, a woman with whom Applicant had sexual intercourse, \nphotographed him wearing no clothing except for a pair of panties. (AE T at 3) In March \n2021, while at work, Applicant checked his personal email and discovered that the woman \nhe met at the swingers\u2019 party emailed him the picture. (Tr. 15) Applicant tried to delete it, \nbut accidently saved it onto his office\u2019s work drive. (Tr. 15; GE 2 at 5) Because Applicant is \nnot computer literate, he was unable to delete it. Consequently, he asked a female \ncoworker for help. He did not ask a male coworker for help because he was too \nembarrassed. (GE 2 at 12) Before his coworker helped him, he warned her that she might \nfind the photograph offensive. (Tr. 15) She then went into the work drive and deleted the \npicture. (Tr. 16) \nShortly thereafter, the woman who helped Applicant delete the inappropriate picture \nfiled a sexual harassment complaint with their employer. The next day, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer fired him for violating company policy. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3) According to the \ntermination letter, Applicant\u2019s employer also reviewed the contents of Applicant\u2019s computer \nafter the coworker\u2019s complaint and discovered several \u201cobscene and offensive\u201d files. (GE 3) \nWhile on the job, Applicant watched pornography on his telework laptop \napproximately 15 to 20 times. (GE 2 at 6, 13; Tr. 38) He knew that it was against company \npolicy to download pornography onto his work computer, but he did not think that watching \npornography on his work computer while connected to his home internet carrier posed a \nproblem. (Tr. 17, 39) At the time Applicant was fired, he was the company\u2019s facility security \nofficer. (GE 1 at 13) \nApplicant has not watched pornography since May 2020, and he has not attended a \nswingers\u2019 party since February 2022. (Tr. 19, 35; GE 2 at 11) He is ashamed of the pain \nthat he caused his wife and understands that \u201clove is more powerful than any kind of \nfantasy.\u201d (Tr. 24) \nIn late 2022, Applicant told his wife about his swingers\u2019 party attendance. (AE F at 4; \nTr. 33) According to Applicant\u2019s wife, he feels shame and remorse for his behavior, has \ngrown as a person, \u201cand is working hard to develop the skills needed to avoid making such \npoor choices again.\u201d (AE F at 4) Moreover, he is a man of tremendous character who has \nsupported her through her fight with cancer, given a homeless man the shoes off his feet, \nand covered shifts for coworkers in crisis without advance notice. (AE F at 4) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s current supervisors provided a character reference. He is aware \nof Applicant\u2019s past misconduct and stated that it \u201cplay[s] no difference on his role and \nposition at his workplace\u201d because of the stellar judgment he demonstrates on the job. (AE \nF at 2) \nIn July 2023, Applicant voluntarily underwent a psychological evaluation to ascertain \nwhether his behavior, as described above, was indicative of any underlying psychological \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisorder.

(AE T at 6) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s attempt to solicit a prostitute in 1999, his participation in swingers\u2019 club \nparties without his wife\u2019s knowledge, and his perusal of pornography on his work laptop, \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 13(c), sexual behavior that causes an individual to be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and AG \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior . . . that \nreflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d \nThe potentially applicable mitigating guidelines set forth under AG \u00b6 14 are as \nfollows: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation or \nduress. \nApplicant attended swingers\u2019 club parties unbeknownst to his wife for nearly five \nyears, and he did not stop until several months after the completion of his security \nclearance application. Under these circumstances this behavior is too recent for AG \u00b614(b) \nto apply. \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct indirectly led to the loss of his job after another swinger emailed \nhim a compromising picture that Applicant inadvertently saved to his work drive and was \nunable to delete without the assistance of a coworker, who subsequently filed a sexual \nharassment complaint with their employer. Nevertheless, Applicant continued to attend \nthese parties for nearly a year after he was fired, and ten months after the initiation of the \nsecurity clearance investigation. Moreover, although Applicant told his wife about this \nbehavior, he did not do so until late 2022, nearly 18 months after he lost his job. \nConsequently, although Applicant\u2019s disclosure of this behavior constitutes a step in the right \ndirection to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, it is insufficient to \nconclude that this risk has been completely eliminated. I conclude that AG \u00b6 14(c) does not \napply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nIn addition to generating disqualifying conditions under the sexual conduct guideline, \nas discussed above, Applicant\u2019s misconduct, which ultimately contributed to him losing his \njob, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), \u201cengaging in activities which, if known, could \naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Applicant\u2019s use of his \ntelework laptop, in addition to being inappropriate, was a significant misuse of his \nemployer\u2019s time and resources. AG \u00b6 16(d)(4), \u201cevidence of significant misuse of . . . \nemployer\u2019s time or resources,\u201d applies \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant told his wife about his sexual indiscretions and consulted with a \npsychologist, who ruled out sexual deviance as the cause of his behavior. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the damage his behavior caused to his marriage and the pain it \ncaused his wife seemed contrite. In addition, one of Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s is aware of his \npast misconduct. Consequently, AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s testimony about his past sexual misconduct, including his \nexplanation of the circumstances surrounding his citation for soliciting prostitution, and his \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconflicting dates of when he stopped going to swingers\u2019 parties, was not credible. This lack \nof credibility undercuts the probative value of his reassurance that this conduct will not \nrecur. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17(d) only applies partially. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability \nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39) Applicant\u2019s use \nof his telework laptop to view pornography triggers the application of AG \u00b6 40(e), \n\u201cunauthorized use of any information technology system.\u201d \nApplicant viewed pornography on his telework laptop recently. Consequently, AG \u00b6 \n41(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is inapplicable. \nAG \u00b6 41(b) \u201cthe misuse was minor and done solely in the interest or organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness,\u201d and AG \u00b6 41(d), \u201cthe misuse was due to improper or \ninadequate training or unclear instructions,\u201d are not relevant. \nApplicant\u2019s viewing of pornography on his telework laptop was neither unintentional \nnor inadvertent. Moreover, his employer did not know about this conduct until a coworker \ninformed them about the inappropriate picture that Applicant asked her to help him delete. \nAG \u00b6 41(c), \u201cthe conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and followed by a prompt, good-\nfaith effort to correct the situation and by notification to appropriate personnel,\u201d is not \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nWhile Applicant was at a swingers\u2019 club party, another club member took a \ncompromising position of him which she emailed to his personal drive. This ultimately led to \nhis dismissal from employment as Applicant attempted to delete the picture and \ninadvertently saved it to a work drive. As such, it epitomizes the type of unintended \nconsequence that can result from irresponsible, reckless behavior. \nAs recently as February 2022, ten months after Applicant completed his security \nclearance application, he was still attending swingers\u2019 parties without his wife\u2019s knowledge. \nConsequently, given the nature and seriousness of the conduct and its recency, it is too \nsoon to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",
