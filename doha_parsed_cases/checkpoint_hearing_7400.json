On March 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Preference) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 14, 2008. He answered the SOR in writing \non April 16, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on April 21, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non April 30, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 2, 2008.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 7, 2008, scheduling a hearing for May \n15, 2008. The hearing was convened and completed as scheduled. The government \noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without objection. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a list of government exhibits, which was marked Exhibit \n(Ex. VIII). Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough L, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n23, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof the certain facts relating to Taiwan, which has previously been marked Exs. I through \nVII. The request, which contained a country summary, was marked as Ex. IX. Without \nobjection from Applicant, I took administrative notice of the documents (Exs. I through \nVII, IX) offered by Department Counsel, which pertained to Taiwan. (Tr. 13-15).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nTaiwan were derived from Exs. I through VII, IX as indicated under subheading \n\u201cTaiwan\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR \nexcept SOR \u00b6 1.a. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old associate, who has been employed by his defense \ncontractor employer since October 2000. He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was born in the Taiwan in October 1968, where he was raised and \nspent his formative years. He attended college in Taiwan and was awarded a Bachelor \nof Arts degree majoring in economics in June 1991. GE 1. He served almost two years \nof mandatory military service in the Taiwanese Army from July 1991 to June 1993 as an \nofficer. He was honorably discharged as a second lieutenant. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) \n \nIn 1994 at age 26, Applicant came to the U.S. on a student visa to attend \ngraduate school and in June 1996 was awarded an MBA in information systems \nmanagement.  Tr. 62. He subsequently applied for and was granted permanent resident \nalien status (green card), and in November 2005 became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He \nwas issued a U.S. passport in March 2006. GE 1, Tr. 80-81. The SOR alleged Applicant \nis a dual citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) During his background \ninvestigation interview in February 2007, he expressed a willingness to renounce his \nTaiwanese citizenship. GE 2. In his Answer to SOR, he denied he held dual citizenship \nciting documentation from the government of Taiwan that he lost his Taiwanese \ncitizenship when he voluntarily acquired U.S. citizenship. \n \nApplicant married his wife in September 2001. She was born in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), moved to the U.S. with her parents while in grammar school, \nand became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2002.  Applicant and his wife have \ntwo U.S. born daughters, ages five and three. Applicant\u2019s wife is employed as a project \nmanager. Tr. 40, 79.  His in-laws are naturalized U.S. citizens, live in the U.S., and are \nretired. GE 1, GE 2.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are resident citizens of Taiwan. His father is \ndeceased and his mother is a 67-year-old retired housewife. GE 1, Tr. 41-42. His late \nfather worked for a private agriculture company as a biotech engineer. Tr. 42. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. \u2013 1.c.) His mother lives with his 43-year-old brother, discussed infra. Tr. 50-51. \n \nApplicant is the youngest of three brothers.  His oldest brother is a 45-year-old \nmechanical engineer, who works for a private automobile parts company. GE 2, Tr. 43-\n45. He is married, his wife is an accountant for a middle school, and they have one \nminor daughter. GE 2, Tr. 46. His other brother is a 43-year-old elementary school \nteacher. He is married, his wife is a nutritionist employed at an elementary school, and \nthey have two minor sons. GE 2, Tr. 46-49. Applicant\u2019s 45-year-old brother did not serve \nmandatory military service as a result of a physical deferment, and his 43-year-old \nbrother served three years of mandatory military service in the Taiwanese Air Force as \nan enlisted person. Tr. 45, 47-48. \n \nApplicant has a cousin, who is a citizen of Taiwan and is currently attending \ngraduate school in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) Applicant stated his cousin visited him at his \nhome one time. His cousin intends to return to Taiwan upon the completion of his \nstudies. GE 2, Tr. 57-59.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his relatives in Taiwan varies. Referring to the frequency \nand type of contact with his mother in Taiwan, Applicant stated, \u201cProbably once a week. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n. . . by telephone.\u201d Tr. 49. Referring to frequency and type of contact with his two \nbrothers in Taiwan, Applicant stated, \u201cProbably once a quarter or six months. Depends \ntime to time.\u201d His contact with his brothers is by telephone and is usually initiated by \nhim. Tr. 50.  He describes the relationship with his family in Taiwan as \u201cclose.\u201d Tr. 52. \nNo evidence was presented indicating Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in Taiwan \nwere agents of the Taiwanese government. \n \nFrom approximately March 1999 to July 1999, Applicant traveled to Taiwan to \ncare for his father, who was diagnosed with liver cancer. GE 2, AE J, Tr. 51-53. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application identifies eight visits to Taiwan since 2000. \nThey occurred in February 2001, October 2002, February 2003, October 2003, \nFebruary 2004, December 2004, March 2005, and March 2006. With the exception of \nthe March 2005, which was to attend to father\u2019s funeral, the remainder of his visits were \nfor pleasure. (\u00b6 1.g.) GE 1, Tr. 51-52. \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s father passed away, he and his brothers inherited \napproximately 10 acres of farmland in Taiwan. (SOR 1.f.) Applicant\u2019s mother currently \npermits one of his aunts to farm the land. Applicant derives no income from this land \nand is unsure whether he would be able to acquire the property since becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. He \u201cguess[es]\u201d one of his brothers will buy him out. GE 2, Tr. 63-67, 77-78, 81-\n83.  \n \nApplicant estimates his net worth which includes his home, 401Ks, checking and \nsavings accounts at \u201caround half [a] million [dollars].\u201d Tr. 71. He regularly votes and \nenjoys all rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship. He professed his loyalty to the U.S. \nand is very proud to be a U.S. citizen. He enjoys karate, playing the guitar, and \nspending time with his children. \n \nApplicant is an Oracle8 Certified Database Administrator. He submitted one \nwork-related reference letter from a senior associate, and performance evaluations \ncovering the years 2002 to 2007. His reference letter described his work as \n\u201cconsistently outstanding.\u201d His performance evaluations lauded Applicant\u2019s diligent and \ndedicated work performance. AE B \u2013 I.   \n \nTaiwan1 \n \nIn 1949, two million refugees fled to Taiwan from a civil war in mainland China. \nThat same year, Communists in mainland China established the Peoples\u2019 Republic of \nChina (PRC or China), and Chiang Kai-shek established a separate, provisional capital \nfor his government in Taipei, Taiwan. The PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence, and insists that there is only \u201cone China.\u201d After long recognizing Taiwan, \non January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the government of the PRC as the \nsole legal government of China. The U.S. does not support independence for Taiwan \n \n1 The contents of the Taiwan section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I through VII, IX. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand is committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed into \nlaw on April 10, 1979.  \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy that has significant economic contacts with \nChina, and it has developed a strong economy since its separation from the PRC in \n1949. However, Taiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the \nPRC and this has led to Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. The PRC\u2019s Ministry of \nState Security is the \u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and \nmaintains intelligence operations in Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals \nwith Taiwan connections.  \n \n \nTaiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence, and the \nNational Counterintelligence Center (NACIC)\u2019s 2000 Annual Report to Congress on \nForeign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists Taiwan as being among the \nmost active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information. The 2000 Report \nhighlights specific incidents wherein Taiwan engaged in attempts to acquire export-\nrestricted products.  \n \n \nThese collection activities are ongoing, as evidenced by the January 2006 \nconviction and four-year prison sentence of Jonathan C. Sanders on charges related to \nthe theft of sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwanese companies.   \nAdditionally, in December 2005, Donald Keyser, the Principal Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pled guilty to illegally removing \nclassified materials and to providing false statements to the U.S. Government.  Mr. \nKeyser was engaged in a relationship with, and met with, an intelligence officer \nemployed by the National Intelligence Bureau, the foreign intelligence agency of the \ngovernment of Taiwan. \n \nThe PRC maintains active intelligence operations in Taiwan utilizing PRC \nnationals with Taiwan connections. The PRC is a nuclear power with vast resources,  \nand the PRC aggressively competes with the United States in a variety of areas. PRC\u2019s \ncompetitive relationship with the United States exacerbates the risk posed by \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Taiwan.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nsense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) \nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nAnalysis \n  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nIf the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontacts with his mother and siblings, who are resident citizens of Taiwan. Applicant \nvisited his family numerous times since he emigrated to the U.S. in 1994, and owns \nproperty in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his immediate family creates a \nsignificant risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because Taiwan has an \nactive information collection program.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s family and Taiwanese property, and the burden \nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. As previously \nindicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AGs \u00b6 84 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n \n4 Dual citizenship and service in the Taiwanese Army would have been more correctly alleged \nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference) inasmuch as those concerns are specifically addressed either in \nthe disqualifying and/or mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based solely on his parents\u2019 \ncitizenship and birth in Taiwan. He expressed a willingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship as well \nas offering unrebutted evidence that he lost his Taiwanese citizenship by operation of Taiwanese law \nwhen he became a U.S. citizen. His mandatory military service in the Taiwanese Army occurred before he \nbecame a U.S. citizen. If alleged under Guideline C, these facts allow application of AGs 11(a) \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\u201d (b) \u201cthe individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\u201d and (c) \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or \nobligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor.\u201d Applying the Guidelines, I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.e. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply to his relationships with his parents and two \nsiblings in Taiwan. Applicant maintains frequent contact with these immediate relatives, \nsome more than others, and this frequent contact supports the conclusion his \nrelationship with them is close. In 1999, he returned to Taiwan for approximately five \nmonths after learning his father was diagnosed with liver cancer. Since 2000, he has \nvisited Taiwan eight times. These facts are indicia of the nature of his relationship with \nthese family members, and that such contact is not casual and infrequent.    \n \nApplicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of [his immediate family members] and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts with them could potentially force him to choose between \nthe United States and Taiwan. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle \nlikelihood that [his relationship with his immediate family members] could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a significant \nrelationship and loyalty to the U.S. He has continuously lived in the United States since \n1994.

Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d5 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.

Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.6 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.

Jan. 5, 2007).  \n  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 14 years, and he has been a \nnaturalized citizen for almost three years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore \nallegiance to the United States. His wife is also a naturalized U.S citizen and his two \nchildren are U.S. born citizens. He has emphasized his loyalty to the U.S. and how \nmuch he values and enjoys his life in the U.S. There is no evidence he has ever taken \nany action which could cause potential harm to the U.S. He takes his loyalty to the U.S. \nvery seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense contractor for seven years. \nHis financial in the U.S. are much more substantial than his financial ties to Taiwan. No \nderogatory evidence was developed against him. The evidence points to the fact that \nApplicant is a decent, honest, loyal and productive member of society. \n \nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First, \nTaiwan actively seeks classified and industrial/economic information. Taiwan may \nattempt to use his immediate relatives who live in Taiwan to obtain such information. \nThis may occur notwithstanding his family members\u2019 assertion that they would resist \nsuch overtures. Second, Applicant had significant connections to Taiwan before he \nemigrated to the U.S. in 1994 at age 26. He was born there and spent his formative \nyears there. Third, he has immediate family members consisting of his mother and two \nsiblings, who are resident citizens of Taiwan. Fourth, Applicant has frequent and non-\ncasual contact with his immediate family members as evidenced by his frequent \ntelephone contact as well as his eight visits to Taiwan since 2000. These contacts are \nmanifestations of his strong affection and regard for his immediate family members, \nespecially his mother. Fifth, he owns property in Taiwan. \n \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd.

Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  This is a close case, but \nultimately the evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and \nsuitability. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 28, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The SOR\nalleges security concerns under Guideline C for foreign preference. For the reasons\ndiscussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJune 3, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n3\nherein. \n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n4\n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was signed by him on February 5, 2008, and he\nindicated he did not wish to have a hearing. His reply or answer consisted of his\nhandwritten responses on the SOR. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn March 25, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant on March 31  and it was received\n3\nst\nby him on April 8 . He did not reply to the FORM within the allowed 30-day period. The\nth\ncase was assigned to me on May 27, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nFirst, in its FORM, the government moved to amend SOR as follows: (1) to add \u00b6\n2 setting forth a security concern under Guideline B for foreign influence; (2) to add \u00b6 3\nsetting forth a security concern under Guideline E for personal conduct; (3) to delete \u00b6\n1.c and replace it as \u00b6 2.a under Guideline B; and (4) to delete \u00b6 1.b and replace it as \u00b6\n3.a under Guideline E. The motion appears to be in order because it conforms to the\nevidence and for other good cause (to allege two additional security guidelines). As\nApplicant did not reply to the FORM, he likewise did not reply to the motion.\nAccordingly, the motion to amend is granted. For clarity, the factual allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, and 3.a will be described in the findings of fact.  \nSecond, the government included in its FORM as an item of documentary\nevidence an account of an interview of Applicant (Exhibit 5). The interview was part of a\nreport of investigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The\nROI indicates that the Applicant\u2019s interview was an unsworn declaration made in April\n2007. \nThe general rule is that a background ROI may not be received and considered\nby an administrative judge.  The exception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be\n4\n\n Id. \n5\n FORM at 5. \n6\n3\nreceived with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  \n5\nIn past cases, the government included an ROI in its FORM without an attempt to\nauthenticate it or offer some other method of getting the evidence to the trier of fact (for\nexample, stipulation). The ROI was excluded from consideration in those cases. Here,\nthe government authenticated the ROI through Applicant. In particular, in about\nDecember 2007, it issued an interrogatory asking Applicant to review the ROI and state\nif it accurately reflected the information he provided during the interview (Exhibit 5).\nApplicant indicated it did, and he did not provide any additional information about the\ninterview. Accordingly, without objections, the ROI is admitted as a business record or a\npublic record or both and it will be considered.\nThird, in its FORM, the government requested that official or administrative notice\nbe taken of information about Mexico and referred to two documents from the State\nDepartment (Exhibit 6\u2013background note and Exhibit 7\u2013travel warning).  The request did\n6\nnot specify the particular facts to be noticed. Both documents are voluminous (12 and\n13 pages) and address diverse and multiple subjects. It is not the role of an\nadministrative judge to review these documents and select the particular facts that are\nrelevant to the government\u2019s case. Accordingly, the request to take official or\nadministrative notice is denied due to its lack of specificity.  \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee who is a native-born U.S. citizen. He has\nworked for his current employer since April 2002. His current position or job title is tech\ntrainer. His employment history includes active duty military service as well as service in\na state national guard. \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in January 2007 (Exhibit 4).\nIn it, he reported that he has lived in a border town in Mexico since about April 2003,\nand that he lives there due to the low cost of living (Exhibit 4 at 2, 9). He crosses the\nU.S.\u2013Mexico border daily whenever he commutes to and from work. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has resided in Mexico since about April 2003\ndespite that he is a U.S. citizen employed in the U.S. Applicant admits this allegation in\nhis Answer. In addition, it is established by the information in his security-clearance\napplication noted above.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n7\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n8\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n9\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n11\n4\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant currently resides with a girlfriend and her son,\nboth of whom are Mexican citizens, in Mexico. Applicant admits this allegation in his\nAnswer. In addition, it is established by the information in his security-clearance\napplication and the summary of his interview (Exhibit 5). He lives with his girlfriend, an\nunemployed housewife, and her son. He has weekly contact with his girlfriend\u2019s\nimmediate family, and Applicant has contact with the girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband whenever\nthe ex-husband visits his son. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that during the April 2007 interview with an authorized\ninvestigator for the Defense Department, Applicant stated that he does not have\nMexican residency. The allegation does not assert that this statement is false or\nmisleading, but that is the implication based on reading the FORM in its entirety.\nApplicant denies this allegation in his Answer. He explained that he made it clear to the\ninvestigator that he lived in Mexico, but has a post office box in the U.S. According to\nthe summary of his interview, Applicant stated that he does not have Mexican\ncitizenship or residency (Exhibit 5 at 2).  As noted above, Applicant disclosed the fact\nthat he has lived in Mexico since 2003 in his security-clearance application. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.7\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n8\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n9\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about\n10\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved\nin favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n15\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines at 5\u20136 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n19\n5\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n17\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nThe foreign influence and foreign preference guidelines will be addressed\ntogether because they are factually related. Under Guideline B for foreign influence,  a\n18\nsecurity concern may arise due to foreign contacts and interests \u201cif the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests,\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  And under Guideline\n19\n\n Revised Guidelines at 7\u20138 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 7. \n21\n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n22\n Revised Guidelines at 6\u20138. \n23\n6\nC for foreign preference,  a security concern may arise \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in\n20\nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then\nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d21\nFor foreign influence, there are two disqualifying conditions  under Guideline B\n22\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\nDC 1. [C]ontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nDC 4. [S]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nBoth of these DC apply based on the following facts: (1) Applicant lives in Mexico; (2)\nApplicant lives with a girlfriend who is a Mexican citizen and resident; and (3) Applicant\nhas contact with Mexican border officials whenever he crosses the border.\nFor foreign preference, none of the four specific DC under Guideline C apply to\nthe facts of this case. But the fact that Applicant has chosen to live in Mexico with a\nMexican girlfriend falls within the concern expressed under Guideline C because these\nactions indicate a preference for Mexico over the United States. Whatever Applicant\u2019s\nmotivation for living in Mexico may be, his actions nonetheless raise a security concern.\nBoth guidelines contain conditions that may mitigate the security concerns.  I\n23\nreviewed the MC under each guideline and conclude none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nHis ties and connections to Mexico are substantial and ongoing, and there is no\nindication things will change in the future. The evidence shows this is a case of divided\ninterests because Applicant has, both literally and figuratively, one foot in Mexico and\none foot in the United States. This is not a case where an applicant is living in a foreign\ncountry as a condition of his employment. Instead, Applicant has decided to live in\nMexico for his own reasons. Although his situation is not illegal or immoral, his ties and\nconnections to Mexico are not clearly consistent with the national interest of the U.S.\nAccordingly, Guidelines B and C are decided against Applicant. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n24\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n25\n7\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n24\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n25\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nIn dispute here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s statement about whether or not\nhe has residency in Mexico when he said he did not in his April 2007 interview. This\nallegation is supported by the summary of his interview (Exhibit 5 at 2). But Applicant\ndenies this allegation and explained that he made his position clear to the investigator.\nResolving this dispute is hampered by the summarized nature of Applicant\u2019s interview\n(as compared with a verbatim sworn statement) and the lack of a hearing where this\nmatter could have explored in detail. In addition, the evidence is crystal clear that\nApplicant disclosed that he has lived in Mexico since 2003 when he completed his\nsecurity-clearance application, which predates the interview. It is difficult to imagine how\nthe government could have been mislead or deceived in light of his disclosure. Based\non this skimpy record, the evidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant deliberately\nmade a false or misleading statement during the April 2007 interview. Accordingly,\nGuideline E is decided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the amended SOR, DOHA alleges under Guideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant was terminated from a job he had held from January 1987 to about March 2006 for an ethics violation in that he knowingly receiving shift-differential pay of approximately $36,000 to which he was not entitled (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he misrepresented to company personnel in February 2006 that he worked the night shift (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he told his family that he had been laid off rather than that he had been terminated due to an ethics violation (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have been granted a discharge of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in about 1995 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to owe about $16,000 in delinquent debt over 180 days as of May 8, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the Guideline E and Guideline F allegations. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. 3 Applicant is a 45-year-old test technician who requires a secret-level security clearance for his duties (Ex. 1, Tr. 23). He served in the U.S. military from October 1982 to October 1986 where he held a top secret security clearance (Tr. 22, 24). In January 1987, he began working for a defense contractor as a test technician (Ex. 1, Tr. 26). He was eventually promoted to an engineering technician position (Tr. 26). In 1995, Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His debts were discharged, and he was allowed to keep his secret security clearance (Tr. 25-26, 52)",

On December 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E as the basis for its decision to deny his request for\na security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 22, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 5, 2008, and on April 18,\n2008, I scheduled a hearing for May 8, 2008. The parties appeared for the hearing as\nJuly 3, 2008\n\nTwo government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) were admitted, and Applicant testified as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\n1\nreceived by DOHA on May 19, 2008.\nOn June 10, 2008, Applicant informed me in a voice mail message that he planned to apply for a grant to\n2\nobtain the funds to address his debts. During a conference call with the parties on June 11, 2008, I extended\nthe deadline to his response to June 24, 2008.\n2\nscheduled. After the parties presented their evidence,  the SOR was amended on the\n1\ngovernment\u2019s motion to add security concerns under Guideline F. For the reasons set\nforth below, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nBased on Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony on May 8, 2008, the government moved\nto amend the SOR at the hearing to allege Guideline F, financial considerations\nconcerns under a new SOR \u00b6 2, as follows:\na. You filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in approximately 1995. As a result,\nyour bankruptcy was granted, and your debts were discharged.\nb. You are currently over 180 days delinquent on various debts totaling\napproximately $16,0000. As of May 8, 2008, those debts have not been\npaid.\nApplicant did not object and the motion was granted. Applicant was given 20\ndays from receipt of written notice of the specific allegations to file his response, either\nadmit or deny with or without explanation and/or supporting documentation. On May 13,\n2008, Department Counsel set forth the allegations in a written motion to amend, which\nwas received by Applicant on May 19, 2008. On June 11, 2008, the deadline for any\nsubmissions was extended to June 24, 2008, at Applicant\u2019s request and with no\nobjections from the government.  Applicant submitted no new evidence by the due date.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleges under Guideline E, personal conduct, that\nApplicant was terminated from a job he had held from January 1987 to about March\n2006 for an ethics violation in that he knowingly receiving shift-differential pay of\napproximately $36,000 to which he was not entitled (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he\nmisrepresented to company personnel in February 2006 that he worked the night shift\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he told his family that he had been laid off rather than that he had\nbeen terminated due to an ethics violation (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline F, Applicant is\nalleged to have been granted a discharge of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in about 1995\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to owe about $16,000 in delinquent debt over 180 days as of May 8,\n2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the Guideline E and Guideline F allegations. After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\n\n3\nApplicant is a 45-year-old test technician who requires a secret-level security\nclearance for his duties (Ex. 1, Tr.  23). He served in the U.S. military from October\n1982 to October 1986 where he held a top secret security clearance (Tr. 22, 24). In\nJanuary 1987, he began working for a defense contractor as a test technician (Ex. 1, Tr.\n26). He was eventually promoted to an engineering technician position (Tr. 26). \nIn 1995, Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His debts were discharged,\nand he was allowed to keep his secret security clearance (Tr. 25-26, 52).\nIn July 2004, Applicant was scheduled to switch from the first shift to the second\nshift at work where he would be entitled to shift-differential pay. The differential\namounted to 12 percent of his then $16 hourly wage (Tr. 26-27). Applicant was paid the\ndifferential in addition to his salary for about 18 months, even though he did not switch\nto the second shift. Applicant noticed almost immediately that he was paid the\ndifferential that he was not entitled to (Tr. 27-28). Applicant claims that after about four\nto six weeks, he notified his supervisor, who promised to look into it (Tr. 28). Applicant\ndid not inform payroll or human resources of the error (Tr. 29), and when the matter\ncame to the attention of Applicant\u2019s employer, his supervisor did not corroborate his\nclaim of a relatively timely notification (Tr. 42-43).\nIn about January or February 2006, Applicant was contacted by an employee in\nthe human resources\u2019 department about submitting to a random urinalysis. When she\nasked him about his work hours, Applicant falsely replied that he worked the second\nshift but happened to be on the first shift the day she called. (Tr. 32-33). Applicant\nattributes his \u201cwrong decision\u201d to not knowing what to say since he \u201cwas in a bad\nsituation.\u201d Following an investigation, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from his\nemployment of almost 20 years for violating his employer\u2019s ethics policy (Ex. 1, Ex. 2,\nTr. 34). He was also required to repay the differential monies, which amounted to about\n$3,600 (Tr. 34). Applicant took out a loan from his 401(k) to pay his former employer\n(Tr. 35). He told his parents that he had been laid off from his job because he was\nembarrassed and ashamed for having taken the pay and he did not want to add to their\nproblems (Tr. 35-36). As of May 2008, he still had not told his family that he had been\nfired from his previous job in March 2006 (Tr. 36).\nFrom March to May 2006, Applicant worked as a contract environmental\ntechnician for another defense contractor at $20 an hour (Tr. 49). During the June/July\n2006 time frame, Applicant worked only for about a week or so, as a technician for a\nmedical device company (Ex. 1, Tr. 36).\nIn August 2006, Applicant began working as a security guard for his current\nemployer (Ex. 1) at about $17 per hour (Tr. 44). He took the job after he was informed\nthere would be an opportunity within a few months to be placed as a contract test\ntechnician with a defense contractor (Tr. 24). Needing classified access to at least the\nsecret level for his expected duties testing products for military applications (Tr. 23),\nApplicant executed an e-QIP on September 9, 2006. He disclosed on his e-QIP that he\nhad been fired from a company in March 2006 for an ethics violation (Ex. 1). In August\n\n4\n2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about his termination.\nApplicant admitted he had been terminated for taking shift-differential pay to which he\nwas not entitled. He took no action himself to stop the payments but claimed he had\ninformed his supervisor of the payroll error. Applicant also admitted that he had lied in\nJanuary 2006 when he indicated during a random urinalysis test that he worked the\nnight shift. Applicant added that he repaid the $3,600 in shift pay in May 2006 (Ex. 2).\nApplicant also averred that his former supervisor and human resource personnel are the\nonly persons aware of his firing. He had told his family he had been laid off rather than\nfired from his previous job because he was embarrassed about what he had done (Ex.\n2).\nApplicant has been laid off from his contract test technician position four times\nover the past 18 months, with the longest layoff lasting about three weeks (Tr. 41-42).\nHe was out of work as of May 2008 but was scheduled to report back May 8, 2008 (Tr.\n14). \nApplicant has had ongoing problems with his finances since his bankruptcy\ndischarge in 1995 (Tr. 31). He took out cash advances to pay his day-to-day living\nexpenses, including rent, over the years (Tr. 45-46, 52). He made timely payments on\nsome accounts, including for a television he bought in May 2007 for $700 (Tr. 51), but\nother accounts became delinquent. In summer 2007, he entered into a debt\nmanagement agreement to repay delinquent obligations. He kept up with payments for\nabout ten months but he fell behind when he again found himself out of work. After he\nfailed to make a couple payments, the company terminated the agreement (Tr. 44-45).\nApplicant shares a townhouse with one roommate (Tr. 45), so his share of the\nrent is $650 per month (Tr. 50). He is not behind on his share of the utilities, but he\nowes about $26,000 in credit card debt from the cash advances taken out to pay his\nliving expenses since 1995 (Tr. 45-46, 52). He is paying double the minimum amount on\nmost of his credit card accounts, but two of the accounts with an aggregate debt\nbalance of about $16,000 are more than 180 days past due (Tr. 46-47). Applicant\nincurred unexpected medical expenses in the past year. He just paid off the ambulance\ndebt (Tr. 50), and while he owes about $1,000 for two medical bills, he has been making\nthose payments on time (Tr. 50-51).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\n\n5\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n6\n           For about 18 months from 2004 to about February 2006, Applicant was paid\nshift-differential pay that he was not entitled to as a first shift employee. There is no\nindication that he initially set out to defraud his employer, but once he noticed the error,\nhe had an ethical, if not also a legal obligation, to notify his employer. Applicant almost\nimmediately noticed that he had been paid shift-differential pay amounting to an\nadditional 12 percent of his hourly rate. He claims that about four to six weeks later, he\ninformed his supervisor who promised to look into the erroneous payments. The\nsupervisor did not corroborate this claimed notification during the company\u2019s\ninvestigation into the overpayments. Any notification would have excused inaction by\nApplicant for only about an additional month or so while he waited for his supervisor to\nlook into it. Given his unethical behavior continued until he was caught in a lie about his\nshift work in 2006, he bears a heavy burden of overcoming the personal conduct\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16(d):\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include\nbreach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release\nof sensitive or corporate or other government protected information; (2) disruptive,\nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern or dishonesty or\nrule violations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s\ntime or resources.\nFurthermore, his deliberate misrepresentation about his shift hours when called\nfor the random urinalysis implicates AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to any employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d Since\nhe still has not told his family about his termination for cause from his previous job,\nsecurity concerns are also raised under AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment\nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. . . .\u201c\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts,\u201d would have required at a minimum timely notification of the\npayroll error and follow up. Assuming he notified his supervisor within four to six weeks\nof the shift differential pay issue, his continued silence for an additional 16 or 17 months\nand his deliberate misrepresentation when called for the urinalysis undermine any claim\nto a good-faith rectification. Moreover, while Applicant has expressed remorse for his\nmisconduct (\u201cI fully admit I made a mistake in my judgment and I totally feel that I feel\n\n7\nvery regretful about my situation. And basically I, what I did wasn\u2019t right and I fully admit\nit . . .  \u201c Tr. 13), doubts persist for his judgment where he still refers to the payroll issue\nas something that happened to him (\u201cI am just very sorry that I had this thing happen to\nme . . .  I\u2019m very choked up about this, what happened to me. . . .\u201c Tr. 21; \u201cI was, I told\nmy supervisor about it and, at one time or another, it just never came off of the books,\nand I mentioned it once or twice to my supervisor. However, after a various amount of\ntime, it never went off, so I kept it for myself and then, unfortunately, it became a\nsituation where I had the urinalysis test.\u201d Tr. 27). Applicant was not put in the  situation\nof having to conceal his ethical violations. He chose that avenue for himself, and to the\nextent he still views it as unfortunate, he shows little appreciation for his obligation of full\ncandor. Applicant now acknowledges that he should have told the truth in 2006 (\u201cI\nshould have told the truth back then. Regretfully, it cost me 20 years of a good job . . . .\u201d\nTr. 39), but again the focus is on what it cost him rather than on how he betrayed the\ntrust of the government, his employer, and/or his supervisor by his serious ethical\nlapses.\nAG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d also is not pertinent even\nas he acknowledges he made a serious mistake. Applicant claims he panicked when he\nrealized he was still receiving the differential (Tr. 29), but he also admits that he was\nhaving difficulty making ends meet at the time (Tr. 31). Financial stressors cannot be\nruled out as a contributing factor in his failure to correct the payroll error and those\nfinancial pressures still exist (see Guideline F, infra). Applicant owes more than $16,000\nin consumer credit debt that is more than 180 days past due.\nFinally, Applicant has done nothing to address the vulnerability concerns that\nexist because of his efforts to conceal his involuntary termination from his family\nmembers. AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d does not apply.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted at his hearing that the special access that he held at the time\nwas revoked following a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 1995 (Tr. 25, 52). He\ncontinued to experience financial difficulties, and had problems making ends meet in\n\n8\n2004/05 during the time that he continued to accept the shift-differential pay. By May\n2008, he had accumulated about $26,000 in consumer credit debt, about $16,000 of\nwhich was more than 180 days past due (Tr. 47-48). Security concerns are raised under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debt,\u201d and \u00b6 19 (c) \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant does not deny his ongoing financial struggles (\u201cI was not getting my\npay so right now I am in destitute, right now.\u201d Tr. 44). Last summer he apparently\nentered into a debt repayment plan to resolve his delinquent debt (see AG \u00b6 20(d),  \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d), but the plan was canceled after he missed two payments due to a job layoff.\nApplicant testified with no evidence to the contrary that he has been laid off four times in\nthe past 18 months (Tr. 41), and he had unexpected medical costs within the past year\n(Tr. 50-51). He just paid off an ambulance bill but owes about $1,000 on two other\nmedical debts that have been consolidated. He was given about six weeks after his\nhearing to prove a case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Nothing\nwas submitted by the deadline. An unacceptable security risk exists because of his\nongoing financial pressures.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant exercised extremely poor judgment by failing to correct a payroll error.\n\n9\nHe compounded the personal conduct concerns by lying about his shift hours in\nFebruary 2006 out of fear that his unethical behavior would be discovered, and he still\nhas not been candid with his family about his job loss. He has had ongoing financial\nproblems since before 1995 due in part to lack of income, but his use of consumer\ncredit card cash advances to pay for his living expenses raises considerable doubts\nabout his ability to handle his finances responsibly. I am unable to conclude that\nApplicant possesses the requisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that\nmust be demanded of those with access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n_________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 20, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 29, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and \nrevised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other \ndeterminations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nAugust 13, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                              \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 22, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. \nApplicant submitted an undated supplemental response, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. DOHA received his second \nundated response on April 8, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM), dated April 30, 2008, was provided to him, and he was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation.2 Applicant did not submit any information within the 30-day time period \nafter receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 22, \n2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations, and submitted explanations \nwith his Answer. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old flight line mechanic, who has worked for his \ndefense contractor employer since August 1970. His February 2007 e-QIP \nindicates that he was granted a top secret clearance in April 1982.3  \n \nApplicant was previously married from August 1968 to May 1989. That \nmarriage ended by divorce. He has been married to his second wife since May \n1993. Applicant has two adult children, a son and a daughter. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his e-QIP,4 his March 2007 consolidated report of credit,5 \n \nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was \nissued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.

According to Applicant\u2019s credit reports, his financial problems \nbegan around 2002 \u2013 2003. Applicant offered no documentation that any of his \ndebts have been paid, that he has set up payment plans, nor has he submitted \nany evidence that he contacted any creditors. In his Answer, Applicant explained \nthat his wife \u201clost over 300,000 dollars\u201d from her 401k, that his mother, who was \nliving with him and paying him $600 per month passed away, that his adult \ndaughter and her children moved in with him during her divorce, and that he \nhelped support them.9 The details surrounding these events are limited. The \nrecord does not contain any documentation corroborating Applicant\u2019s explanations \nnor does the record contain any character evidence. \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28(a) and 28(b) (asking whether in \nthe last seven years he had been 180 days delinquent on any debt, and whether \nhe was currently 90 days delinquent on any debts, (respectively)). He failed to \ndisclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. Applicant denied that he \ndeliberately provided false responses to these questions. Applicant claims that \n\u201c[he] didn\u2019t know [he] owed any of them (creditors).\u201d10 I note at a minimum that his \nbank repossessed his boat in 2002 leaving a $25,151 deficiency after the bank \nauctioned the boat off. Applicant claims \u201cI never heard from them (the bank) \nagain.\u201d11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \n \n \n5 Item 7. \n \n6 Item 8. \n \n7 Item 9. \n \n8 Item 10. \n \n9 Item 3. \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d12 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).13 \n \n \n12 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing \ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being \nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 \n(1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n13 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable \nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent \nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion \nunder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, \n1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),14 the Government\u2019s concern \nis that an Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating \nback to 2002. Since then, he has accumulated at least four delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $37,986. He presented no evidence to show he has taken \nany action to resolve his debts. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition \n(FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,15 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented no evidence documenting efforts \ntaken to contact creditors, or to resolve any of the debts since he acquired them. \nNor is there any evidence that he has participated in any financial counseling. I \n \n14  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n15  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are \nconsidered as a whole. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nspecifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \nGuidelines \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and conclude it does \nnot apply.  \n \nHe presented no evidence to show he dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, \nsettlements, documented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial \nassistance/counseling). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable \nevidence preclude a finding that he has established a track record of financial \nresponsibility, or that he has taken control of his financial situation. Based on the \navailable evidence, his financial problems are likely to be a concern in the future. \nMoreover, his financial problems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing.  \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct),16 conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any \nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for failing to disclose truthful responses to \nquestions 28(a), and 28(b) is not credible. Considering the record as a whole, I \nam convinced Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the information. Numerous \nfactors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant=s \nage, his level of education, his employment history, the number and value of the \ndebts, his long term disregard of the debts, and the lack of credibility of his \nexcuses. He knew the importance of accurate completion of his security clearance \napplication, and nevertheless failed to provide information that was material to \nmaking an informed security decision. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 16(a): \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire . . ., and DC 16(e): personal conduct or \nconcealment of information about one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress . . ., apply. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and \nconclude that none apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and his limited \nfavorable information is not sufficient to apply any of the MCs. Additionally, for the \nsame reasons outlined under the discussions of Guidelines F, incorporated \n \n \n16 Guideline & 15 \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nherein, I conclude Applicant=s behavior shows questionable judgment, lack of \nreliability, and untrustworthiness.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security \nconcerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole person \nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a \nfavorable decision. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from him \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nnot clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The SOR\n1\nalleges security concerns under Guideline C (foreign preference). Applicant submitted a\nresponse to the SOR that was received by DOHA on April 8, 2008. She admitted all SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 8, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJune 2, 2008, scheduling the hearing to be conducted by video tele-conference on June\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJuly 16, 2008\n\n Applicant was contacted by Department Counsel on or before May 14, 2008, and was notified of and\n2\nagreed to the hearing date of June 12, 2008. Delay in issuance of the formal Notice of Hearing was caused\nby the administrative requirements of securing a video tele-conference location and connection in Germany.\n2\n12, 2008.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted two\n2\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. Those\ndocuments were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified but did not\noffer any other evidence. The transcript was received on June 23, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 28-year-old single woman who has been employed in Germany as an\nadministrative assistant/office manager by a defense contractor since August 2005. Her\nprevious employment history in Germany consisted of working as an automobile rental\nagent from July 2004 to August 2005, again as an automobile rental agent from July 2003\nto March 2004, and as a car salesperson from September 2001 to July 2003. She was\nunemployed from March 2004 to July 2004. She has never possessed a security\nclearance.\nApplicant attended school in Germany from the third grade on. Her formal education\nended in August 2001 when she received the German equivalent of an associates degree\nin certified administration/finance liaison. She served an apprenticeship with a German\nautomobile dealer while attending this last school. The apprenticeship was with the same\nemployer she began working for in September 2001. The schooling and apprenticeship\nprogram allowed her to not pay anything additional other than her apprenticeship services\nfor her advanced education.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a German citizen and resident. Her mother married her father\nwho was an American serviceman was stationed in Germany at the time. Applicant was\nborn in Germany and moved with her parents to the United States when her father was\nreassigned here. She resided with both parents in the U.S. until they divorced when\nApplicant was about eight years old. Applicant attended the first and second grades of\nelementary school in the U.S. but returned to Germany with her mother following her\nparents\u2019 divorce. \nApplicant acquired dual U.S./German citizenship based on her parents\u2019 citizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a registered alien in the U.S. but has resided solely in Germany for\nthe past twenty years. Applicant has one brother who is a dual U.S./German citizen and\nwho resides in Germany. She has a half-sister who is solely a German citizen and who\nresides in Germany. Applicant  has continuously resided in Germany since she was about\neight years old. She has a U.S. passport that was issued in May 2003. She had a German\npassport that expired in April 2003 that she has not renewed. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n3\nApplicant votes in German elections but has never voted in a U.S. election. As\nrequired by German law, she pays taxes in Germany and contributes to German retirement\nand healthcare systems. She receives required medical care through the German\nhealthcare system. \nApplicant does not know where her father resides and has no contact with him. She\nvisited the U.S. for about three weeks in 2001 with a boyfriend who was a member of the\nU.S. military stationed in Germany. She visited again in March 2008 with her current\nboyfriend who is also a member of the U.S. military stationed in Germany. \nHer current boyfriend is not scheduled to return to the U.S. until 2011. They have\nknown each other for about two years and been dating for about one year. They have\ndiscussed marriage but have not made any formal commitment. The purpose of her March\n2008 visit to the U.S. was to allow her to meet his relatives. He has not decided whether\nor not to make the military a career. If he decides to remain in the military, she is willing to\nrelocate from Germany with him. If he decides to leave the military, they would like to\nremain in Germany.      \nApplicant has expressed her willingness to renounce her German citizenship if it is\nnecessary to allow her to keep her present employment. However, she believes it would\nbe difficult for her to remain in Germany if she renounced her German citizenship. She\ntestified she would have to obtain German work and residence permits to remain in\nGermany and thought she might instead be required to leave that country. (Tr. 36)  \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline C (foreign preference),\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant has continuously resided in Germany since she was eight years old. She\nhas been educated in German schools since the third grade. She has worked exclusively\nin Germany. She votes in German elections, pays German taxes, and contributes to\nGerman retirement and healthcare systems. She receives all medical care through the\nGerman healthcare system. All her immediate relatives, with the exception of her father\nwhose place of residence is unknown, are either sole of dual citizens of Germany. All her\nimmediate relatives, again with the apparent exception of her father, are residents of\nGermany.\n \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: . . . (3) accepting educational, medical,\n\n5\nretirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country . . . (7) voting in a\nforeign election apply.\nApplicant\u2019s German citizenship is based upon her mother\u2019s citizenship. Applicant\nwas an eight-year-old child when her mother decided to return to and reside in Germany\nwith Applicant and her brother following her divorce from Applicant\u2019s father. Mitigating\nCondition (MC) 11(a): dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country applies. Additionally, although conditionally and somewhat reluctantly,\nApplicant has expressed a willingness to renounce her German citizenship. Accordingly,\nshe is entitled to some limited application of MC 11(b): the individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship. The remaining mitigating conditions have no\napplicability to the facts of this case.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d There is no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal American citizen nor to\nquestion the sincerity of her expressions of undivided loyalty to the United States.\nHowever, weighing against Applicant\u2019s unquestioned loyalty to the United States are\nher overwhelming connections to Germany. She has resided in Germany for the past 20\nyears. She has been educated and worked in Germany since she was eight years old. All\nher immediate relatives, with the exception of her father whose whereabouts are unknown,\nare residents of Germany and either sole or dual citizens of Germany. Applicant\u2019s only\ncontact with the United States over the past twenty years has been the acquisition of a\nU.S. passport and two visits of about three weeks duration to the U.S. with American\nservicemen who she met while they were stationed in Germany. While she testified she\nis willing to relocate anywhere her current boyfriend wants or needs to go if they marry, she\nalso testified their joint desire is to reside in Germany if he decides to leave military service.\n  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nincluding the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the\nDirective, the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant\u2019s strong and\nlong-standing ties to Germany, her minimal ties to the U.S., and her expressed preference\nto continue her German residence, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign\npreference security concern that exists in this case. She has failed to overcome the case\nagainst her or satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline C is decided against\nApplicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on January 2, 2008. He\nadmitted all SOR allegations except the allegation contained in subparagraph 1.e, and\nrequested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on January 25, 2008, and\nwas reassigned to me on February 8, 2008, to be heard in conjunction with other hearings\nI had scheduled in the same city. A notice of hearing was issued on February 27, 2008,\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\nscheduling the hearing for March 19, 2008. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The\ngovernment submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted 14 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-14,\nand admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on March 28,\n2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 36 years old and has been employed as an engineer by defense\ncontractors since August 2005. He was awarded a bachelor of science degree in electrical\nengineering in December 1994. He was employed as a team leader by a tobacco company\nfrom March 1996 to July 2002, when he quit to start a telecommunications business with\nhis brother. That endeavor failed and Applicant closed the business in February 2005. He\nwas unemployed until April 2005, when he obtained employment as a car salesman, which\nemployment he maintained until being hired into his present position. He was granted an\ninterim security clearance in December 2005.\nApplicant has been married since August 1995. He has one 16-year-old child, and\ntwins who are 12 years old. Applicant and his wife separated in either January or February\n2002, and reunited in August 2004. They shared custody of their children during the\nseparation and Applicant also provided his wife and children with financial support.\nApplicant and his family resided in a mobile home he is purchasing until they bought their\ncurrent house in 2006. Applicant\u2019s mother now resides in the mobile home. He pays the\nmortgage payment on that residence, and she pays the other expenses and assists with\nthe care of his children in return therefore. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he attempted to start the\ntelecommunications business. A large part of that business was intended to furnish\nservices in countries located in the Middle East which proved unsuccessful following the\nstart of the coalition war in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s annual income fell from approximately $70,000\nin 2001 to about $25-30,000 in the years after he resigned from the tobacco company.\nAlthough he had accumulated about $40,000 in savings before launching this business\nenterprise and his wife was earning approximately $20,000 per year, he soon found it\nnecessary to pay a large portion of their living expenses by using credit cards in an effort\nto make the business a success while maintaining the lifestyle they had established. \nThe SOR alleges five collection accounts, totaling $23,436, one account that was\ncharged off as a bad debt, in the amount of $6,701, and delinquent federal taxes, in the\namount of $2,406.46. Applicant satisfied the charged off account, SOR subparagraph 1.b,\nby paying an agreed upon settlement of $4,747.43, which represented 50% of the total\nowed, including interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and court costs. (AE 8 & 11). He entered into a\nrepayment agreement on the delinquent taxes, SOR subparagraph 1.g, and that debt is\nnow fully satisfied. (GE 2 & AE 9)\n\n Although the court file numbers listed in AE 6 and AE 10 are different, the creditor account number\n2\ncontained in AE 10 (9943242), reflecting an overpayment on the account and a refund to the debtor, is\nidentical to the creditor account number contained in the credit report included as part of GE 2. Thus, whether\nAE 6 is a receipt showing payment of the amount due on the account in accord with Applicant\u2019s testimony or\nnot, AE 10 independently establishes the debt has been fully satisfied.  \n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n3\nApplicant has satisfied the collection accounts alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d\n(owed in the amount of $1,757) (AE 7), and SOR subparagraph 1.e (owed in the amount\nof $4,517) (AE 6 & 10).  Applicant obtained the funds to satisfy these collection accounts\n2\nand the charged off account by borrowing funds from his 401k retirement plan. He is\nrepaying the loan from the 401k plan by having $79.76 automatically deducted from his\nwages each payday. (AE 14)\nApplicant has approximately $25,000 equity in his home. He attempted to obtain a\nhome equity loan to obtain the needed funds to satisfy his remaining delinquent creditors.\nHowever, his loan application was denied because of the existence of those creditors. (AE\n4 & 5) Shortly before the hearing, Applicant obtained counseling from a consumer credit\ncounseling service in an effort to obtain assistance from that company to satisfy his\nremaining creditors. Because he did not include his wife\u2019s income in the application, he\nwas about $350 per month short of the amount they required for him to obtain the\ncompany\u2019s assistance. He credibly testified he is going to reapply and include his wife\u2019s\nincome which will make him eligible for the program.       \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG]) 18\nApplicant incurred a number of delinquent debts when his attempt to start a\nbusiness with his brother failed. Those debts included delinquent taxes and accounts that\nwere either submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant accumulated reasonable savings and had his wife\u2019s income to rely upon\nwhen he decided to launch his business enterprise. Unfortunately for him, world events\nconspired to make his entrepreneurial undertaking a failure. Mitigating Condition (MC)\n20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\n\n5\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances apply.\nApplicant has now once again obtained secure employment and has taken\nmeaningful steps to satisfy his delinquent creditors. He has paid off four of the debts\nalleged in the SOR, including the federal tax debt, and has applied for assistance through\na consumer credit counseling service to resolve the remaining debts. Although three\ndelinquent debts remain outstanding, Applicant\u2019s actions in resolving the other debts and\nhis credible testimony as to what he will do to resolve those that remain permit application\nof MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC\n20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn January 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 5, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on April\n29, 2008.  A hearing was held on April 29, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether\nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or\nrevoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of\ntwo exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript\nAugust 11, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on May 7, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (a) used marijuana on at least 50\noccasions from 2000 to at least March 2007 and (b) purchased marijuana on at least 45\noccasions from January 2000 to at least March 2007.  For his answer to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted each of the allegations without explanation.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old consultant for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is unmarried and has no children.  He was introduced to marijuana in\nsocial settings in January 2000.  Before January 2000, he had never before used\nmarijuana or any illegal substances, never in high school and never in college (R.T.,at\n34-35).  Between January 2000 and March 2007, Applicant used marijuana occasionally\nwith friends in social settings. He estimates to have smoked the substance\napproximately 50 times between January 2000 and March 2007.  He had no established\npattern of use. \n For the most part, Applicant used marijuana when offered by a friend in a social\nsetting.  While he would customarily get together with friends once or twice a week, he\nhad no time table on when they would decide to use marijuana (R.T., at 37-38).  Albeit,\nhe occasionally used it when he was alone (R.T., at 38).  Most of his use was with in\ncigarette form, but occasionally he would use a pipe (R.T., at 38-39).  Because he did\nnot own a pipe himself, he borrowed one from others when he wished to use one.\nSometimes, he used rolling paper for his marijuana use (R.T., at 39).  Currently, he has\nneither a pipe nor rolling paper in his possession (R.T., at 39). \nApplicant has no clear explanation for why he used marijuana: It was just a social\nthing he liked doing.  He assures he never used marijuana at work (R.T., at 40) or  while\ndriving (see ex. 2; R.T., at 54).   He assures, too, that he never became addicted to the\nsubstance (R.T.,at 29).  Without any probative evidence to discredit these assurances,\nthey are entitled to acceptance. \nApplicant last underwent work-related drug screening for illegal drugs in 1990\n(R.T., at 40).  While in the Air Force (AF) (1988-1990), Applicant never held a clearance\nand never used marijuana.  At all times relevant, he was aware of AF policy against the\nuse of illegal drugs (R.T., at 42). \n\n3\nApplicant purchased marijuana approximately 45 times between January 2000\nand March 2007, all for his personal use, and not for resale.  He obtained his marijuana\nfrom friends, mostly in coffee houses.  Typically, his purchases involved 1/8 of an ounce\nof the substance for $50.00.  Sometimes, he would buy 1/4 of an ounce of the\nsubstance for $120.00 (R.T., at 46-47).  He assures he never sold or received anything\nelse from his sources besides marijuana (R.T., at 52).\nApplicant ceased using marijuana in March 2007 (possibly as early as January\n2007 according to his testimony) and has none of the substance left in his custody and\ncontrol (R.T.,a t 45-48).  He does not think it is wrong to use marijuana and believes its\nuse should be legalized like other intoxicating substances (R.T., at 48-49).  Still, he is\naware that marijuana use is against the law and acknowledges breaking the law when\nusing the substance.  \nApplicant has no intention of using marijuana in the future.  Since March 2007,\nhe has avoided parties where marijuana is used (R.T., at 50).  He has never been\ncounseled for drug use, and has never used any illegal drugs other than marijuana\n(R.T., at 52-53).  \nApplicant\u2018s facility clearance officer (FSO) is impressed with Applicant\u2019s technical\nskills and honesty (R.T., at 57-58).  She is aware of Applicant\u2019s past marijuana use.\nShe sees him weekly and notes that he has been free of drugs for over a year (R.T., at\n58-60); although, she has had little socialization with him on off-duty hours (R.T., at 60-\n61).  Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor (an owner of the company) is considers Applicant to\nbe honest and trustworthy (see ex. A; R.T., at 63-66).  He sees Applicant daily and is\nfamiliar with his past use of marijuana (R.T., at 67-69).  When he hired Applicant in April\n2007 he did not discuss drugs with him.  Not until he sponsored Applicant for a security\nclearance did he discuss illegal drugs with him,\nApplicant\u2019s other references characterize him as honest and trustworthy (see ex.\nA).  Coworkers who have worked closely with Applicant find him professional and\nconscientious in his handling of his assigned programs (ex. A).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n4\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: \u201cImproper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions\nregarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug\nabuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk\nof an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines,\n\u00b624.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious defense consultant with a considerable history of\nmarijuana involvement over a seven-year period. His use and purchases of the\nsubstance over a seven-year period spanning January 2000 through March 2007 is\nsecurity-significant.\nBy his own acknowledgments, Applicant began using marijuana as a mature adult\nwhen offered the substance in social situations.  While he views marijuana as no more\n\n5\nharmful than alcoholic beverages, he admits to being aware of its illegality while in the\nAF, and later as a civilian.  Between 2000 and 2007, he used marijuana at least 50 times\nin social settings and purchased the substance on almost as many occasions (at least 45\ntimes). \nApplicant's extended use and purchase of marijuana is sufficient to invoke two of\nthe disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs, i.e., DC 25(a) (any\ndrug abuse) and DC 25\u00a9) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia). \nApplicant has not used or purchased marijuana since March 2007 and assures he\nwill not use the substance in the future.  Based on Applicant\u2019s considerable history of\nmarijuana involvement, it is still too soon to enable him to claim the benefits of any of the\nmitigating conditions of the guideline for drug involvement.  Both his substantial\ninvolvement with marijuana and the relative recency of his involvement preclude him\nfrom taking advantage of MC 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d of the\nGuidelines.  His accepted year of abstinence and expressed intentions to avoid places in\nthe future where marijuana is used are very encouraging but still untested, and in need\nof additional seasoning to absorb all reasonable  risks of recurrence.  At this time, it is\nstill too soon to warrant application of any of the remaining mitigation conditions. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\nand hardworking professional consultant who used and purchased marijuana he knew\nviolated  the civilian laws of his state.  The positive impressions he has made on his\ncivilian employer must be balanced against the risks he poses to recurrent to marijuana\nuse based on his past involvement with the substance.  Neither his coworkers or\nsupervisors who know him pretty well socialize with him enough after hours to be able to\nmake safe predictions themselves about his risks of recurrence.  With only a year of\nabstinence to his credit and no counseling to guide him in the future, his positive work-\nrelated contributions are enough at this time to surmount risks of his returning to\nmarijuana use in the foreseeable future. \nConsidering all of the developed evidence of record, Applicant fails to mitigate\nsecurity concerns associated with his recurrent use and possession of illegal\nsubstances.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a and\n1.b of Guideline H. \nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached\nin the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the\nfactors listed above, I make the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE H (DRUGS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n6\nSub-paras. 1.a - 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLokey-Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on May 17, 2006. On February 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 11, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on April 10, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 17, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for June 3, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented six\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant presented two\nexhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.  The Applicant called one witness\nand testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until July 2, 2008, to allow\n\n2\nthe Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant submitted\ntwelve Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through\n12.  The Government had no objection to Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on June 13, 2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 25 years old and unmarried.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in\nMechanical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Mechanical\nEngineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe SOR alleges four debts totaling in excess of $65,000.00.  A debt to a creditor\nin the amount of $26,401.00, a debt to a creditor in the amount of $9,682.00, a debt to a\ncreditor in the amount of $9,345.00, and a debt to a creditor in the amount of\n$13,551.00.  Credit reports of the Applicant reflect that these debts have been owing\nsince 1998/1999.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5).  The Applicant denies each of the\ndebts and claims that he did not incur the debts but was the victim of identity theft and\ncredit card fraud.\nIn 1999, the Applicant\u2019s father started receiving threatening letters and telephone\ncalls from creditors concerning delinquent debts allegedly incurred by the Applicant and\nhis brother.  The Applicant was a minor and only fifteen years old at the time.  The\nApplicant\u2019s father contacted the creditor\u2019s fraud departments to report that the debts\nwere not the Applicant\u2019s or his brother\u2019s debts.  The Applicant\u2019s father suspected that\nthe individual who perpetrated the fraud was the Applicant\u2019s half-sister (his wife\u2019s\ndaughter from a previous marriage), who he helped raise since she was fifteen years of\nage, and/or her husband.  \nIn 1999, the Applicant\u2019s half-sister and her husband came to visit the Applicant\nand his parents and stayed at their home.  Following their visit, they abruptly moved\nfrom their out of state home to the state where the Applicant lived.  They purchased an\nexpensive home, cars, started several businesses, including a beauty shop and a\nrestaurant, and neither of them were employed during this period.  \nIn December 1999, the Applicant\u2019s father filed credit card fraud alerts for himself,\nhis wife, the Applicant, and his brother.  At that time, he was successful in having\n\n3\nseveral of the debts forgiven through the fraud departments by simply having the\nApplicant and his brother sign affidavits attesting to the fact that they did not incur the\ndebt.  The Applicant\u2019s father also contacted his state representative, who spoke to the\nOffice of the Attorney General and was advised that the only way at that time to proceed\nwas to prosecute the individual that they suspected had committed the fraud.  About this\ntime, the Applicant\u2019s half-sister and her husband abruptly moved out of state and left no\nforwarding address.  For two years, the Applicant had no knowledge of where they\nlived.  Presently, the Applicant\u2019s half-sister\u2019s husband is in prison for bank fraud.  In\nApril 2000, the Applicant\u2019s father suffered a brain aneurism and was unable to pursue\nthe matter any further at that time.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 10).\nIn 2002, the Applicant\u2019s father hired an attorney to assist his sons with their credit\nproblems.  After graduating from college, in August 2005, the Applicant moved out of\nstate and began working for his current employer. \nAn affidavit from Applicant\u2019s attorney, dated June 17, 2008, who is now a\nMagistrate, indicated that the Applicant was underage at the time that his half-sister\nand/or her husband committed identity theft and credit card fraud against the Applicant\u2019s\nfamily.  Any payments on the accounts that were made by the Applicant\u2019s father and\nmother were made in an effort to protect their daughter from criminal prosecution.  The\nattorney has been unable to provide useful assistance to the Applicant or his parents\ndue to the age of the debts and the fact that all collection efforts have ceased.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).  \nApplicant\u2019s performance reviews for the periods from October 2005 through\nOctober 2006, and January 2007 through January 2008, reflect that he either \u201cmeets\nexpectations\u201d or \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d in every category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit 12).     \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s half-sister dated June 12, 2008, indicates that she\nhas reason to believe that her husband committed the credit card fraud against her\nbrother, the Applicant.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).\nLetters of recommendation from professional associates of the Applicant attest to\nhis trustworthiness and responsible nature.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 11).\nCorrespondence from Transunion credit agency indicates that they have\ncompletely removed all delinquent accounts from the Applicant\u2019s credit report.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 8).  \nCorrespondence form Equifax credit agency indicates that they are still\nconducting their investigation of the circumstances.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit 6).\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individuals\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances; \n20.(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimate of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n5\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\n\n6\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant\u2019s poor financial history is not any fault of his own.\nHis four delinquent debts totaling in excess of $65,000.00  were caused by his half-\nsister and/or her husband who committed identity theft and credit card fraud against the\nApplicant.  The Applicant is working diligently to clear up this credit mess.  He\nunderstands the importance of paying his bills on time and living within his means.\nUnder the circumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness,\nand there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that\nhe can properly handle his financial affairs.  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(c) a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligation applies.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(a)\nthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individuals\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, 20.(b), the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and 20.(e)\nthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimate of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue also apply.     \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nThe Applicant was a fifteen year old minor when the delinquent debt listed in the\nSOR was incurred.  Based upon the evidence, he was the victim of identity theft and\ncredit card fraud before he was even old enough to apply for credit. With regard to the\ndebts he incurred himself, he has been responsible and has paid them in a timely basis.\nHe has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the eligibility\n\n7\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 for the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 10, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nMay 12, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer was received on February 4, 2008, and she requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on April 17, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 23, 2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nApplicant is unable to hear and unable to speak. Therefore, the hearing was\nconducted, without objections, with the aid of a certified interpreter for the deaf provided\nby Applicant\u2019s employer (Tr. 4\u20137; Appellate Exhibit I).  \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems as follows: (1)\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case filed in 1998 and discharged in 1999; (2) an unpaid\njudgment obtained in 2007 for $1,515; and (3) eight delinquent debts ranging from $487\nto $25,154 for about $36,000 in total. Her Answer was mixed. She admitted the\nbankruptcy, the unpaid judgment, and one of the delinquent debts, and she denied the\nother delinquent debts. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts\nare established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nthis company as a custodian since April 2007. She is seeking to obtain an industrial\nsecurity clearance for the first time. \nApplicant has been married since 1968. Her husband is retired and receives a\npension. Also, he receives social security disability due to several health problems.\nThey had one child, a daughter, who is now an adult. They do provide irregular financial\nsupport for their grandchildren. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented (Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and\n5). Starting with the Chapter 7 bankruptcy alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant and her\nhusband filed for bankruptcy protection in November 1998 (Exhibit 4). The summary of\nschedules lists total assets of $67,820 and total liabilities of $105,031. The Schedule F\nlists $42,302 in unsecured debt based on credit card accounts and signature loans. The\nbankruptcy court granted a discharge in March 1999. Applicant acknowledges the\n\n See Applicant\u2019s testimony at Tr. 28\u201335.\n3\n Department of Navy v.

She has not paid,\nsettled, or resolved any of the debts. She did not produce any documentation\nconcerning the debts at issue. The debts, as alleged in the SOR, are summarized in the\nfollowing table.3\nDebt Description\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013judgment for $1,515.\nUnpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013collection account for $501.\nAdmits it is her account; unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013charged-off account for\n$25,154.\nAdmits it is her account; unpaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013past-due account for $670.\nClaims she is making monthly payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013charged-off account for\n$1,065.\nAdmits it is her account; unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013charged-off account for\n$1,483.\nUnsure if it is her account. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013collection account for $2,960.\nAdmits it is her account; unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013charged-off account for $487.\nUnsure if it is her account. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013collection account for $3,755.\nUnsure if it is her account. \nApplicant has always been responsible for managing the family\u2019s financial affairs;\nindeed, her husband has never had credit. In addition to her husband\u2019s pension, she\nreceives a pension based on an early retirement from federal employment. She admits\nmaking mistakes and overextending with credit cards and loans (Tr. 35). Neither she\nnor her husband has any money in the bank (Tr. 46). She acknowledges that they live\npaycheck-to-paycheck or month-to-month (Tr. 46). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\n\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n19\n5\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n17\n18\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the post-bankruptcy\ndelinquent debts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nIt appears Applicant has lived beyond her means and has been financially irresponsible\nor lackadaisical. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none\napply.  Applicant has done little to demonstrate an intent to clean up her financial\n19\nhouse. Concerning the unpaid judgment and other debts, what is missing here is: (1) a\nrealistic and workable plan; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan;\nand (3) a measurable improvement to the situation. In simple terms, she did not present\nsufficient evidence to establish her case. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\n\n6\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. In particular, I gave due considerations to Applicant\u2019s disability, but\nthere does not appear to be a direct connection between her disability and her inability\nmanage her finances and pay her debts. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on March 12, 2007. On \nJanuary 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 17, 2008; answered it on \nFebruary 5, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on February 7, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on February 20, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2008, and an amended notice of hearing \non March 27, 2008, setting the hearing for April 23, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the \nrecord open until May 7, 2008, but he did not submit any additional evidence. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 1, 2008. The record closed on May 7, \n2008. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  I \nmake the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old explosives truck driver employed by a defense \ncontractor. He has two years of college but no degree (Tr. 7). He has worked for his \ncurrent employer for more than 30 years (Tr. 29). He has never been married and is not \nlegally responsible for supporting anyone but himself. He has never held a security \nclearance. \n \n \nIn the early 2000s, Applicant started accumulating delinquent credit card debt.  \nAs of the date of the SOR, he had 13 delinquent debts totaling more than $85,000. The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are the same debt, as are the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m. The duplicate debts are not included in the above totals. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he was injured on the job and \ndisabled for about six weeks. As a result of his injury, he could no longer work 50-55 \nhours per week, and the loss of overtime pay left him financially overextended (Tr. 37).  \nHe could not recall the date of his injury, but he remembered it was before he began \nworking as an explosives truck driver in April 2002 (Tr. 35). \n \n \nIn a personal financial statement submitted in response to DOHA interrogatories \non December 10, 2007, Applicant reported net monthly income of $2,084, monthly \nexpenses of $1,160, debt payments of $715, and a net remainder of $208 (GX 2at 5). At \nthe hearing, he testified his net monthly income was about $2,100, expenses were \nabout $1,530, and the remainder was about $500 minus the cost of gasoline for \ncommuting (Tr. 45-50). \n \n \nApplicant testified he thought the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a had been resolved \nwith an agreement to pay $160 per month (Tr. 38, 48-49). He had no documentation of \nthis resolution at the hearing and did not provide anything during the time allowed for \npost-hearing submissions. He has not made any payments on the other debts alleged in \nthe SOR. \n \n \nApplicant contacted a credit counseling agency at one time, but did not follow up \nafter the first interview (Tr. 52).  He does not have a budget or a specific plan to resolve \nhis financial situation, which he characterizes as a mess (Tr. 29, 53). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling more almost $89,000. The debts \nalleged in SOR 1.d and 1.l duplicate other debts alleged in the SOR. When the same \nconduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. \nBd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.l. in Applicant=s favor. The remaining 13 delinquent debts total more than \n$85,000. \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history \nof not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises these three disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). The first prong (\u201cso \n\n \n5 \n \n \nlong ago\u201d) is not established because his delinquent debts remain unresolved. The \nsecond prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established because his debts are so numerous. \nThe third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is not established because Applicant is financially \noverextended and has no plan to right his financial ship.  Finally, his financial history \nraises doubts about his good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s brief period \nof disability and his inability to work overtime were conditions beyond his control. \nHowever, he has done nothing to adjust his lifestyle to his income and virtually nothing \nto settle, compromise, or otherwise resolve his debts. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas not received counseling of any type, and his financial problems are not under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant testified he thought he had resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but he provided no \ndocumentation even after being given two weeks after the hearing to provide it.  He \nadmitted he had done nothing to resolve the remaining debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He presented himself as articulate and intelligent, but \nhe appears to be drifting through life. He has neglected his financial obligations for \nyears. He has no concrete plan for resolving his situation. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.k, and 1.m-1.o: Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR in December 2007. He answered the SOR in writing\non December 20, 2007 and requested a decision on the record. On July 31, 2008,\nApril 23, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\nResponse to SOR.\n2\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared and mailed an amended SOR, with four additional\nallegations under Guideline B (1.f through 1.i) and a new Guideline C, with two\nallegations (2.a and 2.b). Applicant received the Amended SOR on August 14, 2008\nand responded in writing on September 19, 2008. He requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge from DOHA. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nFebruary 12, 2008, and I received the case assignment on February 17, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on February 23, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on March 26, 2009. The government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one\nwitness testified on his behalf. He submitted nine exhibits (AE) A through I, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection.  The record closed on March 26,\n2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 9, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Iran. (Tr. 16-17) Applicant did not object to any of the\ndocuments submitted by Department Counsel. The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as\nAdministrative Exhibits I through XVII. The facts administratively noticed will be limited\nto matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The\nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answers to the SOR, dated November 30, 2007, and the amended SOR,\ndated July 31, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i of\nthe SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the\nSOR.

The policies in Iran in 1972 allowed\nApplicant to teach at the university for two years in lieu of military service, which is what\nApplicant did. He completed his teaching requirement in 1974.3\nApplicant emigrated from Iran to the United States (U.S.) in 1975 to attend\ngraduate school. Two years later, he graduated from a major U.S. university with a\nMaster of Science degree in mechanical engineering and a second degree in nuclear\nengineering. The Iranian government under the Shah provided him with a scholarship,\nwhich paid for the cost of his masters degree education. He returned to Iran in 1977 for\na few months. In December 1977, Applicant came back to the U.S. to begin work on his\nPh.D. at another major U.S. university. This university awarded him a scholarship,\nwhich paid much of the cost of his education. He also worked in a job similar to a\nteaching assistant in the nuclear engineering department. He received his Ph.D. in\nnuclear engineering and science in 1983.4\nUpon his graduation in 1983, Appellant began work in the nuclear industry. He\nworked for private companies in this industry until 1997. He did not hold a security\nclearance of any type during these years, although he had access to nuclear data. He\nhad no incidents which compromised this data. In 1997, after his son was born,\nApplicant switched his job focus. He began working for a federal government contractor.\nSince he began this employment, he has worked for two federal agencies. In 2000, he\nreturned to school part-time. In 2004, he received a masters degree in information\nsystems management from a major U.S. university. In his most recent contract position,\nthe federal agency investigated him and granted him an access certification, which is\nnot the same as a security clearance.5\nApplicant married his wife in Iran in 1978. She came with him to the U.S. and has\nlived with him in the U.S. since their marriage. They have three children, two daughters,\nages 28 and 22, and a son, age 12. His son is autistic. All three children are U.S.\ncitizens by birth. His wife does not work outside their home.6\nApplicant\u2019s 78-year-old mother and 86-year-old father are citizens and residents\nof Iran. His oldest sister is 62 years old, a widow with two grown children, a citizen of\nIran, and a resident of Iran. His younger sister is 53 years old, a citizen of Belgium, and\na resident of Belgium. His  wife\u2019s sister and one brother are citizens and residents of\nIran.  His wife has two brothers who live in the U.S. Applicant talks with his mother\n7\nabout once a month. He talks with his older sister and father less often and usually\n\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 12-15; Tr. 61-72.\n8\nTr. 62-72.\n9\nGE 1, supra note 3, 2-3; Tr. 58-59.\n10\nAdministrative Notice II (Iran Country Specific Information) at 1; GE 1, supra note 3, at 17-18; GE 2,\n11\nInterrogatory answers and attachments; Tr. 30-31, 59-60, 73-75, 83-85.\nTr. 73, 75-77.\n12\n4\nwhen he talks with his mother. He communicates with his family members in Iran by\ntelephone only. He occasionally talks with his sister in Belgium. Applicant has not\nspoken with his sister-in-law or brother-in-law for many years. His wife does talk with\nher sister, but not with her brother in Iran.8\nApplicant\u2019s father owned a stone business, but sold the business when he\nretired. He does not receive a pension from the Iranian government. His mother never\nworked outside their home. His older sister is a retired teacher, who lives with his\nmother. His mother is sickly and his older sister cares for her. He does not know the\nsource of his sister\u2019s income. His sister-in-law is married to a retired physician. His\nbrother-in-law in Iran retired from the Iranian Air Force at the rank of Colonel after 22\nyears of service.  \n9\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 1993. At that time, he held an Iranian\npassport. In 1996, he obtained his first U.S. passport, which he has renewed. His wife\nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2006.10\nIn December 2003, Applicant traveled to Iran for his grandfather\u2019s funeral, and in\nAugust 2006, he traveled to Iran for his grandmother\u2019s funeral. For both trips, he used\nhis Iranian passport to enter into and travel in Iran. The Iranian Section at the Pakistan\nEmbassy advised Applicant that he could not use his U.S. passport to enter into and\ntravel in Iran because as Iranian-born, Iran considers him only an Iranian citizen. Iran\ndoes not recognize his decision to renounce his Iranian citizenship and become a U.S.\ncitizen. Applicant considers the U.S. his home country, not Iran. His Iranian passport\nhas expired and he does not intend to renew it.11\nDuring his visits to Iran, Applicant visited with his parents and sister. His wife last\ntraveled to Iran seven or eight years ago. His daughters have been to Iran at least once.\nHe recently advised his parents that he would not be traveling to Iran in the future\nbecause he needs to spend his time with his son.12\nApplicant has never voted in an Iranian election, but he has voted in the U.S.\nPresidential elections since becoming a U.S. citizen. He does not own property or have\nbank accounts in Iran. His family in Iran does not know what type of work he does. To\nthe best of his knowledge, the Iranian government does not know about his educational\nand work background. He has never been approached by the Iranian government or an\n\nAE H; AE I; Id. 77-83, 87-88.\n13\nAE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. 29, 92-97.\n14\nAdministrative Notice I (U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Iran: March 2008).\n15\nAdministrative Notice IV (U.S. Department of State, Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2007).\n16\nId.\n17\nAdministrative Notice II, supra note 11, at 1.\n18\n5\nagent of the Iranian government. He owns several pieces of property in the U.S. His\nfinancial ties are with the U.S. As the only son, under Iranian law, he would inherit the\nmajority of his parents\u2019 property upon their death. To claim his inheritance, he must\ntravel to Iran. He does not plan to travel to Iran and asked his parents to make\narrangements for his older sister to inherit their property. He does not know what\nactions his parents have taken.13\nApplicant participates in his neighborhood homeowner association, coaches his\nson in soccer and works with Special Olympics. His oldest daughter testified on his\nbehalf. She attributes her strong academics to her father\u2019s support. He encouraged her\nand her sister to be well-rounded individuals. Two co-workers and one friend highly\nrecommend Applicant for a security clearance.14\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. In 1979, the Iranian Revolution\noccurred, which ended the rule of the Shah of Iran. In December 1979, Iranian rulers\nprepared a new constitution which defines the political, economic and social order of\nthis Islamic Republic. Iran is now an authoritarian, constitutional, theocratic republic,\ndominated by Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy.  Although human rights violations are prohibited by\n15\nlaw, the Iranian government does not enforce the law. Human rights violations continue,\nparticularly against journalists who speak out against Iran\u2019s current government,\nminority religions, such as the Baha\u2019i faith, and political activists, who oppose the\ncurrent ruling regime.  Serious mistreatment of prisoners occurs.  Because Iran does\n16\n17\nnot recognize dual citizenship, Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens are considered\nsolely Iranian citizens by the Iranian authorities, and are required to enter and exit Iran\non an Iranian passport. While traveling or residing in Iran, they are subject to\nsurveillance, search, harassment, arrest, and imprisonment. More recently, Iran has\nprevented a number of Iranian-American citizens from leaving Iran and in some cases\nhas charged individuals with espionage and being a threat to the regime.  \n18\nIran\u2019s government is hostile to the U.S. Current U.S. concerns about Iran are\nbased on its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction,\nsupport for and involvement in international terrorism, and support of violent opposition\nto the Middle East peace process. Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to\nShia political and militant groups in Iraq. It also provides encouragement, training,\nfunding, and weapons to anti-Israeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-\n\nAdministrative Notice V (Country Reports on Terrorism, April 30, 2008) at 1-2; Administrative Notice VI.\n19\nAdministrative Notices VII and VIII.\n20\nAdministrative Notice IX (National Intelligence Estimate Iran: Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities, November\n21\n2007); Administrative Notice X (Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence for the\nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, February 5, 2008).\n6\nIsraeli peace process, as well as advocating the destruction of Israel. The U.S. has\ndesignated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.  In 1979 in Executive Order 12170, the\n19\nPresident declared a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the\nInternational Emergency Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The national emergency\ncontinues.  The U.S. continues to have significant concerns about Iran\u2019s plans to\n20\ndevelop nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.21\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not\n22\nbe mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not in a position to be exploited.\nThe Appeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise\nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice between the\ninterest of the family member and the interest of the United States. (See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 (App. Bd,\nApr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205 (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)). Thus, an administrative judge was not\npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.\n8\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nApplicant, his wife and his children are all U.S. citizens and reside together in the\nfamily home in the U.S. Applicant does not claim Iranian citizenship and neither do his\nchildren. His wife became a U.S. citizen about three years ago. His relationships with\nhis wife and children are not a security concern. However, his elderly parents and older\nsister are citizens and residents of Iran. He talks by telephone with his mother monthly.\nHe talks less frequently with his father and sister. He visited his parents and sister when\nhe returned to Iran for his grandparents\u2019 funerals in 2003 and 2006. He does not talk\nwith his wife\u2019s sister or brother, but his wife does talk with her sister. Neither he nor his\nwife speak with her brother and have not for many years. He does not provide any\nfinancial support to his family members in Iran. His family relationships and his wife\u2019s\nfamily contacts are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance, but his\nand his wife\u2019s contacts with family members must be considered in deciding whether to\ngrant Applicant a clearance. The government must establish that these family\nrelationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion or would create a potential conflict of interest between his\nobligations to protect sensitive information and his desire to help his family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant and his wife\u2019s\nrelationship and contacts with family members as well as the activities of the\ngovernment of Iran and terrorists organizations receiving Iranian support. See ISCR\nCase No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an Applicant could be\ntargeted for manipulation or induced into compromising classified information is real, not\ntheoretical. Applicant\u2019s relationship and contacts with his parents and sister in Iran\nraises a heightened risk of security concerns because Iran supports and actively\nsponsors terrorism, especially against the U.S., continues to have a strong interest in\nobtaining nuclear weapons, and sometimes refuses to allow Iranian-Americans, who\nhave entered Iran for personal reasons, to leave. Iran has imprisoned some Iranian\nAmericans without good cause.\nUnder the new guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests.  Concerning Applicant and his wife\u2019s contacts with family members in Iran, I\n22\nhave considered that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, provides refuge for members\nof terrorist organizations, maintains stringent control over the lives of its citizens through\n\n9\nintense physical and electronic surveillance, denies its citizens basic freedoms enjoyed\nby U.S. citizens, and violates basic human rights. Iran is a hostile country, whose\ninterests are inimical to the U.S. The U.S. is a large democracy and Iran is a\nauthoritarian and theocratic government. Because Iran and the U.S. are adversaries,\nIran would act against U.S. interests if given an opportunity. While none of these\nconsiderations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered\nin determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because of his family\nmembers in Iran. His two recent trips to Iran and his contacts with his family members\nestablish that there is a heightened risk that Applicant will be targeted by Iranian\nauthorities or terrorists sponsored by Iran. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.\nIn deciding if Applicant has established mitigation, under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I must\nconsider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider whether Applicant has established:\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with his family members is not a basis to deny\nhim a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires more than\nstatements about the limited scope of his conversations with his parents and sister and\nno conversations with his wife\u2019s sister and brother. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App.\nBd. May 9, 2008). Applicant\u2019s parents and sister have never held a political position in\nIran. His parents\u2019 retirement income does not come from the Iranian government;\nhowever, it is unclear whether his sister\u2019s retirement income comes from the Iranian\ngovernment. Even though Iran is an authoritarian state and seeks to harm the U.S.,\nApplicant\u2019s family has not been targeted by the Iranian government. His family members\nhave never been arrested or imprisoned. The Iranian government has not made any\novert contacts with him when he visited his family in 2003 and 2006. His closest family\nmembers are residents of the U.S. Since he became a U.S. citizen in 1993, he has\nexercised the rights and privileges of citizenship. Balancing these factors against Iran\u2019s\nsupport of terrorism, poor human rights record, especially towards Iranian-Americans,\nits strong interest in nuclear weapons, and Applicant\u2019s expertise in nuclear engineering,\nwhile I believe Applicant would prefer to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests, I find that Iran\u2019s conduct towards Iranian-Americans and interest in nuclear\nweapons places Applicant in a very difficult position to resolve conflicting loyalties\n\n10\nshould Iran attempt to harm his parents and sister in Iran. Because of his and his wife\u2019s\nlack of contact with her brother, I find that Applicant would resolve any conflict involving\nhis wife\u2019s brother in favor of the U.S. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns as to SOR allegation 1.a, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and partially to 1.d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a)\nand 8(b). He has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns for the remaining\nallegations in SOR \u00b6 1.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 10, the following conditions could raise a security concern in this\ncase and may be disqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry.\nApplicant continued to retain his Iranian passport after he became a U.S. citizen\nin 1993. He used his passport to enter into and travel in Iran, his country of birth.\nAlthough the Iran government listed him as having the rank of Lieutenant in its military,\nApplicant never served in the Iranian military. His obtained an exemption because of his\noutstanding academic performance as an undergraduate student. The government has\nestablished a security concern under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).\nUnder AG \u00b6 11, the following conditions may mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns in this case:\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; and\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.\nApplicant does not claim Iranian citizenship, and he considers the United States\nhis homeland. Other than an Iranian passport, he has no benefits from the citizenship\nstatus conferred on him by Iran after becoming a U.S. citizen. He does not hold property\nor bank accounts in Iran nor has he voted in Iranian elections. Rather, he has exercised\nthe rights of U.S. citizenship. He owns property in the U.S. and votes in its elections. By\n\n11\nso doing, he has shown a preference for the U.S. Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport has\nexpired and he has not attempted to renew it. He told his parents that he does not\nintend to travel to Iran in the future. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline C.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant left\nIran nearly 34 years ago. He decided to remain in the U.S. and to become a U.S.\ncitizen. He owns property in the U.S. and votes in U.S. elections. He raised his family in\nthe U.S., and his wife and children are U.S. citizens. His actions reflects his strong ties\nto the U.S. \nThe evidence against granting a clearance is substantial. Applicant is highly\neducated and very intelligent. He worked in the nuclear industry for 14 years and has\ntwo degrees in nuclear engineering. His expertise in nuclear engineering, if known,\nwould be very valuable to Iran as Iran still has a strong interest in obtaining nuclear\nweapons. Iran\u2019s attitude towards the U.S., its strong desire to have nuclear weapons,\nand its treatment of Iranian-Americans raises serious concerns about  the actions Iran\nmight take to obtain classified information from Applicant. While I believe Applicant has\n\n12\nstrong ties to the U.S., I have a concern about the extent of pressure Iran may place on\nhim if he had access to classified information.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline C, but he has not\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns arising under Guideline B.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all 15 allegations in the SOR relating to approximately $30,000 in delinquent debts. He contends that all are the responsibility of his former wife. Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a government engineering contractor working as senior logistics analyst since April 2006. He works with flight simulators for high performance aircraft. He has held a security clearance for many years but it was suspended pending the outcome of this proceeding. His employer also does some unclassified work. He served on active duty with the Navy for 21 years and served aboard ship for 11 of those years as a fire control technician. He retired in 1999 as an E- 6. He receives retired pay from the Navy and a payment from the VA for a military disability. He was married for the third time in 1993 and separated in 2004.

On November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nF (Financial) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 12, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non December 31, 2007, and I received the case assignment on January 2, 2008. DOHA \nMarch 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nissued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008, for a hearing on January 31, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \nAt the hearing, the government offered five exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted twelve exhibits which were admitted \nwithout objection. He and one witness testified on his behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 13, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until March 3, 2008, to submit additional evidence. No additional \ninformation was submitted. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nNotice \nThe hearing notice was dated 15 days before the hearing date. I advised Applicant \nof his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant \naffirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated he was ready to proceed \n(Tr. 10).  \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all 15 allegations in the SOR relating \nto approximately $30,000 in delinquent debts. He contends that all are the responsibility \nof his former wife.  \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a government engineering contractor \nworking as senior logistics analyst since April 2006. He works with flight simulators for \nhigh performance aircraft. He has held a security clearance for many years but it was \nsuspended pending the outcome of this proceeding. His employer also does some \nunclassified work. He served on active duty with the Navy for 21 years and served \naboard ship for 11 of those years as a fire control technician. He retired in 1999 as an E-\n6.  He receives retired pay from the Navy and a payment from the VA for a military \ndisability. He was married for the third time in 1993 and separated in 2004. The \ndelinquent debts arose primarily between 1998 and 2002 when his wife was managing \nthe household accounts while he was traveling 70-80% of the time (Tr. 41). Two debts \nare from judgments filed in 2003 for credit card debts of over $4,339 (SOR \u00b6 1. a.) and \n$3,531 (SOR \u00b6 1. b.) (Exh. 5 and Tr. 45-46). Others are from credit cards used for \nhousehold and auto expenses, purchase of a boat, and a computer (Tr. 48-50). The \namounts range from $5,400 on a one credit card to $146 for a telephone bill. None have \nbeen paid.  \nWhen Applicant separated in 2004, he gave his wife some real property with the \nunderstanding that she was to pay the debts that had accumulated. A final judgment of \ndissolution of the marriage was obtained on July 16, 2007 (Exh. 2). A Marital Separation \nAgreement was referenced in the judgment but was not attached and did not provide for \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \na division of financial responsibilities (Tr. 61). The court retained jurisdiction to determine \nother matters such as allocation of financial responsibilities.  \nApplicant attempted to use arbitration in 2006 to resolve the financial issues but it \nhas not been successful. Applicant had difficulty with the arbitration process because of \ndelays and the expenses of his lawyer to find his wife in an effort to resolve the dispute \n(Tr. 23-26). \nApplicant is well regarded by his present employer and his two former employers \nsince 1999 for his skill, work ethic, and dedication (Exhs. G, J, K, and L, and Tr. 52-59). \nHe was given numerous awards and commendations for outstanding service while on \nactive duty with the Navy (Exhs. A\u2013F). He also has several excellent character \nreferences from people who know him well (Exhs. H, and I). He has one son from his \nsecond marriage who is 20 years old who lives with his mother. He is close to his father \nand visits him in the summer. \nApplicant is regarded as a good citizen in his community. He volunteers for civic \nactivities works with a boy scout troop to help scouts achieve eagle rank which he holds \n(Tr. 57).  He is also a skilled entertainer and performs whenever requested. He currently \nlives with a girlfriend and her ten year old son to whom he has an emotional bond.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is now stable and he is current on his expenses. \nHowever, the extensive delinquent debts at issue are still unpaid and he is responsible \nfor them. A division of responsibility decided by a court or some agreement reached with \nhis wife that she accepts responsibility for them would be helpful but does not end his \nresponsibility to repay the creditors. The creditors also would have to agree to release \nApplicant from responsibility for the debts, and this outcome does not automatically result \nfrom his wife\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for the debts.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant and his wife accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the \nSOR during their ten year marriage and Applicant has been unable or unwilling to pay the \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nobligations for several years. Thus, the evidence clearly raises these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Most of \nApplicant=s financial problems arose in the past ten years. He now has a well paying job. \nIt seems likely that he could resolve the debts over time even if he is unable to effectively \nresolve the issue of responsibility with his ex-wife. However, all of them, some with \nsignificant amounts and others with small amounts, remain unsatisfied. While he has \nexcellent references and the support of his employer, the delinquent debts raise security \nconcerns under the Guideline F. \nUnder AG & 20(b), the security concern may be mitigating where the conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control including \ndivorce or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThus, this condition is partially applicable because of the contribution the separation and \ndivorce had to his financial problems.   \nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is \na potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. While it not necessary for mitigation to apply that all of the \ndelinquent debts be resolved, it is necessary that a significant portion of this many debts \nbe in a payment plan, settled, or paid. Even this test has not been met. Not a single debt \nlisted in the SOR qualifies and he accepts no responsibility for any of them. Thus, I \nconclude that the mitigating conditions do not apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a superior record in the \nNavy and is highly regarded in his present employment. He acknowledges that the debts \nalleged in the SOR do exist insofar as he is aware, but believes his wife has responsibility \nfor them. No proof was offered to establish this contention. The efforts at arbitration failed \nand he has minimal contact with his former wife. He acknowledges that it may be difficult \nto get her to the table in any proceeding to resolve the dispute. Even if she accepts \nresponsibility for the debts, the creditor\u2019s concurrence with this arrangement would need \nto be obtained to relieve him of responsibility for the debts. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance at this time. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from these financial considerations and that it is premature at this time to grant a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:   Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  Against Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 21, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nMay 21, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer was received on February 1, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on April 18, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 28, 2008.\nThe record was kept open until May 9, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to\nsubmit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted post-hearing matters,\nwhich were forwarded by department counsel without objections. The post-hearing\nmatters are admitted as follows: Exhibit I\u2013fax cover sheet with five attachments; and\nExhibit J\u2013fax cover sheet with one attachment.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems as follows: (1)\nseven unpaid collection accounts in amounts ranging from $100 to $6,646 for a total of\nabout $12,377; and (2) a state tax debt with a balance of about $1,742. His Answer was\nmixed. He admitted owing the tax debt and five of the seven collection accounts, but he\ndisputed the amount owed for two collection accounts. Also, he provided an explanation\nfor each of the debts. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nthis company as a project administrator since about March 2007. He is seeking to\nobtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. He earned a B.A. in political\nscience in 2001. \nApplicant has married the same woman twice. They married in 2000, divorced in\n2004, and married again in 2005. They have two young children. His wife is a teacher\nfor a local school, and she was recently granted tenure. Their youngest child was born\nin early 2007 causing his wife to take leave without pay for about six months before\nreturning to full-time work in August 2007. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute (Exhibits\n2 and 3). He attributes his financial problems to three primary factors: (1) a business\nfailure (a restaurant) in 2001\u20132002, shortly after graduating from college; (2) an inability\nto find steady employment after the business failure; and (3) by not making debt\nrepayment a priority coupled with living on one income for about six months after the\nbirth of his second child (Exhibit 3\u2013Answer to Interrogatory 2). The business failure\n\n3\nresulted in delinquent credit cards, repossession of a car, termination of a cell phone,\nand three state tax liens due to unpaid sales tax from the business. The financial\nproblems were a significant factor in the divorce. \nThe matters alleged in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and\nthe admitted documentary evidence. The debts, as alleged in the SOR, are summarized\nin the following table.\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$100 collection account\nbased on a cell phone account. \nPaid (Exhibit B).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$6,646 collection account\nbased on a car repossession in 2003. \nIn settlement negotiations (Exhibit\nA\u2013Attachment 1; Exhibit I\u2013Attachment 3).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$3,055 collection account\nbased on a credit card account, which\nwas reduced to a consent judgment. \nIn payment plan with law firm; will\ncomplete in June 2008 (Exhibit 3; Exhibit\nA\u2013Attachment 2; Exhibit G).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$269 collection account\nbased on a credit card account.\nPaid (Exhibit 3; Exhibit A\u2013Attachment 3;\nExhibit I\u2013Attachment 5; Exhibit J).\nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$399 collection account\nbased on health club membership.\nCurrent balance is $335; intends to\npayoff with proceeds from 2008\neconomic stimulus payment of $1,200\n(Exhibit 3; Exhibit A\u2013Attachment 4;\nExhibit I\u2013Attachment 4; Tr. 88\u201390).\nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013$709 collection account based\non a former bank checking account. \nNo contact with creditor; intends to payoff\nby Dec. 2008 (Tr. 90\u201391; Exhibit E).\nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013$1,119 collection account\nbased on a credit card account.\nIntends to address in July 2008 once the\npayment plan in \u00b6 1.c is completed (Tr.\n91\u201393).\nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013$1,742 state tax debt based\non sales tax owed from failed business. \nPaid; total balance was at least $6,851 at\none time (Exhibit 2; Exhibit 3; Exhibit\nA\u2013Attachments 5 and 6; Exhibit C;\nExhibit I\u2013Attachment 1). \nAfter their second marriage in 2005, Applicant and his wife were able to finance\nthe purchase of a home and their mortgage is current.

Likewise, a coworker, who is a\ncomputer engineer employed by the government, believes Applicant is a professional,\nproficient employee with good potential (Tr. 42\u201349).  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The collection accounts and state tax debt are more\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Likewise, the same facts\nand circumstances support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n18\n6\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns.\n18\nThe six mitigating conditions are as follows: \nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,\nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nMC 2, MC 3, and MC 4 receive favorable consideration and are discussed below; the\nothers do not apply to the facts and circumstances here. \nMC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s control\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThe business failure, the divorce, the inability to find a steady job, and his wife\u2019s leave\nwithout pay were all factors in Applicant\u2019s financial problems and were all largely beyond\nhis control, especially the business failure. He has acted somewhat belatedly but still\nresponsibly under the circumstances by paying off the state tax debt generated by the\nbusiness failure.\nMC 3\u2014counseling for the problem\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. This MC applies\nbased on his recent enrollment in a church-based financial program designed to teach\npeople how to make the right decisions about their money. \nMC 4\u2014good-faith effort to repay\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. He presented\nsubstantial documentary evidence to demonstrate an intent to clean up his financial\nhouse. As summarized in the table above, he has paid two collection accounts as well\n\n7\nas the most security significant debt\u2014the state tax debt. He has a payment plan for one\naccount that should be completed next month. And he has realistic plans to address the\nother collection accounts in the near future. Taken together, these circumstances are\nsubstantial evidence of initiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. \nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, Applicant struggled financially after\nthe business failure and divorce. To their credit, he and his wife reconciled and\nremarried. They now have good jobs that produce regular income, as evidenced by their\nability to qualify for a home mortgage. He is making reasonable efforts to improve his\noverall financial condition, he is now exercising more financial responsibility (for\nexample, the monthly budget), and it is unlikely that he will experience similar financial\nproblems in the future. Although he did not present a perfect case in mitigation by\npaying off all the debts, he did present an adequate case in mitigation.  \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under sexual behavior (Guideline D), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and\npersonal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant provided his response to the SOR on April 15, 2009, and requested a\nhearing. On June 2, 2009, Applicant furnished notification of his intent to withdraw his\nrequest for a hearing because his employer did not provide an attorney to represent\nhim. I interpret his statements as a request for a decision be made on the record in lieu\nof a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the\ngovernment\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of the SOR) was sent to Applicant\non July 2, 2009. He received the FORM on July 10, 2009. His response to the FORM,\nwhich was received on August 4, 2009, includes Applicant\u2019s position statement and\neight character statements. The case file was assigned to me on August 19, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant submitted his answer (Item 4) to the SOR on April 15, 2009. He\nadmitted the sexual behavior allegation under paragraph 1, the two criminal conduct\nallegations under paragraph 2, and the personal conduct allegation under paragraph 3.\nNext, he essentially abandoned his admission to SOR 3.a. (personal conduct) by\nindicating he had not been told he had been charged with a felony in 1987, and should\nhave asked his military lawyer more questions. Then, Applicant indicated that with no\ncriminal record either in the Army or as a civilian, he was not knowledgeable about the\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or the criminal justice system. He knew that if\nthere was a problem during the security investigation, his military records would be\nchecked and he would be notified. Applicant stated, \u201cWhat I am trying to say is I was not\ntrying to hide anything because I knew my Military records would be checked[.] I would\nhave to be crazy to think my records would not be looked at.\u201d At a later point in his\nanswer to the SOR, Applicant stated:\nOnce again in hind sight if I thought that by answering \u201cNo\u201d to question\n22.a. on the (E-QUIP) investigation form would be taken as dishonest I\nwould have answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question. I was wrong[.] I just assumed\nthat i[f] there was any problem with my Military record[,] I would just be\ncontacted to explain. But I was not trying to hide anything.  \nApplicant is 52 years old and married with two daughters. He has been married\nsince July 1991. He also has two children from his first marriage which ended in June\n1990. Applicant served in the United States Army from October 1975 until his general\ndischarge under honorable conditions in December 1987. Before he was charged with\nthe sexual behavior in November 1986, he had been promoted to Sergeant First class,\nE7 pay grade. Applicant has been employed on the same civilian, defense contract as a\ncomputer programmer since 1988.\nSexual Behavior/Criminal Conduct\nOn November 22, 1986, Applicant was on active duty in the United States Army.\nHe had been drinking with friends for more than four hours before the sexual behavior\nwith his daughter, 12 years old at the time (Item 7). He recalled consuming a six-pack of\n\n3\nbeer and two or three glasses of wine. He considered himself under the influence of\nalcohol. He arrived home about two or three in the morning of November 23, 1986 (Id.) \nApplicant went to the bedroom of his 12-year-old daughter. He became sexually\naroused after kissing her on her cheek. He got in her bed, rolled her on her back, and\nengaged in oral sex for about five minutes (Id. at 2). He did not recall engaging in any\nother kind of sexual behavior with her. Then, he went to his room and fell asleep. \nThe next day Applicant was taken to the Criminal Investigative Division (CID) and\ncharged with attempted rape and sodomy. In explaining the circumstances of the\ncharge, Applicant stated, \u201cI had a charge read to me by the CID, and the major\npresented written papers to me, but those were the only written charges regarding the\nmatter.\u201d (Id. at 5) Although Applicant did not recall committing any additional sexual acts\non his daughter, he was sure he did not commit sodomy (Id. at 2). The agent\ninterviewing Applicant indicated that he would not put handcuffs on Applicant but\nwarned him against an escape attempt (Id. at 2). \nApplicant accompanied the CID agent to the base hospital. He assumed the\npurpose of the trip was to complete evidence of a rape kit sample (Id. at 2). Applicant\nrecalled a doctor removed some pubic hair from his body. He told the doctor he felt like\nkilling himself. Then, he was transferred to the psychiatric unit of the hospital where he\nstayed for the next two months (Id. at 3). He recalled participating in group counseling\nsessions, but no individual therapy (Id.). Finally, while in the hospital, Applicant\u2019s military\nattorney told him not to talk with the person conducting the sexual offender class.\nApplicant did not enroll in a sexual offender program. When the two months ended,\nApplicant was released and returned to his unit. He recalled apologizing to his former\nwife and the victim on several occasions over the next few years (Id. at 4). \nOn July 1, 1987, a Memorandum for the Director, US Army Crime Record Center\n(Item 9), was filed by a special agent of the CID. The Memorandum chronicled details of\nthe investigation. Witnesses, including the victim, were interviewed. During an\ninvestigation of the crime scene, Applicant\u2019s note of apology to the victim was\ndiscovered. The medical official found no signs of physical injuries, trauma, or sperm on\nthe victim. Finally, various officials in Applicant\u2019s command agreed that he be charged\nwith attempted rape (Article 80, UCMJ), indecent acts with a child (Article 134, UCMJ),\nand sodomy (Article 125, UCMJ). \nFrom the beginning of his hospitalization until October 1987, Applicant indicated\nhe was never approached about the case. At an undisclosed time in 1987, Applicant\nattended drug and alcohol awareness classes for six months (Id. at 4). \nAt the end of October 1987, Applicant was called to the office of the Judge\nAdvocate General (JAG), and told by his military attorney that because he was an\nexcellent Sergeant, he would receive a general discharge under honorable conditions,\nan option recommended over the other option of going to court. Applicant recalled\n\n4\nsigning the paperwork accepting the conditions of his discharge. He was discharged\nfrom the Army in December 2007 (Item 10).\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant submitted a Questionnaires for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) on\nAugust 22, 2006. In response to question 23.a. (Have you ever been charged or\nconvicted of any felony offense (include those under the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice)?, Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In his answer to the SOR 3.a., he answered \u201cI\nadmit,\u201d acknowledging he deliberately failed to disclose he had been charged with\nfelony offenses under the UCMJ. \nHowever, at a subsequent location in his answer explaining the reasons for his\nresponses to the SOR, Applicant immediately provided other explanations for his \u201cNo\u201d\nresponse to question 23.a. (SOR 3.a.) He claimed he misunderstood question 23.a. The\nonly information provided by his military attorney in 1987 was that he would receive a\nchapter discharge. Applicant was not knowledgeable about the corresponding status of\ncriminal cases under the UCMJ, and he knew he did not have a felony in his civilian life.\nThen, Applicant stressed that he was not trying to hide anything because he knew his\nmilitary records would be looked at, and he would be crazy to think his military records\nwould not be reviewed. Applicant would have answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question had he\nthought the \u201cNo\u201d answer would be interpreted as dishonest. He ended his sworn\nstatement (Item 7) with the following statement:\nI did not claim this activity on my case papers (e-QIP) because I never\nwent to jail, I was never officially charged with this matter, and the way the\nquestions were asked, none of the events, I thought, fit the questions. I\nnever intended to hide this activity, I just did not know how to record it or\nmention it on my case papers.\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant also stated that if his DD Form 214,\nwhich states that his discharge occurred \u201cfor commission of a serious offense, had said\n\u201cfelony,\u201d then he would have answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 23.a. (response to FORM,\nposition statement; Item 10 at 3). Had Applicant seen Item 8 and/or Item 9 of the\nFORM, he would have answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 23.a. of his e-QIP (response to\nFORM, position statement). I am unable to accept Applicant\u2019s alternative rationales for\ndeliberately providing false information on the e-QIP in August 2006. \nCharacter Evidence\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided eight character references from\nhis family, friends, and coworkers. Applicant\u2019s current wife considers Applicant to be\nhonest. Applicant told his wife about the sexual behavior with his daughter from his first\nmarriage. One of two daughters of Applicant\u2019s current wife insisted that he accompany\nher down the aisle in her wedding. Applicant has always been supportive of his current\nwife\u2019s two daughters and their children. \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s 35-year-old daughter from his first marriage, furnished a statement\nindicating she forgives Applicant for his sexual behavior committed against her in\nNovember 1986. Applicant has always been supportive of her and her three daughters.\nHe calls her weekly and sends cards indicating he is thinking about her family. \nThe senior pastor of Applicant\u2019s church has known Applicant since 1990, and has\nfound him to be dependable and trustworthy. Applicant\u2019s friend of 21 years believes\nApplicant is dedicated and trustworthy, and a very responsible foster parent in providing\na wholesome living environment for two foster children. Applicant\u2019s coworker of 14\nyears considers Applicant to be knowledgeable. Two fellow church members have\nknown Applicant since 1990. They consider him a problem solver and very involved in\nthe objectives of the church (response to FORM).\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor has known Applicant since 1995. He recommends\nApplicant for a position of trust based on his honesty and habit of getting the job done\nas planned (Id.). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the variables listed in the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\n\n6\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nSexual Behavior\n\u00b6 12. The Concern. \u201cSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be\nraised on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s sexual misconduct constitutes criminal sexual behavior within the\nscope of sexual behavior (SB) disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 13.a. (sexual behavior of a\ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted). The investigative\nreports, supported by Applicant\u2019s admission, establish that he engaged in unlawful\nbehavior with his daughter who was 12 years old in November 1986. Applicant\u2019s\nmisconduct is also disqualifying under SB DC \u00b6 13.d. (sexual behavior of a public nature\nand/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment) because of the poor judgment\nApplicant exhibited to satisfy his sexual desires. The fact that he was under the\ninfluence of alcohol is not mitigating.\nHowever, after a careful review of the record and SB MC \u00b6 14.b. (the sexual\nbehavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances,\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment), I conclude Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior is mitigated.\nThe sexual act(s) occurred more than 22 years ago. Applicant\u2019s two-month period of\nhospitalization in late 1986 and early 1987 (where he received group counseling), and\nthe absence of any indication he has repeated this conduct since November 1986,\nweighs in his favor. He has a stable and supportive relationship with his former wife\u2019s\nfamily, particularly the victim. He has a close relationship with his current wife\u2019s family,\nincluding her daughters and granddaughters. This favorable character evidence results\nin a finding for Applicant under the sexual behavior guideline. \n\n7\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\n\u00b6 30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nCriminal conduct CC disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 31.a. (a single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses) and CC DC \u00b6 31.c. (allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted) apply in this case. Under SOR 2.a. Applicant was charged with criminal\nviolations of Articles 80 (attempt to commit rape), 134 (indecent acts with a child), and\n125 (sodomy). He avoided criminal prosecution under those UCMJ Articles by accepting\na discharge under honorable conditions. By engaging in illegal sexual misconduct with\nhis 12-year- old child, Applicant breeched the most important duty that all parents owe\nto their children which is the duty to care and protect them. \nCC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31.a. and 31.c. apply to Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his e-QIP\nin August 2006. His falsification was material in that he was trying to conceal relevant\ninformation the government has a legitimate right to know about in making a security\nclearance determination. \nTwo of the five mitigating conditions (MC) under personal conduct apply to\nmitigate SOR 2.a. of the SOR. CC MC 32.a. (so much time has passed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) clearly applies to the circumstances of this case as Applicant\u2019s criminal\nsexual misconduct occurred more than 22 years ago. There is no evidence to infer or\nsuggest the criminal sexual behavior has occurred since then, or that it could surface in\nthe future.\nCC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity development) provides substantial mitigation. In addition to the passage of\ntime without the recurrence of criminal activity, Applicant has convinced me he is truly\nremorseful for his misconduct. He has established a stable lifestyle with his current wife,\nher children, and his grandchildren. He enjoys strong ties with the victim and her\nchildren. SOR 2.a. is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR 2.b. has not been mitigated. The intentional falsification occurred\napproximately three years ago. Applicant continues to deny his falsification was\ndeliberate. The favorable character evidence from his family, his coworkers and his\nchurch, does not mitigate his continuing denial that he falsified the e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s\ndenial he falsified his e-QIP establishes a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Accordingly,\nSOR 2.b. and the CC guideline is resolved against Applicant. \n\n8\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b6 15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThis guideline applies to intentional attempts to conceal or omit information\nduring the course of a security investigation. PC DC \u00b6 16.a. (deliberate omission or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire to determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness) applies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nfalsification of his e-QIP in August 2006. In not disclosing his sexual misconduct in the\nsecurity form, Applicant concealed material information the government has a right to\nknow about to make an informed security clearance determination. His deliberate\nconcealment of information is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \nThough Applicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he falsified his e-QIP in\nAugust \n2006, \nhe \nimmediately \ndisowned \nhis \nanswer \nwith \na \nplethora \nof\nexplanations/rationalizations for his \u201cNo\u201d answer. In the face of his claim of supposedly\nnot knowing he was charged with felonies, he stated that on the day of the offense, a\ncharge was read to him at the CID office because he recalled hearing sodomy and\nattempted rape. \nApplicant also claimed that if his DD Form 214 had contained the word \u201cfelony\u201d\nas the reason for his discharge, or if he had been aware of Item 8 and/or Item 9 before\nanswering the e-QIP in August 2006, he would have answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 23.a. I\ndo not accept this claim because I believe Applicant had enough information available in\nAugust 2006 to answer question 23.a. correctly. The fact that he chose to terminate his\nmilitary career to avoid being prosecuted under the UCMJ should have been one of the\ncompelling reasons for him to disclose rather than conceal the missing information.\nApplicant repeatedly claimed that if there was problem during the security\ninvestigation with the information provided, he would be notified, and that he would\n\u201ccrazy\u201d to believe there would not be a follow-up investigation. Applicant\u2019s subjective\nbeliefs about the security investigation are misplaced. An applicant must be candid and\nforthright during all phases of the investigation. Every applicant has a duty to furnish\ntruthful answers to all questions on a security form. Applicant did not, yet he certified\nwith his signature at the end of his e-QIP that the information was accurate and supplied\nin good faith. Even if I were to accept Applicant\u2019s confusion about where to supply the\ninformation in his e-QIP (which I do not), he could have proceeded to the \u201cAdditional\nComments\u201d space of his e-QIP, just before the certification section, and disclosed the\nmissing information. He declined. \n\n9\nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC \u00b6 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC \u00b6 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC \u00b6 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). I conclude that the mitigators do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have examined the evidence utilizing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nof the SB, CC, and PC guidelines. I have resolved the SB guideline for Applicant, and\nthe CC and PC guidelines against Applicant. The case still must be weighed within the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was 29 years old when he committed the criminal sexual behavior\nagainst his daughter who was 12 years old in November 1986. The passage of more\nthan 22 years without recurrence of conduct of a similar nature warrants a finding for\nApplicant under the SB guideline. \nBut, Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his August 2006, security form has not\nbeen mitigated by the positive family and job evidence. Against his original admission to\nSOR 3.a., the abundance of follow-up explanations denying his falsification was\nintentional undermines Applicant\u2019s credibility while reinforcing my ultimate findings\nagainst Applicant under the CC and PC guidelines. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Sexual Behavior, Guideline D):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR with explanation. Applicant is a 60-year-old program manager for a defense contractor. He was born in Taiwan and received his early education, including his bachelor's degree in mathematics, in Taiwan. He completed his compulsory military service required by Taiwan of its male citizens as a second lieutenant but did not hold a security clearance. After college, he worked for a Taiwan bank for a year before coming to the United States in 1975 at age 27 to further his education. He received a master's degree in mathematics in 1976 from a United States university. He attended another United States university where he received both a master's degree and a doctorate in operations research in 1979. He then taught in the field of Information Systems at another United States university for three years. He was accepted for a position in software development at a nationally recognized research and development laboratory in 1983. He worked for the laboratory for the next 22 years and retired in 2004 as the Program Director for business services for the laboratory.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Edward J. Tolchin, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP) on October 7, 2005.  On June 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nApplicant under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 16, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on June 17, 2008, admitting all factual allegations in the SOR, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department counsel was prepared \nto proceed on July 31, 2008, and I was assigned the case on August 4, 2008.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 3, 2008.  The government offered four exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibit (Gov. Ex.) 1-4, which were received without objection.  Applicant \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted 51 Applicant Exhibits, marked App. Ex.s A through YY, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 12, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request for administrative notice of \ncertain facts relating to Taiwan. (Tr. 14)  The request and the supporting documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  \nApplicant had no objection to the request for administrative notice and the attached \ndocuments.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation.   \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old program manager for a defense contractor.  He was \nborn in Taiwan and received his early education, including his bachelor's degree in \nmathematics, in Taiwan.  He completed his compulsory military service required by \nTaiwan of its male citizens as a second lieutenant but did not hold a security clearance.  \nAfter college, he worked for a Taiwan bank for a year before coming to the United \nStates in 1975 at age 27 to further his education.  He received a master's degree in \nmathematics in 1976 from a United States university.  He attended another United \nStates university where he received both a master's degree and a doctorate in \noperations research in 1979.  He then taught in the field of Information Systems at \nanother United States university for three years.  \n \nHe was accepted for a position in software development at a nationally \nrecognized research and development laboratory in 1983.  He worked for the laboratory \nfor the next 22 years and retired in 2004 as the Program Director for business services \nfor the laboratory.  He did spend one year during this time working for a prominent \nUnited States airline as their director of operations research.  His family did not move so \nApplicant only took this position for one year (Tr. 23-31, 80-81; Gov. Ex. 2, \nInterrogatories, dated November 24, 2007; App. Ex. YY, Resume, undated). \n \nHe is now employed as a program manager for a company that has government \ncontracts.  He has worked on various government projects for the company.  He is now \nthe program manager for a contract working on computer projects for a major military \nhospital which requires a security clearance.  He previously served as the program \ndirector and United States representative on a project for the contractor for the United \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStates Navy providing training services to Taiwan which did not require a security \nclearance (Tr. 32-33, 83-84). \n \nApplicant has received many awards for his work with the laboratory, including \nthe highest award in the field of operations research (Tr. 35-41; App. Exs. A-C and WW, \nlist of awards and citations, various dates).  Applicant contributed in many innovations \nand projects with the laboratory (Tr. 34-38; App. Exs. D-I, K-N, yearly accomplishments \nand ratings, various dates).  His work for his present government contractor employer \nhas also been exceptional (App. Ex. J, Rating, undated).   \n \nApplicant's wife was also born in Taiwan and is 56 years old.  They were married \nin the United States in 1977 and both became United States citizens in 1987.  They \nhave lived in the same house near the location of the laboratory since 1984.  His wife \nhas been employed as a computer programmer at the same laboratory for over 23 \nyears.  They do not discuss their work with each other.  Applicant's wife still has a \ncurrent Taiwanese passport.  Applicant does not know if she is considered a dual citizen \nof Taiwan or why she still has her Taiwanese passport.  They have three children who \nare all citizens and residents of the United States.  Two have left the house and are \nworking and the third is a college student.  Applicant was the first Chinese-American to \nrun for a local public office and served seven years on his community's school board.  \nDuring his tenure on the school board, he twice served at the request of his town's \nmayor as the host of delegations from the People's Republic of China looking at local \ngovernment management.  He ran for a seat on the local governing council but was not \nelected.  He has limited contact with former classmates or friends in Taiwan (Tr. 33-35, \n47-50, 83-85, 88-89; Gov. Ex. 1, E-QIP, dated October 7, 2005). \n \nApplicant has extensive funds and holdings in the United States.  He also owns \nhis home and two rental properties and has no debt.  His investments and properties \nhave a net worth of about $5.4 million.  He pays taxes which are current and draws \nsocial security each month (Tr. 62-72; App Exs. O-II, Statements of investments, \nvarious dates; App. Exs. JJ-LL, Property taxes on house and rental property, various \ndates; App Exs, MM-PP, Social Security payments, various dates). \n \nApplicant also has financial holdings and real estate in Taiwan.  In 1982 when his \nbrother-in-law in Taiwan started a software development company, he was asked to \ninvest in the company.  He did invest and the funds were held by a brokerage company \nin Taiwan.  He left the funds with the brokerage company and the investment is now \nworth about $650,000.  He does not control the funds and permits the brokerage \ncompany to manage the assets.  The brokerage company has the funds in stock in \ncompanies that are publicly traded in Taiwan.  Some of the companies are also traded \nin the United States.  He does pay taxes to Taiwan as required by law on the \ninvestments (Tr. 52-57; Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated November 24, 2007; Gov. Ex. \n3, Interrogatories, undated; App. Exs. RR-UU, Brokerage firm statements, various \ndates).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant's father purchased a piece of farm land in June 1973 for approximately \n$50,000 with five other investors.  Since Applicant was his first born son, the father's \nshare of the property was placed in his name.  Applicant did not know of the property or \nhis ownership rights until recently.  The government at some time divided the property in \nhalf by using part for a highway right of way.  The value of the property is now $10,000 \nand Applicant owns 23% of that value.  He has not sold his share because it would \nrequire the concurrence of the other investors or their successors.  He does not pay \ntaxes on the property and he does not know if his mother pays taxes on the property \n(Tr. 57-61, 71-72, 87-88; Gov. Ex. 3, Interrogatories, undated; Applicant Exhibits VV-\nWW, land contract, undated). \n \nApplicant visited Taiwan in 2001 for his mother's 80th birthday celebration. He \ntraveled to Taiwan in 2004 because of a special deal offered by the Taiwanese airline.  \nAs part of the arrangement, he was required to obtain a Taiwanese passport and vote in \nthe Taiwan elections that year.  He traveled on the Taiwanese passport and voted in the \nTaiwanese presidential election.  On return to the United States, he relinquished his \nTaiwanese passport to the Taiwanese consulate in the United States.  He also traveled \nto Taiwan four times in 2005-2006 and twice in 2007 as part of his duties with his \nemployer to provide training support to Taiwan using his United States passport.  Other \nthan his contacts with Taiwanese officials when working as the United States \ngovernment representative on the Navy training support contract, he had no contact \nwith Taiwanese government officials.  He does have some limited contact with former \nfriends from Taiwan (Tr. 50-52, 82-83; See, Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated \nNovember 24, 2007, at 5; Gov. Ex. 4, Testimony, dated January 4, 2007).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a resident and citizen of Taiwan living with Applicant's \nbrother and his wife in an apartment owned by his mother.  She is 89 years old and has \nbeen retired for over 30 years from her employment at the Taiwan national bank.  His \nfather served in a government capacity in a position similar to a Senator for over 49 \nyears before he died over 20 years ago.  His mother draws a pension from her own \nemployment with the bank and from her husband's work as a government employee.  \nShe also has health coverage through the national health plan.  His mother has visited \nhim in the United States but returned to Taiwan because of difficulties with culture and \nlanguage in the United States.  He talks to her almost weekly and they have a strong \nloving relationship.  Their conversations are fun loving like he was still her young son.  \nHe does not provide her any support and does not send her gifts since she is self \nsustaining with the pension payments she receives (Tr. 42-44, 74-78)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother was educated in the United States and received a doctorate \nin civil engineering from a United States university.  He returned to Taiwan and retired \nas the president of the software development company founded by Applicant's sister's \nhusband.  He talks to his brother approximately once a month during one of his \nconversations with his mother (Tr. 44-45, 78-79; Gov. Ex. 4, Testimonies, dated \nJanuary 4, 2007). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s sisters is a housewife married to the brother-in-law that \nfounded the software development company.  She has not been employed but is a \npainter.  Applicant does have telephone contact with his sister (Tr. 45-47).  Applicant \nhas another sister in Taiwan who retired about ten years ago after working for the \nUnited States Consulate in Taiwan.  He husband is a professor at a Taiwan university \nwho will retire soon.  Applicant also has periodic telephone contact with her.  Applicant \nalso has a sister who has been a resident and citizen of the United States for over 30 \nyears (Tr. 46-47, 80-81; Gov. Ex. 4, Testimony, dated January 4, 2007).   \n \nApplicant's wife's family is mostly in the United States.  Her mother and two \nbrothers are citizens and residents of the United States.  She has one brother in Taiwan \nwho is an engineer involved in research.  Applicant's wife speaks to her brother in \nTaiwan periodically when she updates him on the condition of their mother.  Applicant \nspeaks to this brother-in-law about once a year (Tr. 48-49. 90-91). \n \n \nDuring World War II and after, a civil war was fought on the mainland of China \nbetween the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalist Chinese.  In 1949, the \nChinese Communist Party was victorious and established a government on the \nmainland.  The Nationalist Chinese fled to the island that is now Taiwan and established \na government.  Taiwan has developed steadily since then and is now the world\u2019s 17th \nlargest economy.  Taiwan became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2002, \nfurther expanding its trade opportunities and further strengthening its standing in the \nglobal economy.  This prosperity established economic and social stability.   \n \n \nUntil 1986, Taiwan's political system was effectively controlled by one party, the \nKuomintang.  Since ending martial law in 1987, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to \nimprove respect for human rights and create a democratic political system. The United \nStates has been committed to maintaining cultural, commercial, and other nonofficial \nrelations with Taiwan since January 1979, when it formally recognized the government \nof the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China.  By \nformal act of Congress (Taiwan Relations Act of 1979), the United States is committed \nto provide Taiwan with military defensive arms in support of Taiwan's security and \nstability in the region.  The United States also stated it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.  Despite the United \nStates clear and consistent position that Taiwan and the mainland are part of one \nChina, United States commercial ties have expanded with Taiwan and the United States \nis supportive of Taiwan's membership in international organizations, such as the World \nTrade Organization and the Asian Development Bank (See Hearing Exhibits, United \nStates, Department of State's Background Note: Taiwan, dated March 2008).   \n \nWhile still pursuing a closer relationship with Taiwan, the official United States \nposition on Taiwan and mainland China seems to be a criticism of mainland China\u2019s \nbuildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings to the effect that United \nStates support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  Smooth United States \nand PRC relations are an important tool in cooperating against terrorism and \nmaintaining stability in the Pacific region.  Faced with competing pressures and the \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncontinuing transformation on both the PRC and Taiwan systems, the United States \ngovernment may be facing new and more difficult policy choices in the future (See \nHearing Exhibits, Congressional Research Service Report to Congress: Taiwan: Recent \nDevelopments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated December 14, 2007). \n \n \nThe government claims through Administrative Notice that Taiwan poses a threat \nto national security because, in the past, it was one of the countries most actively \nengaged in industrial espionage and the collection of foreign economic information. The \nrequest cites to the Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and \nIndustrial Espionage of 2000.  This report lists Taiwan as one of the most active \ncollectors of industrial and economic intelligence.  However, the government also \nattached to its request the more recent Annual report from 2005 which was dated \nAugust 2006.  The report does not list Taiwan as being one of the biggest collectors of \neconomic and industrial espionage.  It does list the PRC and Russia as the most active \ncollectors.  The report states the United States is targeted by a large number of foreign \ncountries for economic and industrial espionage.  The report notes that the foreign \nprivate sector is the most active collector of this type of economic and industrial \nintelligence, but there is ample evidence that foreign intelligence services and other \ngovernment organizations remain aggressive in collecting information by using the \nprivate sector to collect information for them and by their own continued direct \nintelligence gathering operations.   \n \nThe report list a number of factors that could cause concern for the United \nStates.  Among the concerns are the number of foreign visitors from any country to \nUnited States sensitive sites, the number of non-immigrant persons from a country that \nare admitted as visitors to the United States, and the number of requests from a country \nfor visits to military and defense industry sites.  There are a large number of visitors \nfrom Taiwan to the United States for business, pleasure, or other purposes.  But Taiwan \ndoes not send a large number in comparison to other countries of visits to selected \nnuclear sensitive facilities in the United States.  By comparison, the number of request \nfor visits to military and defense industry sites by Taiwan jumped ten fold from Fiscal \nYear 2004 to Fiscal Year 2005.  Taiwan does not appear to be any more active in the \ncollection of economic and industrial intelligence than many other allied counties. \n \nThe government also presented information concerning individuals in the United \nStates convicted of engaging in espionage practices on behalf of Taiwanese companies \nor officials, as well as companies that violate export control requirements in sending \nitems to Taiwan.  Some of these cases involve individuals in the United States, both \nnative born and foreign born and both citizens and non-citizens of the United States, \nthat formed friendships with Taiwan Intelligence agents and then provided the agents \nwith classified information.  While the government presented information only on Taiwan \ncases, it is not difficult to assume that there are cases that pertain to other countries as \nwell.  In a case in which a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employee provided \nclassified information to Taiwan, Applicant presented information showing that Taiwan \ndid not solicit information from the individual.  In fact, the FBI stated that Taiwan was \ncooperating with it on the investigation (App. Ex. XX, Article, dated August 28, 2008).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe fact that there are cases of Taiwan intelligence agents accepting intelligence \ninformation from sources in the United States, no matter how obtained, does raise \nsecurity concerns. \nThe government argues that the geographical closeness of Taiwan and the PRC \ncauses Taiwan to engage in industrial, military, and economic espionage to ensure that \nthey are strong enough to counter threats from the PRC.  It is correct that the closeness \nof the PRC causes Taiwan concern.  However, that threat is counter balanced by the \nneed of Taiwan to continue friendly relations with the United States as one of its prime \nprotectors and sources of military equipment. The relationship between the United \nStates and Taiwan is defined in the Taiwan Relations Act which recognizes Taiwan. \n(Public Law 96-8)  Taiwan has a long history of friendly relations with the United States, \nincluding substantial levels of foreign trade.  Taiwan is an ally and friend but also poses \na security threat because of its activities and efforts to obtain economic, industrial, and \nnational security information.  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity \nof the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding but not limited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known \nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant has foreign contact through his mother, brother, two sisters, and \nbrother-in-law, who are all citizens and residents of Taiwan.  These contacts raise \nsecurity concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7(a) \n(Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to a foreign person, group, government, \nor country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information).  Each individual contact by \nitself may not create a risk of foreign influence, but the totality of the contacts may \nindicate a risk of foreign influence.  Applicant's substantial stock holdings in a \nTaiwanese brokerage company and his interest in a piece of land inherited from his \nfather raises security concerns under FI DC AG \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, \nor property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risks of foreign influence or \nexploitation).   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant resides with his wife in the United States.  Both have been United \nStates citizens for over 21 years.  However, Applicant's wife has a brother that is a \ncitizen and resident of Taiwan which raises FI DC AG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters with \na person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).   \n \n \nThe government has established that there is a heightened risk of a security \nconcerns because Taiwan does engage in economic and industrial espionage, even \nthough there is no evidence that Taiwan targets United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information.  Taiwan and its intelligence agents did receive protected \ninformation from persons in the United States but in these cases the information was \noffered to the agents by the United States citizens rather than Taiwan targeting the \nUnited States citizens by exploiting, manipulating,  pressuring, on coercing United State \ncitizens for protected information.  The government has not established a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the \ngeographic proximity of Taiwan to the PRC.  The geographic closeness might induce \nTaiwan to obtain protected information from United States sources but in obtaining that \ninformation Taiwan does not use tactics and endeavors that could cause issues with the \nUnited States as their main protector and supplier of military equipment. \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. \nBd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); and ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)).  Thus, an administrative judge was not \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. \n \n \nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in Taiwan cause security concerns, I \nconsidered that Taiwan is an ally of the United States, has a defense agreement with \nthe United States, and is one of the United States\u2019 substantial trading partners.  I \nconsidered that Taiwan improved its human rights position and its people enjoy basic \nfreedoms.  While the United States has a one-China policy, the United States does \nmaintain cultural, commercial, and other ties with Taiwan.  I considered that Taiwan \ndoes engage in economic and other types of espionage, and there are instances of \nTaiwan officials and companies engaging in such espionage with individuals in the \nUnited States.  There are no indications in these instances Taiwan was targeting United \nStates citizens to provide economic or other sensitive information.  I also considered \nthat faced with new and competing national interests, the United States policy toward \nTaiwan could change.  While Taiwan is a country that is friendly to the United Stares, it \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncould engage in espionage against United States interests.  Friendly countries may \nhave profound disagreements with the United States or have engaged in espionage \nagainst United States economic, scientific, or technical interest.  A friendly relationship \nis not determinative, but it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt \nto exploit a United States citizen through relatives or associates in that country.  Taiwan \nis not a hostile country, nor is its interests inimical to the United States.  The United \nStates and Taiwan are large democracies, enjoy good relations, and are trading \npartners.  It is reasonable to consider that Taiwan would not take any action to \njeopardize their friendly position with the United States because of their need for trade \nand defense assistance from the United States.  It would be considered an act \nunfriendly to the interest of the United States to coerce its citizens with relatives in the \nUnited States to pressure their United States relatives to provide economic or other \nespionage information against the interest of the United States.  Taiwan has cooperated \nwith the United States in the investigation of espionage incidents with Taiwan.  While \nnone of the considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be \nconsidered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion from his \nfamily members in Taiwan. \n \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 7(a), \n(b), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15).  An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government (See, ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (the \nnature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe United States).  Applicant\u2019s mother is 89 year old has retired from the Taiwan \nbanking system for over 30 years and draws a pension from them. She draws a pension \nfrom her husband's service as a Taiwan government employee.  She is dependent on \nthe government for her pension and medical support.  Applicant\u2019s siblings and their \nspouses are professionals who worked for private businesses in Taiwan.  They are not \ndependent on the Taiwanese government for their subsistence.  Applicant talks to his \nmother frequently, at least once a week, but less to his siblings, about once a month.  \nApplicant made a number of trips to Taiwan for normal visits to his family or on business \nfor his employer.  His mother and siblings have come to the United States to visit and \nstay with him or obtain an education at a United States university.  It is clear that they \nhave a close family relationship.  His contact with his immediate family is frequent and \nnot casual.  Applicant\u2019s information concerning his family members\u2019 living conditions, life \nstyle, and professions, shows it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position to \nchoose between the interests of his family and the interests of the United States.  \nApplicant established his family members in Taiwan are ordinary citizens leading normal \nlives, and that they do not present a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \n\n \n11 \n \n \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  The positions and activities of his family in Taiwan \nshow that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of being coerced or \npressured to choose between these people and his interests in protecting the national \nsecurity of the United States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to duress is also important.  Applicant has been in the \nUnited States for over 33 years, more than half of his life, and a United States citizen for \nover 21 years.  His wife has been a resident of the United States for a similar period and \na United States citizen for the same amount of time.  He has three children born and \neducated in the United States, who are citizens of the United States.  Applicant has \ncontributed to his community by serving on the local school board and running for public \noffice.  Applicant has substantial assets in the United States.  Even though he has \nassets in Taiwan, those assets are about ten percent of his total assets and are with a \nbrokerage company which has the assets in publicly traded stocks.  He has worked for \nand retired from a prestigious laboratory in the United States.  Applicant established FI \nMC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest), and FI MC AG \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, \nfinancial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s numerous and repeated trips to Taiwan were mostly for business and \nto visit family.  He took a trip to Taiwan in 2004 using a Taiwan passport and voted in a \nTaiwan election.  He was taking advantage of a special airline ticket price requiring him \nto obtain the passport and vote in a Taiwanese election.  He was not applying for a \nsecurity clearance at the time so he did not consider that accepting the favorable terms \nof the arrangement from the Taiwan airline was a security concern.  He immediately \nreturned his Taiwan passport to Taiwan after returning from the trip.  In spite of this one \ntrip by Applicant, I find that Applicant has demonstrated that he is not unusually \nvulnerable to duress.   \n \n \nApplicant has a normal sense of loyalty or obligation to his family in Taiwan.  But \nhe also has long standing relationship and connections in the United States.  He has \ndemonstrated that these relationships will lead him to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) and 8(f) apply. \n \n \nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens \nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation).  Applicant has the burden of presenting information to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by the government.  \nApplicant's contact with his mother and siblings and their spouses are not casual and \ninfrequent.  His wife's contacts with her brother and his contact with his brother-in-law \nare minimal and infrequent but not casual.  There is little likelihood that the contacts \n\n \n12 \n \n \ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  Accordingly, FI MC 8(c) applies \nto his wife's brother but not to his mother and siblings in Taiwan.   \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant has met his heavy burden to show that his family contacts and \nfinancial and land holdings in Taiwan do not cause a security concern.  I conclude FI \nMC AGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), (c), and (f) are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept \nrequires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single item in \nisolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness.  Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan both individually and collectively are in \npositions and circumstances that make it unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position \nto choose between the interests of his family and the interest of the United States, or \nthat he can be exploited, pressured, or coerced because of them.  His contacts with his \nfamily in Taiwan are strong but they do not create a conflict of interest between the \nfamily members and his loyalty to the United States.  Applicant has been in the United \nStates for over 33 years and a citizen of the United States for over 21 years.  His \nchildren were born here and are United States citizens.  He has accumulated significant \nassets in the United States, which offset his financial and property interests in Taiwan.  \nHe has had a successful career working for a prestigious laboratory in the United States \nand contributed to his community in the United States.  His travels to Taiwan were for \nbusiness or pleasure and not connected to the Taiwanese government.  He established \nthat his contacts with his family in Taiwan do not indicate a security risk.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s life story is an example of the success of many immigrants to the \nUnited States.  He came to the United States to better himself through education.  He \nremained here, became a United States citizen, established himself in his community, \nand worked to obtain a better life in the United States.  He was very successful in his \nwork with a prestigious laboratory.  The family enjoys a typical United States life style \n\n \n13 \n \n \nand he successfully contributed as a member of society and community in the United \nStates.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office\n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant\nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD\nC3I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness\ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions as\ndefined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated\nJanuary of 1987.\nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) on March 7,\n2006.  (Government Exhibit 1.) On March 21, 2008, DOHA issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and\n\n2\neligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive Automated Data Processing Systems\nPosition (ADP-I/II/III).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 22, 2008, and requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was ready to\nproceed on June 4, 2008.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on June 4, 2008.\nA notice of hearing was issued on June 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 1,\n2008.  \nAt the hearing the Government presented eight exhibits, which were admitted\nwithout objection.  (Government Exhibits 1 through 6.)  The Applicant presented eleven\nexhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J), called one witness and testified on her own\nbehalf.  The record remained open to allow the Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation.  She submitted one additional exhibit, without objection. (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit K.)  The official transcript was received on July 11, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to occupy an Automated\nData Processing position is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 42 years old and single.  She is\nseeking to obtain a determination of trustworthiness in connection with her employment.\n  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a determination of\ntrustworthiness, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons\n(SOR).  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon\ndue consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each\nparagraph and guideline in the SOR:\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to obtain funds.  She\nadmitted all of the allegations under this Guideline.\nThe Applicant began working in the Defense industry in 2006.  Her financial\nproblems began about June 2002, when she left an abusive relationship with her ex-\n\n3\nboyfriend.  She walked out of their apartment, literally with only the clothes on her back,\nand had to start a new life.  (Transcript at 60-61.)  She did not forward her mail, and did\nnot attempt to contact her ex-boyfriend until this case began.  She did not attempt to\ncorrect the situation and her credit got out of hand due to lack of knowledge.  (Transcript\nat 28-30.) The Applicant noted that all of the credit reports obtained by the Government\nrefer to a Post Office Box address that the Applicant never used.  (Government Exhibits\n3 through 6.) \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant admits that she owes approximately\n$10,362.47 to the Department of Education for student loans.  The Applicant was\nmaking occasional payments on this account from 2004 until March of this year.  At that\ntime, the Applicant made a payment arrangement with the collection agency for the\nDepartment of Education.  She made an initial $300.00 payment in March 2008, and\narranged for $120.00 a month to be taken directly out of her bank account.  Including\nher 2007 tax refund and stimulus check, which were also applied directly to her account,\nshe has paid $1,635.00 so far this year towards these debts.  She evinces a credible\nintent to continue to pay these debts until they are paid off.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A;\nTranscript at 24-30, 39-40.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits that a judgment was entered against\nher in 2003 for $4,379.00.  This was related to the apartment she lived in with her ex-\nboyfriend until she left in 2002.  The Applicant\u2019s name was on the lease, along with her\nex-boyfriend.  She did not have her name taken off the lease when she left.  At some\nsubsequent time her ex-boyfriend broke the lease and a judgement was entered against\nthem both.  The Applicant had no knowledge of this judgment until receiving the SOR.\nShe submitted evidence that, at the time the lease was being broken and the judgment\nissued, she was living somewhere else.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nF; Transcript at 30-32.) \nThe Applicant did not have contact information for the collection agency on this\ndebt until receiving the Government\u2019s proposed evidence.  Once she had that\ninformation, the Applicant sent the agency $100.00 on the account, in order to start\nnegotiations with them.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  As of the day of the hearing, she had\nnot heard from this office.  She expresses a credible intent to resolve this indebtedness.\n(Transcript at 40-45.)  Subsequent to the hearing, she submitted a written statement\ndated July 17, 2008, from her ex-boyfriend stating, \u201cI take full responsibility for the\ncircumstances related to this financial obligation.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 8.)  \nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits that she owes approximately $956.00\nto a bank on a credit card.  She stated that she had no notice of this debt until she\nreceived the SOR.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2; Transcript at 45-46.)  She submitted a\n$40.00 payment to this bank to show good faith and begin negotiations.  She expresses\na credible intent to resolve this indebtedness.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D; Transcript at 24-\n35.)\n\n4\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant admits that she owes a hospital $974.00 in\nmedical expenses.  After much research, the Applicant was able to find the collection\nagency and confirm the nature of the debt.  She stated that the address that they were\nbilling was the Post Office Box, discussed earlier, which she never used.  (Transcript at\n35-37, 46-47.)  The Applicant has paid this debt in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 2-3, 9-\n10.)\nThe Applicant stated several times that she did not have notice of many of these\ndebts.  She submitted a signed statement by a friend who says:\nI was in the company of [the Applicant] when she opened a\npackage from a government legal representative that contained her credit\nreport.  She was very surprised to discover many items on [the] credit\nreport that she was unaware of.  I recall her frustration and bewilderment\npertaining to the debts listed on the report.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 7.)\nThe Applicant submitted that her current financial situation is stable.  She is able\nto pay her current debts and work towards resolving her past due indebtedness.  In fact,\nshe submitted evidence that she is paying on a credit card account that is not alleged in\nthe SOR.  (Government\u2019s Exhibits 2 at 2 and 3 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C; Transcript at\n32-34, 51.)  Her credit reports show that she is carrying no current debt whatsoever.\nHer financial difficulties were over a limited time; were related to, or exacerbated by, her\nleaving her abusive ex-boyfriend; and she is working to pay those debts in a satisfactory\nfashion.  (Transcript at 48.)  As of the date the record closed, she had paid $2,749.00\ntowards the debts in the SOR. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a determination of\ntrustworthiness because she made false statements to the Government during her\ninvestigation.  She denied both allegations under this paragraph.\nThe Applicant filled out a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions on March 7,\n2006.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Question 19 asks whether, in the past seven years, the\nApplicant had been subject to a tax lien.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  This was a\nfalse answer, as a tax lien had been filed against her in 1997, and released in\nDecember 2006.  \nQuestion 20 of the same questionnaire asks the Applicant whether, in the last\nseven years, she had been 180 days delinquent on any of her debts.  She answered,\n\u201cYes,\u201d and discussed the debts set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b., above.  She did\nnot disclose the debts set forth in subparagraphs 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.\n\n5\nThe Applicant has consistently maintained, and credibly testified, that she was\nunaware of the lien and the debts when she filled out the questionnaire.  She stated that\nshe suspected she owed back taxes, but had no idea a lien had been filed.  She is\nadamant in stating that she was not intending to deceive the Government with her\nanswers.  (Government Exhibit 2; Transcript at 53-55.) \nMitigation\nThe second line supervisor of the Applicant testified.  He supervises about 85\npeople, and is the person who hired the Applicant.  The witness finds the Applicant to\nbe trustworthy and dependable, stating that she is among his top 10 or 12 workers.  He\nwould lend her money and trust her in an important matter in his own personal life.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J, Transcript at 64-72.)\nThe Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from her direct supervisor.\nHe states, \u201c[The Applicant] has always displayed a high degree of integrity,\nresponsibility and ambition.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  She was named Teammate of the\nMonth for July 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  The Applicant also submitted both of the\nevaluations she has received from her employer.  They show that she is a well-\nrespected and valued employee.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H and K at 11-12.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness determination, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive personal information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive personal information enters into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to such information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nsensitive personal information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such\ninformation.\nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\nfinding of trustworthiness.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts\nto the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which\nis sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the\nultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him or her access.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has had debt problems in the past (Guideline F), and that\nshe gave incorrect answers on a Government questionnaire (Guideline E).  The\nApplicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n7\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant admits that she owes the past due debts in the SOR,\nand has owed them for several years.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  AG \u00b6 20(a) states that it is mitigating where,\n\u201cThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The\nApplicant was forced to leave a long term relationship on short notice because her ex-\nboyfriend abused her.  The record shows that she has not engaged in reckless\npurchasing or showed any other signs of financial poor judgment.  The evidence raises\nthis potentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant did\nnot have a good idea of her debts until this proceeding began.  She has worked hard to\nrepair her credit, has paid a considerable amount of money over the past few months\ntowards her debts, and evinces a credible intent to pay off all of her past due debts.  I\nconclude this potentially mitigating condition applies.  Guideline F is found for the\nApplicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe evidence is clear that the Applicant did not have a good idea of the extent of\nher financial difficulties until receipt of documentation from the Government.  She did\ninform the Government of her largest debts, those set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a.\nand 1.b.  In addition, her credible testimonial evidence is that she had no knowledge of\nany tax lien being filed against her.    \nDespite the Department Counsel\u2019s best efforts, and looked at in the manner most\nfavorable for the Government, the evidence does not support a finding that the\nApplicant intentionally falsified her Questionnaire.  Human beings, and not just the\nApplicant, make mistakes.  She told the Government all the information that she knew.\nThat information was incomplete.  That is all that has happened here.  Guideline E is\nfound for the Applicant.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a good credit\nhistory, with the exception of the debts of concern here.  She was forced to leave an\nabusive relationship, and is still living with the consequences.  The record shows that\nshe is paying her past due debts in a way that is acceptable to her largest creditor.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of\nrecurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations and alleged falsification.\n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a sensitive Systems Position.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and\neligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nWILFORD H.

GE 5 at 4.  \n4\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 14, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b617(c) and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was\nerroneous.   Consistent with the following discussion, we reverse.\n1\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is the Chief Scientist for\na contractor.

Q: For what reason was your access\nrevoked, sir.  A: That was for, essentially, lying on the, you know, on the forms, the previous forms.\u201d      \n3\nfollow-up interview with an investigator, Applicant stated that there were no omissions or errors in\nthe SCA. \nApplicant completed another SCA in 2001.  In this one, he failed to disclose his having used\nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance.  In a subsequent interview, Applicant noted no\nomissions or errors in his SCA.  \nIn 2005, Applicant, who held a special access clearance, was called in for a polygraph\nexamination.  In the pre-polygraph interview, he admitted his prior drug use.   \n5\nIn 2006, he completed a SCA.  On this one, he disclosed his drug use while holding a security\nclearance.  Later that year, he submitted another SCA, this time electronically.  He also disclosed his\nprior drug use on the electronic form.\n Discussion\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In rendering a final decision, an \u201cagency must examine the\nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines,\nInc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The standard applicable in security clearance\ndecisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, the Board will review\nthe Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\n In the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate omissions constituted security concerns under Guideline E.  However, he extended\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 17(c): \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\n6\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d  \n4\nfavorable application to Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 17(c).   The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s last false\n6\nstatement was ten years prior to the hearing and that, since then, \u201cApplicant has repeatedly and\nwillingly disclosed all of his past drug abuse[.]\u201d Decision at 6.   \nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s application of this mitigating\ncondition is not consistent with the totality of the record evidence.  He points to record evidence that\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications began when he lied on his first security clearance application in 1975.\nApplicant finally disclosed his drug use to the Government following a pre-polygraph examination\nin 2005.  Department Counsel Brief at 5.  \nTherefore, as Department Counsel argues, the Judge\u2019s decision does not appear to consider\nthe full extent of Applicant\u2019s false statements, which date back twenty years prior to the earliest one\nalleged in the SOR.  Furthermore, evidence that Applicant admitted his drug use starting in 2005 is\nnot consistent with the Judge\u2019s statement that he had been truthful about it since 2001.  This\nevidence undermines the Judge\u2019s conclusion as to the amount of time which had passed since the\nlast incident of security significant conduct.  \nAdditionally, the circumstances under which Applicant acknowledged his past behavior are\nnot totally consistent with the Judge\u2019s favorable application of \u00b6 17(c).  Applicant\u2019s having made\ndisclosure in anticipation of a polygraph is inconsistent with the Judge\u2019s finding that he did so sua\nsponte.  A reasonable person might conclude that Applicant revealed his past drug use only because\nhe suspected that it would come out during the polygraph exam anyway.  The record provides no\nreason to believe that, had the polygraph not occurred, Applicant would still have admitted his drug\nhistory.  The burden is on Applicant to establish matters in mitigation.  The circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s disclosure vitiate a favorable conclusion under the last clause of \u00b617(c), insofar as they\ncast doubt upon his reliability and good judgment.  \nWe have considered Department Counsel\u2019s argument concerning the Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis.  The Judge listed the nine whole person factors contained in Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(a)\nand stated that he had considered all of the evidence, which left him with no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity worthiness.  While there is no explicit error in this analysis, at the same time it is merely\nconclusory.  We note, for example, that the Judge did not address \u00b6 2(a)(1-3), concerning the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; and the frequency\nof the conduct.  As such, the whole-person analysis provides no additional basis for the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable decision.  \nTo sum up, the record demonstrates that (1) Applicant engaged in the extensive use of illegal\ndrugs while holding a security clearance; (2) he deliberately and repeatedly omitted disclosing this\ndrug use in a series of SCAs and interviews from 1975 to 2001; and (3) he acknowledged his drug\n\n5\nuse only when confronted with a polygraph examination.  We conclude that the record does not\nsupport application of \u00b6 17(c) or any of the other Guideline E mitigating conditions, to the extent that\ntheir application would overcome doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability\nto protect classified information.

Discussion Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9 Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents th evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. In rendering a final decision, an \u201cagency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Robert Bohn, Esquire\nApril 14, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), on October 9, 2006.  On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E and J for the Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 20, 2009.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing through counsel the same day, March 20, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on\nMarch 23, 2009, and the case was assigned to another Judge on October 27, 2009.\nThe case was reassigned to the undersigned on January 11, 2010.  DOHA had already\n\n2\nissued a notice of hearing on December 14, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 2, 2010.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7,\nwhich were received without objection by way of stipulation.  The Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through Q, which were also received\nwithout objection by way of stipulation.  The Applicant further offered AppX R, which\nwas not part of the stipulation, and was received without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on February 17, 2010.  The record closed on February 2,\n2010, the date of the hearing.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nParagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied\nthe factual allegations in Paragraphs 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, and 2.a of the SOR.  He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nPersonal Conduct & Criminal Conduct\nThe Applicant is a 55 year old \u201cChief Scientist\u201d with an aerospace company.  (Tr\nat page 4 line 16 to page 5 line 2, at page 15 line 14 to page 28 line 4, and at page 31\nline 7 to page 32 line 9.)  The Appellant has held a security clearance since 1978,\nwithout any reported incidents regarding his protection of classified materials.  (Id, GX 3\nat page 7, and AppXs A~L and R.)\n1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, and 2.a.  The Applicant used and purchased numerous\nillegal substances from about 1975, while he was attending college, until his last usage\nsometime in 1992, about 18 years ago.  (TR at page 32 line 18 to page 36 line 8.)\nSpecifically, he used and purchased marijuana during this entire period, with his\nheaviest usage being about \u201conce a week\u201d in the \u201cmid-1980's.\u201d  (Id.)  He also used\nmarijuana \u201conce or twice,\u201d during his lunch breaks in about 1985.  (TR at page 35 line\n15 to page 36 line 12.)  He used and purchased cocaine from about 1980 to 1990,\nabout \u201conce a month.  On average.\u201d  (TR at page 37 line 12 to page 39 line 7.)  He used\nand purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms, about \u201cthree times . . . early 80's, about 81\nor so.\u201d  (TR at page 41 lines 5~24.)  He used quaaludes \u201conce . . . about 1983.\u201d  (TR at\npage 40 lines 3~20.)  He also used LSD once in about 1985.  (GX 5 at page 5.)  Finally,\nin 1982, he misused Tylenol with Codeine, which was prescribed to the Applicant who\n\u201cwas recovering from knee surgery,\u201d by taking a double dose to address his pain.  (TR\nat page 42 lines 5~22.)\nThe Applicant executed a Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) in July of\n1995.  (GX 4.)  In answer to questions 22.a., 22.b., and 22.c., the Applicant admittedly\nfailed to disclose his past drug usage, purchases, and his one time misuse of Tylenol,\nas described, above.  (TR at page 45 line 8 to page 49 line 11, and GX 4 at page 4.)\nThese omissions, back in 1995, were a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.\n\n3\n1.d, and 2.a  In a September of 1995 follow up interview with an authorized\ninvestigator, the Applicant noted no omissions or errors on his 1995 PSQ, thus\nadmittedly failing to disclose his past drug abuse.  (TR at page 50 lines 2~25.)  This\nomission was a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.\n1.e, and 2.a  The Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) in\nMay of 2001.  (GX 4.)  In answer to question 28, the Applicant admittedly failed to\ndisclose his past use of illegal drugs and drug activity while holding a security clearance,\nas described above.  (TR at page 51 line 2 to page 52 line 12, and GX 3 at page 6.)\nThis omission, back in 2001, was a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.\n1.f, and 2.a  In a 2001 follow up interview with an authorized investigator, the\nApplicant noted no omissions or errors on his 2001 SCA, thus admittedly failing to\ndisclose his past drug abuse.  (TR at page 52 line 13 to page 53 line 23.)  This omission\nwas a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.\n\u201cIn 2005, . . . [the Applicant] had a Special Access Clearance, and . . . had been\ncalled in for a polygraph exam.\u201d  (TR at page 54 lines 3~16.)  He was then given \u201ca pre-\npoly interview.\u201d  (Id.)  This was not the Applicant\u2019s first polygraph examination, as he\nhad \u201chad other polygraph tests\u201d in the past.  (TR at page 78 lines 9~19.)  It was during\nthis interview that the Applicant first disclosed his past drug abuse.  (Id.).  During the\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s colloquy with the Applicant, the following evidence was elicited:\nQ[uestion]\nIn fact, he, in the pre-polygraph, asked you have you used\ndrugs?\nA[nswer]\nYes.\nQ\nSo, you knew that was going to be a question on the\npolygraph examination?\nA\nNo.  That was not one of the questions on the polygraph\nexamination.\nQ\nIt didn\u2019t turn out to be.  But, when they asked you that pre-\nquestion, let\u2019s be honest, you probably had a good suspicion that he was\ngoing to ask you that or he could have asked that?\nA\nHe could have asked me that.\nQ\nOkay.  So, it wasn\u2019t like you had an epiphany and wanted to\ncome clean.  You basically, stated something that you probably thought\nwas going to come out anyway?\n\n4\nA\nWell, before I went in, I wanted to be totally honest, you\nknow.  Of course, [I] wanted to pass the poly and you have to be honest.\nSo I had already made up my mind.\nQ\nYou knew you had to be honest about your drug use now.\nA\nWell, I mean I wanted to be [as] honest as I could be.  I\nwanted to be forthcoming and answer every question as honestly as\nI could.  (TR at page 78 line 25 to page 80 line 4, emphasis supplied.)\nI find that the Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his past drug abuse was sua sponte.\nIn June of 2006, the Applicant executed another SCA.  (GX 1).  In answer to\nquestion 28., the Applicant disclosed his past use of illegal drugs and drug activity while\nholding a security clearance.  (GX 1 at pages 6~7.)  During the Department Counsel\u2019s\ncolloquy with the Applicant, the following evidence was elicited as to this disclosure:\nQ\nTruth of the matter is there really is no evidence that if you\ndidn\u2019t have to take the polygraph in 2006(sic), that you would have ever\ncome clean.\nA\nI think that when it came time to fill out my 2006 SF-86, I put\neverything down there.  I had my Clearances.  The Investigators at the\ntime kind of led me to believe that there was not going to be any issue with\nmy Security Clearance.\nQ\nWhen did you fill out that 2006 Security Clearance\n[Application]?\nA\nJune of 06.\nQ\nOkay.  When did you take the polygraph?\nA\nProbably the year before in the fall.\nQ\nSo, the truth of the matter is you had to put it on your 2006\nSecurity Clearance Application because you already admitted it to the\npolygraph examiner.\nA\nNo, not necessarily, because they\u2019re two different\norganizations that typically don\u2019t communicate with each other.  [The\n2005 polygraph was taken for SCI access.  The 2006 SCA was filled out\nfor a security clearance.]  (TR at page 81 line 9 to page 82 line 10,\nemphasis supplied.)\n\n5\nIn October of 2006, the Applicant executed an e-QIP.  (GX 2).  In answer to\nquestion 24.b., the Applicant disclosed his past use of illegal drugs and drug activity\nwhile holding a security clearance.  (GX 2 at page 27.)\n1.i.  The Applicant has cross-dressed from about 1972 until about \u201cthree or four\nyears ago.\u201d  (TR at page 64 line 4 to page 67 line 1, and at page 67 line 19 to page 69\nline 17.)  The Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of this activity, which occurs in the privacy of\ntheir home (Id.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n6\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form . . .\u201d may be disqualifying.\nUnder Subparagraph 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an . . . investigator, security official, . . . or other\ngovernment representative\u201d may also be disqualifying.  Here, the Applicant falsified his\n1995 PSQ and his 2001 SCA.  He was also less than candid with the Government in\ntwo interviews, again in 1995 and in 2001.  He did not disclose his past drug\ninvolvement.  These are countered, however, Subparagraph 17(c) as \u201cso much time has\npassed . . . that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s last falsification was\nnearly ten years ago.  Since then, the Applicant has repeatedly and willingly disclosed\nall of his past drug abuse, that occurred about 18 years ago.  Furthermore, those who\nknow the Applicant in the work place do not question his integrity and personal conduct.\n(AppXs A~D, and R).\nIt is alleged and admitted that the Applicant is a cross dresser.  Arguably, the\ndisqualifying condition noted in Subparagraph 16(e) is applicable; i.e., \u201cpersonal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress . . . .\u201d  This is clearly countered, however, by\nSubparagraph 17(e) as the Applicant \u201chas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  Here, the Applicant last cross\ndressed three or four years ago, in the privacy of his home, and his wife knows about it.\n\n7\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Criminal Conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Paragraph 31(c) provides that an \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant\u2019s falsifications in 1995 and\nagain in 2001 were violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  Here, this is clearly countered by\nSubparagraph 32(a) as \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal happened . . . that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Again, his last falsification occurred ten years ago.\nSince then, the Applicant has repeatedly and willingly disclosed all of his past drug\nabuse.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept.  The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a):\n\u201c\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The Applicant has the unqualified support\nof those who know him in the work place (AppXs A~D, and R).  The record evidence\nleaves me with no questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from his Personal Conduct and related Criminal Conduct. \n\n8\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 29, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On May 30, 2008, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Henry Lazzaro granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\napplication of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FPMC) 11(b) is unsupported by record\nevidence.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.

Her father is now deceased, and her mother is a naturalized\nU.S. citizen who lives with Applicant in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s husband was born in Mexico but has\nbeen a U.S. citizen since 1977.\nIn 2001 Applicant applied for, and received, Mexican citizenship.

Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Applicant did not file\na brief on appeal.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not an issue in this appeal.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.11(b): \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship[.]\u201d This\n1\nmitigating condition is unchanged from the previous version of the Adjudicative Guidelines, found at Directive \u00b6\nE2.A3.1.3.4.  See ISCR Case No. 06-23453 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007) (Prior precedent \u201cremains valid where the\napplicable language of the guideline is unchanged or the changes are not of sufficient magnitude to vitiate or overrule\nthe substance of the precedent.\u201d)\n3\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant, by stating she would renounce her Mexican citizenship,\nhad met her burden of persuasion as to mitigation under Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition\n11(b).   The Chief Department Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s willingness to renounce is\n1\nconditional and, therefore, entitled to less weight than an expression of unconditional willingness\nto do so.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 99-0295 (App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2000).  See ISCR Case No. 01-16098\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 29, 2003).  The Board has considered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of his\nunchallenged findings of fact.  Applicant chose to have the case decided upon the written record,\nwith the  result that her credibility could not be evaluated in the context of a hearing.  See ISCR Case\n\n4\nNo. 08-00899 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008).  Applicant did not to reply to the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material; nor did she submit a reply brief on appeal.  Given the Judge\u2019s unchallenged\nfindings that Applicant actively acquired Mexican citizenship and that she registered to vote in\nMexico; his unchallenged finding that she expressed merely a conditional willingness to renounce\nher Mexican citizenship; and the paucity of record evidence as to mitigation, the Board concludes\nthat, on the facts of this case, Applicant has failed to meet her burden of persuasion under the Egan\nstandard.   See ISCR Case No. 99-0511 at 9 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2000) (The weight reasonably to be\nassigned an applicant\u2019s willingness to renounce foreign citizenship should be determined in the\ncontext of the \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard.)  The record, viewed as a\nwhole, will not sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \n \nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR,\nsigned by her on March 14, 2008, in which she admitted all SOR allegations and requested\na clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 9, 2008,\nthat was mailed to Applicant on April 14, 2008, and received by her on April 16, 2008.\nApplicant was informed she had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit her\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMay 30, 2008\n\n A questionnaire for sensitive positions submitted by Applicant in March 2007 (Ex. 4), lists Applicant\u2019s\n2\nmother\u2019s citizenship as being Mexican, but also includes the date of 08/27/1984 as the citizenship date,\nprovides a citizenship certificate number, and then goes on to describe the document as alien registration.\n2\nobjections to information contained in the FORM or submit any material she wished to be\nconsidered. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM or object to anything\ncontained in the FORM within the time allowed her. The case was assigned to me on May\n27, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old woman who has been employed by a defense contractor\nsince January 2002, currently as a property management administrator. She was\npreviously employed in private industry as an electronic inspector from February 1998 to\nDecember 2001, as a quality inspector for the same company through a temporary agency\nfrom January 1998 to February 1998, and as a quality clerk by a different company from\nMay 1994 to January 1998. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth, having been born in a city very near her current\nresidence in January 1963. Applicant\u2019s mother was born in Mexico and either became a\nU.S. citizen in August 1984 or obtained resident alien status at that time.  Her mother\n2\nresides in the United States near where Applicant lives. \nApplicant possesses a U.S. passport that was last issued in June 2001. She has\nresided in the same residence since January 1994. She attended a vocational school from\nJanuary 2005 to October 2005, and a real estate school from December 2006 to February\n2007, in order to obtain a real estate license. She currently has a conditional real estate\nlicense and is required to successfully complete two additional classes to obtain a full\nlicense. \nApplicant was first married in January 1979. That marriage ended in divorce in\nOctober 2000. Her husband was born in Mexico, but at some undisclosed time became a\nU.S. citizen. Applicant has a 26-year-old son, a 25-year-old son, and a 22-year-old\ndaughter who were born during this marriage. Applicant\u2019s daughter resides with her. Her\nyounger son lives nearby, while her oldest son is serving on active duty with the U.S. Army\nand living in another state. \nApplicant has been remarried since October 2003. Her husband was born in Mexico\nin 1952, but became a U.S. citizen in November 1977. His father was a citizen of Mexico\nbut is now deceased. His mother became a U.S. citizen in September 1996, and currently\nlives near Applicant\u2019s place of residence. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n3\nApplicant visited Mexico for approximately three days in March 1999, and for about\none week in October 2003. She lives a short distance from the U.S. - Mexican border and\nreports she has made many one-day trips to Mexico during the past seven years. \nSometime in approximately 2001, Applicant applied for Mexican citizenship by\nsubmitting an application at the Mexican consulate near her US. residence. She did so\nsolely because she was required to be a citizen of Mexico in order to purchase real estate\nin Mexico and she and her husband were contemplating buying property in Mexico on\nwhich they could build a vacation home. Her application for Mexican citizenship was\napproved about two months after she applied. \nIn April 2003, Applicant and her husband paid $7,000 for a vacant parcel of land in\nMexico. She estimates it is now valued at $15,000. She and her husband hope to\neventually build a vacation home on this parcel of land but currently use it as a place to\npark a recreational vehicle when on vacation. They used money from their savings to pay\nfor the land and do not rely on the land for income. Applicant applied for voting rights in\nMexico to secure her ownership of the land and to obtain some kind of identification card\nto prove her Mexican citizenship. She has not actually voted in any Mexican election. \nApplicant has not otherwise exercised any right of Mexican citizenship. She does\nnot have any relatives living in Mexico and does not have any contact with foreign nationals\nother than when she vacations in Mexico. She asserts her sole loyalty is to the United\nStates and she is willing to renounce her Mexican citizenship if it is a condition of her\nobtaining a security clearance. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline C (foreign preference),\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant applied for and received Mexican citizenship and the right to vote in\nMexican elections. She applied for that citizenship and the right to vote so she could\npurchase vacation property in Mexico and to obtain identification that would identify her as\na Mexican citizen. Additionally, she has purchased and presently owns a parcel of vacant\nland in Mexico that is valued at about $15,000. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 10(a):\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited\nto: (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits\nfrom a foreign country; . . . (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business\ninterests in another country; and 10(b): action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen apply. \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s sole reason for obtaining Mexican citizenship and securing a right to vote\nin Mexican elections was to facilitate the purchase of a small parcel of land on which she\nand her husband hope to eventually build a vacation home. She has resided in the U.S.\nher entire life and lived in the same residence for the past 14 years. Applicant raised three\nchildren in this country who are all U.S. citizens and residents. Her oldest son is serving\nin the armed forces of the United States. All of her relatives are U.S. citizens and/or\nresidents. She has no other contact with foreign nationals or Mexico other than as a\nvacation site. She has attended formal schooling in her state of residence to obtain a real\nestate license in that state.\n  \nThere is no record evidence to indicate Applicant has a \u201cpreference\u201d for Mexico over\nthe United States or that she has any interest in Mexico other than as a personally\ndesirable vacation spot. That vacation interest is one she shares with thousands if not\nmillions of her fellow U.S. citizens. Applicant did not obtain Mexican citizenship as a display\nof preference for that country but rather to facilitate long-term vacation plans for her and\nher husband. She clearly demonstrated her allegiance to the U.S., and her lack of interest\nin Mexico as anything other than a vacation site, by expressing her willingness to renounce\nher Mexican citizenship.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 31, 2007. On February 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its action to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 14, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR allegations in writing on March 4, 2008. On April 16, 2008, he requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On June 16, 2008, the government submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a\nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n2\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nNo response was received by the July 24, 2008, due date. On August 15, 2008, the\ncase was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. Based upon a review of the\ngovernment\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 2),\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent federal student loan debt totaling credit card debt totaling $27,620 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a through 1.f). Applicant admitted the debts (Item 2). After considering the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old associate designer who has worked for a defense\ncontractor since September 2006. The available record does not show that he has ever\nheld a security clearance (Item 4).\nApplicant attended college from August 1994 to July 2001. While in school, he\nworked as a lot attendant for a home improvement retailer. In about January 2001, he\nwas fired for refusing to perform a task. He then worked as a forklift operator, staying on\nthe job for almost two years after he earned his bachelor of science degree. In about\nMay 2003, he began working as a driver, initially for a company contracted to deliver\npackages for a major shipping company. He was involuntarily terminated for time clock\nissues in November 2003 but found work as a driver for another company. In\nSeptember 2003, he entered the defense sector as a trainee designer for his present\nemployer (Item 4).\nNeeding a security clearance for his duties, Applicant executed an e-QIP on\nJanuary 31, 2007. He disclosed under section 22 concerning his employment record\nthat he had been fired from previous jobs in January 2001 and in May 2003. In\nresponse to section 27 concerning his financial record, Applicant indicated a judgment\nhad been awarded against him in August 2003, and a wage garnishment action had\nbeen initiated in May 2005, to recover about $35,000 in delinquent federal student\nloans. Applicant also listed the delinquent student loan debt in response to questions 28\na. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28\nb. \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d (Item 4).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on February 28, 2007, revealed that he had\ndefaulted on six federal student loans taken out between November 1995 and\nNovember 1998 totaling $20,000. In April 2004, an aggregate debt balance of $25,694\nwas referred for collection. As of January 2007, he owed about $26,613 in student loan\ndebt. He was making timely payments of $264 per month on an auto loan taken out in\nJune 2004 for $11,619, and had no outstanding credit card debt. A delinquent credit\ncard debt of $439 had been referred for collection in July 2006, but he paid it in October\n2006 (Item 5).\n\nThe file available for review does not include any statement from Applicant or any report from the investigator\n1\nabout the interview. In its interrogatories to Applicant of November 2007, DOHA referenced an interview of\nMay 23, 2007, during which Applicant had apparently indicated a willingness to resolve his indebtedness, and\nasked him to furnish documentation of efforts made to resolve his debts (see Item 6). W hen he responded to\nthe interrogatories, Applicant did not deny that he had been interviewed in May 2007 or that he had expressed\nat that time a willingness to resolve his debts.\n3\nDuring an interview with a government investigator on or about May 23, 2007,1\nApplicant expressed his willingness to resolve his indebtedness. Asked by DOHA to\ndocument repayment of his six delinquent student loans, Applicant indicated on\nNovember 20, 2007, that his loan debt had been consolidated. The assignee collecting\nthe student loan debt had garnished his pay with his previous employer. To avoid\nanother garnishment, he promised to pay the collection agency at least $150 per month.\nWhile he had been given an option to rehabilitate his loans out of default status on\npayment of $360 per month for nine months, Applicant averred he could not afford it. He\nexpressed his intent to enroll in the rehabilitation payment option by May 2008:\nAfter my interview, I immediately contacted [the collection agency] to\ndiscuss my account as presented above. I started by making a May and\nJune payment of $150 each. I paid by money order and have enclosed a\ncopy of my May receipt. Unfortunately, I mailed the June receipt with the\nmoney order. I did not make any more since then because I never got any\nconfirmation of my payments. Therefore, I continued to communicate with\n[the collection agency] to verify my two payments. The payments did not\nshow up in their system until October. They did receive my May payment,\nbut did not receive my June payment. It was probably a mistake on my\npart because I do not remember putting my social security number on the\nmoney order as instructed before. As of now, I plan to make a November\npayment and will continue to do so until May 2008. Then I plan to proceed\nin enrolling in the credit rehabilitation program.\nApplicant provided DOHA with a copy of one money order receipt showing a $150\npayment on May 28, 2007 (Item 6).\nA subsequent check of Applicant\u2019s credit on January 28, 2008, showed Applicant\nhad paid off his old car loan in April 2007. He had taken out a new vehicle loan of\n$16,743 in March 2007. The loan, which was being repaid on time at $309 per month,\nhad an outstanding balance of $15,385 as of December 2007. His student loans were\nstill in collection with a total balance of $27,640 (Item 7).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit report of January 28, 2008 (Item 7) shows the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f to be $1,726 rather than\n2\nthe $1,706 alleged. This would explain the $20 discrepancy between the amount of total student loan debt\nlisted on the credit report and that alleged in the SOR. \nAs Department Counsel correctly noted, Applicant presented proof of only the May 2007 payment.\n3\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant owes about $27,640 in delinquent federal student loan debt that has\nbeen in default since at least April 2004.  Significant security concerns are raised by\n2\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nAG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) clearly does not apply\ngiven he has not even managed to rehabilitate the loans. While it appears that he held a\nseries of blue collar jobs as a forklift operator and then as a driver even after he earned\nhis B.S. degree, he did not provide sufficient evidence to implicate AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d). He failed to provide any income or living expenses figures\nthat might have excused his inaction on his student loans.\nWhat little is known about his financial situation is that his monthly car payments\nincreased by $45 after he took out a new car loan of $16,743 in March 2007. This car\nloan raises questions of self-interest in the absence of any evidence showing need for a\nnew vehicle. He made no payments on his delinquent student loans until after his\ninterview with a government investigator in May 2007, and he failed to follow through on\npromises made to the agency collecting the student loan debt. Offered an option to\nrehabilitate his student loans by making nine consecutive monthly payments of $366,\nApplicant countered that he would pay $150 monthly as he could not afford the full\n$366. By November 2007, he had made two payments at most, which were in May and\nJune 2007.  Even if I accept that he was justified in not making any additional payments\n3\nuntil the creditor verified receipt in October 2007, Applicant told DOHA in November\n2007 that he would resume the $150 monthly payment until May 2008 when he would\nthen start the process of rehabilitating his loans. There is no evidence that Applicant\nmade any payments in November 2007 or thereafter, despite the fact that he was\nnotified of the government\u2019s concerns in the February 2008 SOR and again in the June\n2008 FORM. Under the circumstances, I am unable to apply either AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe\n\n6\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) or AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe government must be assured that those persons with classified access can\nbe counted on to exercise good judgment at all times. Although Applicant has been\ncandid about his defaulted student loan debt, he remains under a significant debt\nburden that is not likely to resolve in the foreseeable future. As of May 2007, he could\nnot afford the $366 monthly payment necessary to rehabilitate his loans. Based on the\nrecord before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The Applicant is 38 years of age and has a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering. He is employed as a Mechanical Engineer for a defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Hong Kong, China in 1969. He was adopted by his uncle and moved to the United States when he was ten years old. (Tr. p. 32). Since then, he has lived in the United States, attended American schools, and fully assimilated into the American culture. In fact, he has never considered himself to be a part of the Chinese culture. (Tr. p. 33). He married an American woman of Italian descent and they have two children who were born in the United States.

On February 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on February 27, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.

The\nApplicant stated, \u201cThere is no reason for me to help China in anything in any way\u201d.  (Tr.\np. 34).\nThe Applicant explained that although his biological father is a citizen and\nresident of Hong Kong, China, the Applicant did not grow up with him.  The Applicant\nand his biological father are not close, they have no parental bond, and no relationship\nof that sort.  As a matter of respect, the Applicant has minimal contact with his biological\nfather, maybe once a year or so, or on holidays, and only because of the Applicant\u2019s\nrespect for his Christian upbringing, which says that he should \u201chonor his father and\nmother\u201d.  (Tr. p. 35).  Copies of the Applicant\u2019s telephone bills for 2006 and 2007 verify\nthis.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  \nIn responding to interrogatories concerning this investigation, the Applicant\nindicated that his biological father was self-employed, manufactured L.C.D. screens\nfrom home, and is attempting to find investors for his business.  (Government Exhibit 2).\nThe Applicant was unsure about his responses and asked his mother to help him to\nprovide information about his biological father for the Department of Defense.  (Tr. p.\n\n3\n36).  The Applicant admits that he was mistaken about the information he provided the\nDoD concerning his biological father.  The Applicant stated that the reason his biological\nfather went to Hong Kong  instead of to China is because the family hated Communism\nso much and wanted to get away from it.  (Tr. p. 38).  A copy of the Applicant\u2019s\nbiological father\u2019s resume indicates that he was educated at MIT in the field of\nMechanical Engineering and then returned to Hong Kong.  Over the years he has been\ninvolved in various business ventures in Hong Kong and/or has done consulting work in\nthe clothing and garment industry, the automobile industry, the computer industry, the\nreal estate industry, and power plants and the manufacture of wind turbines.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  He is not a member, nor has he ever been a member, of the\nCommunist party or any other political or government agency and has no ties to such.\nHe is a devout Christian and has been involved with the church on a volunteer basis for\nmany years in various capacities.  With the exception of still being Chairman of the\nChina Bible Seminary, he has retired from all of his other jobs and is no longer\nemployed.  The Applicant\u2019s biological father has decided to permanently move to the\nUnited States to live with the Applicant\u2019s biological mother.  He has recently applied for\ncitizenship in the United States and is awaiting his application processing.  (Tr. pp. 37-\n38).\nThe Applicant contacted his biological father for the limited purpose of alerting\nhim to the fact that the Department of Defense may contact him and question him\nconcerning the Applicant, as the Applicant is applying for a security clearance.  The\nApplicant\u2019s father is not aware of any other details concerning the Applicant.  For the\nmost part, the Applicant\u2019s biological father has never shown interest concerning the\nApplicant, his wife or his family in the United States.  \nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s biological father has a background in Mechanical\nEngineering, just as the Applicant does, the Applicant has never and will not ever\ndiscuss any work issues with him.  The Applicant does not talk to his father about his\nwork as he takes his responsibilities very seriously. On those rare occasions where the\nApplicant may have the opportunity to talk with his biological father, they talk about the\nApplicant\u2019s son and his health problems.         \nThe Applicant\u2019s uncle, who adopted the Applicant at the age of ten, is the\nApplicant\u2019s father for all intends and purposes.  The Applicant considers him to be his\nfather.  He is a citizen and resident of the United States and has raised the Applicant as\nhis own son.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s biological mother, immigrated to the United States in the 80's, is\na citizen and resident of the United States and is teaching Chinese Bible Church.  The\nApplicant lived with her for a short time when he came to the United States but now only\nvisits her on holidays.           \nA letter of compelling need from the Applicant\u2019s employer dated April 17, 2008,\nindicates that the Applicant, with over ten years of experience in the field, provides key\nskills necessary for solid Engineering support.  He is a dedicated employee and can be\ntrusted to perform his task with the highest quality and integrity and is strongly\nrecommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A). \n\n4\nIn winter 1994, the Applicant was awarded for his academic achievement and\nwas on the Dean\u2019s Honor List at the College of Engineering he was attending. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  The Applicant received a certificate from the American Society\nof Mechanical Engineers for a design entry in the National Student Design Competition\nheld at a University in March 1995.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Peoples Republic\nof China (PRC), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong), and the\nMacau Special Administrative Region (Macau).  While the Hong Kong government\ngenerally respects the human rights of its citizens, under PRC nationality law, persons\nwho are of Chinese descent and who were born in the mainland China or Hong Kong\nare PRC citizens. The People's Republic of China is a Communist country that its\npolitics, society and human rights records remain inconsistent with United States\nsystem of democracy and freedom.  It is the most populous country in the world, is\neconomically powerful, and is an important trading partner of the United States.  It has\nstrong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.  The United States is a primary\nintelligence target of China because its role as a global superpower; its substantial\nmilitary, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a\ndeveloper of advanced technology that China requires for economic growth and the\nlarge number of Americans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence\ntargets by the PRC.  The PRC engages in espionage against the United States through\nan extensive network of businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to\nacquire advanced U.S. military technology.  One approach is to covertly conduct\nespionage by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and\nmilitary industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services.  This is believed to\nbe the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States.  It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information,\nand sometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information\ntransfers.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n5\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which\nthese person are located, or the positions or activities of those person in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \n\n6\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence ad has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\n\n7\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the\ncountry in which these person are located, or the positions or activities of those person\nin that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S, and 8(c) Contact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s biological father is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong,\nChina, the Applicant is not close to him and rarely contacts him.  There is no evidence\nof a close bond or strong evidence of affection.  In fact, to the contrary, the Applicant\u2019s\nbiological father was never there for the Applicant growing up and the Applicant\u2019s only\nrespect for him at all is because of the Applicant\u2019s Christian convictions.  All of the\nApplicant\u2019s close family members are citizens and residents of the United States.  The\nApplicant\u2019s adopted father, his biological mother, his wife and their two children are all\nresidents and citizens of the United States.  The Applicant does not consider himself to\never have been a part of the Chinese culture and essentially cut all ties from China\nwhen he moved to the United States as a youngster.  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Hong Kong, China elevates the\ncause for concern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no\nbond and affection with his biological father or to any foreign individual or to  Hong Kong\nor China in any way that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore there\nis no possibility of foreign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct\nresulting in the compromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not\nvulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant:\nWilliam L. Bruckner, Esquire\nBruckner & Walker\nMarch 17, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on December 19, 2006 (Government Exhibit 1).  On September 15, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guidelines J, G and E concerning the Applicant.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on October 3, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\n\n2\non November 13, 2008.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on\nNovember 17, 2008.  I received the case assignment on December 18, 2008.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 4, 2009.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one\nadditional witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, also without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on February 10, 2009.  The record closed on that\ndate.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 39 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the Defense\nindustry.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges under Guideline J that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.  The Government further alleges\nunder Guideline G that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses\nintoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs\n1.a. through 1.g. of the SOR.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nBased on statements in his Answer, the Applicant is deemed to have denied Paragraph\n2 and its subparagraph. \nThe Applicant has had five alcohol related arrests or citations from 1989 to 2005.\nHe has been charged with Minor in Possession of Alcohol, has three convictions for\nDriving Under the Influence, and one conviction for Battery on a Police Officer.  In\naddition, he has twice been charged with Violation of Probation.  He is currently on\nprobation for his most recent conviction, and will be on probation until February 2011.  \nThe Applicant was charged with Minor in Possession of Alcohol in 1989.  He was\n19 and was drinking a 12 pack of beer a weekend at the time he was arrested.\n(Transcript at 59-60.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s second alcohol related incident happened in April 1996.  He was\narrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) after drinking about eight or\nnine beers.  He stated that his consumption of alcohol was about an 18-pack a week.\nHe was fined, put on three years probation and ordered to attend a Drinking Driver\nProgram.  The Applicant testified that, at the time, he did not think the DUI was \u201ca big\ndeal.\u201d  (Transcript at 60-61.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s third alcohol related incident, and second arrest for DUI,\noccurred in December 2001.  He has stated that he had four to nine beers to drink that\n\n3\nnight.  (Transcript at 61; Government Exhibit 3 at 6.)  In January 2002, he plead guilty\nand received a sentence including five years probation, a fine, jail time, a Drinking\nDriver Course and his driver\u2019s license was restricted.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 13, 17-\n21.)  In addition, one of the requirements of his probation is that he, \u201cNot drink or\npossess any alcoholic beverages.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 4 at 19.)\nThe Applicant was charged with a Violation of Probation in August 2002.\nAccording to the Applicant, this occurred because he was stopped for driving without a\nlicense and had nothing to do with him drinking alcohol.  He had to serve two days in jail\nfor the violation and his probation was reinstated.  (Transcript at 62-65; Government\nExhibit 4 at 21-22.)\nThe Applicant was involved in an altercation with the police in August 2005.  He\nwas drinking beer, in violation of his probation, with some friends at a restaurant.  He\nhad drank about eight beers over a four hour period.  Some friends of his got in a fight\nand, after the police were called, the entire group was asked to leave the restaurant.\nThe Applicant got into an argument with the police and bumped into a policeman.\n(Government Exhibit 3 at 5-6.)  At the hearing, the Applicant first testified that he was\n\u201cbasically in [the officer\u2019s] face,\u201d and that\u2019s why the Applicant was arrested.  (Transcript\nat 53.)  He later admitted the physical contact.  (Transcript at 65-66.)  He plead guilty\nand received a fine, three years informal probation, and four days work furlough.\n(Government Exhibit 4 at 24-29.)  He was charged with a Violation of Probation on this\noffense in November 2005, based on his third arrest for DUI, discussed immediately\nbelow.  His probation was subsequently revoked and reinstated.\nThe Applicant was arrested for DUI in October 2005.  He had eight or nine beers\nto drink and was arrested.  (Transcript at 66-67; Government Exhibit 3 at 5.)  Drinking\nviolated his probation for the December 2001 DUI conviction.  He plead guilty in\nFebruary 2006 and received a sentence including five years probation, a fine, jail time,\nattend a Drinking Driver Program (Multiple Conviction Program) and required use of an\nignition interlock device.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 30-36.)  In addition, one of the\nrequirements of this probation is that he, \u201cNot drink or possess any alcoholic\nbeverages.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 4 at 34.)  This probation is due to run until February\n2011.  He attended and completed the Drinking Driver Program.  (Transcript at 73-75;\nGovernment Exhibit 4 at 14-15.)\nThe Applicant did not drink alcohol for a year and a half after this arrest.  He\nbegan drinking alcohol again in about July 2007.  The Applicant knew when he began\ndrinking that the act violated his probation.  The Applicant\u2019s explanation is that he likes\nthe taste of alcohol, but knows to limit himself to one beer.  He further stated the last\ntime he had a beer was in September 2008.  Finally, he testified that he was not going\nto drink in the future.  (Transcript at 71-72, 76-79, 84-85.)\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Government during the\n\nThe SOR was amended to show December 19, 2006, as the date the Questionnaire was signed.  This was\n1\nto comport with the evidence.  (Transcript at 15-18.)\n4\nclearance screening process.  The Applicant denied the single allegation under this\nguideline.\n1.a. The Applicant filled out an e-QIP on December 19, 2006.   In that\n1\nQuestionnaire the Applicant answered Section 23, concerning his criminal record, by\nsetting forth his two arrests in 2005 and his arrest for DUI in 2001.  He did not admit his\nDUI arrest in 1996, or his being charged in 1989 with Minor in Possession of Alcohol.  \nThe Applicant denies falsifying this answer, stating that he had forgotten about\nthese two incidents, since they had occurred 13 and 20 years previously.  (Transcript at\n52; Government Exhibit 3 at 6.)\nMitigation\nThe owner of the Defense contractor the Applicant works for testified on the\nApplicant\u2019s behalf.  The witness is aware of the Applicant\u2019s DUI problems, but not of the\narrest and conviction for Battery on a Police Officer.  He believes the Applicant has\nturned things around, and believes in him enough to be willing to pay the extra\ninsurance required for the Applicant to drive company vehicles.  (Transcript at 26-47;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG \u00b6 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n6\nThe Applicant was involved in five alcohol related incidents between 1989 and\n2005.  Three were arrests for DUI.  The Applicant has used alcohol from about 1985\nuntil at least September 2008.  He stated that he does not intend to use alcohol in the\nfuture.  The Applicant is currently on probation for his last conviction and will be on\nprobation until February 2011.  He has violated that probation by drinking alcohol.\nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are\napplicable.  AG \u00b6 31.(a) \u201cA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n31.(d) \u201cIndividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the Mitigating Conditions\nunder Criminal Conduct do not apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 32.(a), states it may be\nmitigating where, \u201cSo much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or\nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d  In addition,\nAG \u00b6 32.(d) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cThere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \nWhile it has been almost four years since his last arrest, the Applicant has a long\nrecord of excessive drinking with criminal consequences.  In addition, as he testified, he\nknowingly is violating his probation by drinking alcohol, and has done that for some\ntime.  He testified that he only has one beer, but given his history I find that testimony\ndubious at best.  The Applicant has been on probation continuously for the last seven\nyears, and for ten of the last thirteen.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I\ncannot find that it is in the national interest to give him a clearance while he is on\nprobation, especially when he violated that probation less than a year ago.\nThere are two Disqualifying Conditions concerning Alcohol Consumption that\napply to this case.  AG \u00b6 22.(a) \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 22.(g) applies, \u201cFailure to follow\nany court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\u201d   \nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the Mitigating Conditions\nunder Alcohol Consumption do not apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 23.(a) states that it can be\na mitigating condition when, \u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 23.(b) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cThe individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\n\n7\nAs stated above, even though the Applicant\u2019s last alcohol related arrest was four\nyears ago, he continues to drink alcohol in defiance of a court order.  He testified that he\nunderstands he has an alcohol problem and is going to change his life, but his history\nbelies his statements.  While it may not be demonstrably false, his testimony was\nobviously self-serving and entitled to little weight.  His conduct by definition does not\nshow reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\nThe Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of his alcohol\nconsumption and related criminal conduct.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR are found\nagainst the Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Applicant admitted in his Questionnaire his three most recent alcohol-related\narrests.  The two he did not admit occurred 13 and 20 years in the past.  His statement\nthat he simply forgot about the incidents due to the passage of time is credible and\nworthy of belief.  I find that the Applicant did not have the requisite intent to deceive the\nGovernment when he filled out this Questionnaire.  Paragraph 3 is found for the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has had five alcohol\nrelated arrests in 20 years.  The acts are frequent and recent.  He continues to drink\nalcohol, in violation of his probation.  They also show a pattern of alcohol dependence\nand/or alcohol abuse.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at length above,\nI find that the that there have not been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of continuation or recurrence is very high (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n8\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents, and the related criminal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.  As set forth above, Paragraph 3 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Coacher, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 29, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn May 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 23, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 26, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 52 years of age.\nIn 1999, applicant was indicted on the following charges: (1) Aggravated Assault,\nDeadly Weapon/Dangerous Instrument, a felony, (2) Aggravated Assault, Serious\nPhysical Injury, a felony, and (3) Attempted First Degree Murder, a felony. He pleaded\nguilty \nto \nthe \namended \ncharge \nof \nAttempted \nAggravated \nAssault, \nDeadly\nWeapon/Dangerous Instrument, a felony. He was sentenced to six years in prison and\nordered to pay $30,936.53 in restitution. He was incarcerated from April 2000 to\nDecember 2004.\nAccording to applicant, the incident that led to the aforementioned charges\noccurred as follows: He was a bounty hunter who went to the residence of a man he\nintended to arrest on a number of outstanding warrants. When he knocked on the front\ndoor, a woman (who just happened to be applicant\u2019s former girlfriend) answered the\ndoor. When applicant announced he was there to arrest the man, the man came to the\ndoor, an argument ensued, applicant pulled out a handgun, the man tried to grab the\nhandgun, the handgun discharged, and the man was hit by a bullet. The man was\ncritically inured but survived.\nIn the Pre-Sentence report (Exhibit 10), the following is reported under the\nheading \u201cDefendant\u2019s Statement\u201d:\nThe defendant disagreed with the information contained in the statement\nof offense. He did not express remorse and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything\nfor the guy. He grabbed the gun and he got shot.\u201d He said for six months\nhe was having negative dealings with the victim and the witness. The\nwitness was a former girlfriend who lived with him prior to moving into the\nvictim\u2019s residence. He said he told her to leave his residence because she\nwas smoking crack and dealing drugs out of his home. The victim and the\nwitness had stolen property from his home. He reported several attempts\nto get officers or deputies to arrest the victim because he was a fugitive\nfrom the jail and had several outstanding warrants. He was unsatisfied\nwith the deputies\u2019 response so he went to arrest the victim himself. \u201cI felt it\nwas my turn. A couple of deputies told me before, you are a bounty hunter\nyou get him. There should have been no reason to shoot the guy, but\nwhen I said I wanted to make a citizen\u2019s arrest he tried to take my gun\nfrom me.\u201d He took the gun to the residence because he believed the victim\nwas dangerous.\nApplicant was not a licensed bounty hunter, and he had no \u201cbounty\u201d on the man.\nViewing the evidence as a whole, it is obvious there was a lot more to this incident that\nan accidental shooting during an honest attempt to make a citizen\u2019s arrest.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\n\n4\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s felony conviction raises this disqualifying\ncondition.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 32.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under Paragraph 32.d., it may be\nmitigating if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d Although applicant\u2019s criminal conviction occurred about eight years ago,\nhis lack of remorse, and failure to offer any positive evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation from independent sources who know him well (e.g., family, friends,\ncoworkers, supervisors) preclude application of either mitigating condition.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a mature man when\nhe engaged in the criminal conduct. Even if it is assumed that the gun was accidentally\ndischarged as applicant claims, he exercised incredibly poor judgment by arming\nhimself and attempting to make a citizen\u2019s arrest on a man he knew was dangerous and\nwith whom he had been feuding.  Although this was an isolated incident that occurred\nover eight years ago, applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for his reckless conduct\nand poor judgment, and failure to offer any credible independent evidence that suggests\nhe is unlikely to exercise such poor judgment in the future, leaves me no choice but to\nconclude he failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline J.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She obtained visas to visit Applicant in the U.S. in 1991 and 1992. In\nSeptember 1994, she immigrated to the U.S. as a legal permanent resident. They\nmarried later in September 1994. They have two daughters, both native-born U.S.\ncitizens. Applicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s parents, a brother, a sister, and a half-brother are resident citizens of\nCote d\u2019Ivoire. None of them has any connection to the government. Applicant is not\nclose to his parents or his siblings, and does not have much communication with them.\nThis was part of a cultural dynamic in which first-born sons (which Applicant was not)\nare favored over later-born sons. It was also part of a family dynamic in which Applicant\ndid not learn until much later in life that some of who he thought were his brothers were,\nin fact, half brothers. Applicant also has three sisters and a half-brother who are dual\ncitizens of Cote d\u2019Ivoire and the U.S., and who reside in the U.S. One of his sisters was\na broadcaster for Voice of America, who had official contacts with many governments in\nAfrica, including that of Cote d\u2019Ivoire. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a resident citizen of the Peoples Republic of China,\nwho has no connection to the government. Applicant\u2019s wife has a cousin who is\nemployed in the department of education. She and her parents were divorced when she\nwas quite small, and she was raised by her paternal grandparents. Consequently she\nsaw little of her parents until adulthood. She has very little contact with her mother or\nthe cousin who works for the government. Her father died in 2006. Applicant traveled to\nCote D\u2019Ivoire in September 2000 and August 2006. He and his wife traveled to China in\nApril-May 2001.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\nCote d\u2019Ivoire is a developing African nation with a republican government. After\ngaining independence from France in 1960, it has recently experienced political\ninstability and violence, characterized by a successful coup in 1999 and unsuccessful\ncoups in 2001 and 2002. These events have contributed to economic stagnation and\nhigh unemployment, with periodic episodes of violence and civil unrest. The State\nDepartment warns potential travelers of the safety and security concerns of going to\nCote d\u2019Ivoire. Cote d\u2019Ivoire has a poor human rights record, and the level of government\ncorruption is high. It is not a known collector of U.S. information, nor is it known to target\nits expatriate citizens to obtain U.S. U.S.-Ivoirian relations have traditionally been\nfriendly and close.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\n4\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n4\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.5\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. Considering first the country involved, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and the U.S. enjoy\ngood foreign relations. It has not been demonstrated that Cote d\u2019Ivoire government is\nactively engaged in the collection of U.S. intelligence, or that it targets its expatriate\ncitizens such that would make Applicant or his family members likely targets for\ncoercion, duress, or influence.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts with his family\nmembers in Cote d\u2019Ivoire. None of them have any direct connection to the government,\nand Applicant\u2019s contacts with them are so limited that they do not raise a concern over\nprotecting classified information. Further, there is even less reason to be concerned\nabout Applicant\u2019s family members who are resident citizens of the U.S. Finally, I did not\neven discuss the government of the People Republic of China because the government\nfailed to establish that he had any meaningful contact with his in-laws in China, as his\nwife had very little contact with them either. Under these circumstances, I conclude that\nit is unlikely Applicant can be pressured based on his family members in Cote d\u2019Ivoire,\nor his in-laws in China. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\n   Paragraph 1.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n October 28, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn March 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn March 28, 2008, applicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 28, 2008. Applicant did not respond\nto the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 24, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born in Taiwan. In the 1980s, he moved to the United States. He\nbecame a United States citizen in 2000. In 2003, after he became a United States\ncitizen, applicant applied for and received a Taiwanese passport. Although he has never\nused this passport, he still has possession of it.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers, two sisters, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant speaks to his mother once or twice a month.\nHe speaks with his siblings less frequently, but sees them when he visits Taiwan.\nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in at least 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2006.\nThe Government provided seven official United States publications with the\nFORM that describe the political and intelligence activities of Taiwan. The Government\nrequested that these documents be admitted into evidence. I have admitted the\ndocuments into evidence, and I take administrative notice of the following facts found\ntherein:\nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one\nof the most active collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.\nNumerous individuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or\nprosecuted for illegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United\nStates technology to Taiwan. One United States official was recently convicted of\ncrimes related to his improper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\n\n3\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant has at least monthly contact with his mother, and less frequent but\nregular contact with his four siblings, all of whom are citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nIn addition, since becoming a United States citizen, he has visited Taiwan at least four\n\n4\ntimes. Applicant\u2019s presence in Taiwan during these trips made him and his family\nmembers potentially vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the Taiwanese\ngovernment. These facts raise concerns under all three disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s contacts\nwith his mother and siblings in Taiwan are frequent and ongoing. His relationship with\nthem is one of affection and obligation, raising the concern that these relationships\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant failed to provide sufficient\ncredible evidence that it is unlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign government and the interests of the United States, or\nthat he is not vulnerable to a conflict of interest.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10 a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nApplicant applied for and received a Taiwanese passport after becoming a United\nStates citizen. Accordingly, this disqualifying condition applies.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. Under Paragraph 11.c.,\nit may be mitigating if the \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\n\n5\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual\nwas a minor.\u201d Applicant applied for and received a Taiwanese passport after he became\na United States citizen. This mitigating condition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2.a:\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c., the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and four siblings are citizens and residents of Taiwan. He has\nstrong ties to them as evidenced by his regular contact with them and the voluntary trips\nhe made to Taiwan to visit them. His strong familial ties and his voluntary trips to\nTaiwan, a country that actively seeks to acquire sensitive U.S. information and\ntechnology, could leave him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure and could\ncause the future compromise of classified information. \nI have carefully reviewed the administrative record, applicant*s submissions, and\nthe allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C, and I have evaluated applicant*s conduct in light of the whole\nperson concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing\nso, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under Guidelines B\nand C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\n\n6\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) regarding\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant submitted answers to the allegations, dated\nJune 2, 2008. He admitted all allegations, but requested a hearing to explain his\nadmissions and raise mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s request for a hearing was\nreceived on June 30, 2008, and I was assigned the case on July 10, 2008. Applicant\nand Department Counsel proposed a hearing date of August 14, 2008. A notice of\nhearing was issued on July 17, 2008, setting the hearing for that date. \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n In commenting on its nexus to the subsequent alcohol-driving charges, Department Counsel described the\n1\nincident as \u201cfar in the rearview mirror at this point.\u201d Tr. 54.\n Tr. 12.\n2\n Tr. 39.\n3\n Tr. 54.\n4\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered four exhibits,\nwhich were accepted into the record as exhibits (Exs.) 1-4 without objection. Applicant\nrepresented himself and gave testimony; no witnesses were called. He offered nine\nexhibits, which were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A-I. The record\nwas held open through August 29, 2008, to afford Applicant the opportunity to\nsupplement the record. A package of two documents, dated August 26, 2008, was sent\nby facsimile transmission by Applicant. It was received on August 27, 2008. On\nSeptember 2, 2008, the Government expressed its lack of objection to the proffered\ndocuments. They were accepted into the record as Exs. J-K. A copy of the transcript\n(Tr.) was received on September 2, 2008. The record closed on September 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old senior mechanic for a defense contractor. He has an\nAssociate of Arts degree and several professional certifications. Applicant retired from\nthe United States Naval Reserves after 22 years of service. He has two teenage sons,\ncurrently aged 17 and 18. He is legally separated from his wife and pursuing a divorce. \nIn 1987, early in his career and in his mid-20s, Applicant was charged with\nDriving Under the Influence and Failure to Use Designated Lanes. He pled guilty to the\ncharge. He was sentenced to six months probation, 50 hours of community service, and\nhad his driver\u2019s license revoked for six months.1\nApplicant subsequently married. The marriage was volatile, but it produced two\nchildren. He balanced his home life with his United States Naval Reserves duties.\nApplicant traveled alot as a reservist. By the end of his service, it was not unusual for\nhim to be on travel two to three weekends a month.  Consequently, family time with his\n2\nsons was a dear commodity. On April 4, 1993, Applicant came home to help his wife\nprepare for their eldest boy\u2019s birthday. A squabble ensued regarding a gift or a card for\ntheir young son. Applicant\u2019s wife would not drop the matter and pursued it. Finally,\nApplicant told her, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. . . . I\u2019m getting away from you and going outside.\u201d3\nHe left the house and opened the hood of her car to start working on it. She followed\nhim, screaming and swearing. Demonstrating some \u201cfairly foolish\u201d behavior, he gave\nher a kick to her backside end and told him they would continue the discussion in the\nkitchen after things cooled down.  She walked into the house and called the police. The\n4\npolice quickly arrived. When advised he could be charged with a city ordinance\nviolation, Applicant\u2019s wife chose not to press charges. The policeman, however, cited\nhim for Battery. Applicant was found guilty of Battery and sentenced to a $100 fine. \n\n Tr.36.\n5\n Tr. 37.\n6\n Ex. A (Circuit/County Court, Criminal Division, Verdict Form); Tr. 33-35.\n7\n Tr. 42-43.\n8\n3\nOn or about July 20, 2005, Applicant came home early to help his family have a\nbackyard barbeque by the family pool. As he was preparing steaks for the grill and\ndrinking a second beer, his wife announced they were out of barbeque sauce. Applicant\nleft the steaks and proceeded to drive to the base to get barbeque sauce, never\nthinking the beer he consumed could put him near the legal limit for alcohol.  In a rush\n5\nto get back to the steaks, Applicant exceeded the posted speed limit. He was pulled\nover by the police. The policemen thought Applicant was trying to elude him by pulling\nin near the base. Applicant explained that he had been enjoying a family barbeque,\ndrinking a beer, and working the grill, when he was told there was no barbeque sauce,\nConsequently, he explained, he had been in a rush to get back to the grill. Applicant\nwas charged with Speeding and Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, a\nmisdemeanor. At trial, however, the policemen recommended to the court that the\ncharge be dropped down to Reckless Driving.  Applicant was found guilty of speeding\n6\nand Reckless Driving.\nThe following year, on or about July 1, 2006, Applicant prepared to go with his\nteenage sons to visit his father and brother. The plan was to pull his 18-foot fishing boat\nacross the state so the men could go on a fishing trip. The night before the drive across\ntheir state, they had some friends over for a barbeque and beer. The day of the trip,\nApplicant came home from work early, around 11:00 a.m. While he cleaned and\nprepared the craft, he had a couple of beers. Later that day, Applicant and his sons\nmade the six hour drive across state. Once they got to the right city, however, they got\nlost finding Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s home. Driving about with a large boat in tow was\ndifficult and required special maneuvering. The challenge was made more difficult\nbecause it was after midnight and all three were tired. They pulled over. An exhausted\nApplicant called his brother. Sometime after 1:00 a.m., Applicant\u2019s brother found them\nand led them to the residential area where he lived. They towed the boat toward the\nbrother\u2019s apartment complex, but were pulled over by the police before parking.\nApplicant was ultimately charged with Driving or Being in Actual Physical Control of a\nMotor Vehicle While Under the Influence of an Alcoholic Beverage. The case was sent\nto the jury, which found Applicant not guilty on April 19, 2007.  \n7\nAlthough Applicant was not concerned about his drinking, he was concerned\nabout the incident. His honesty in admitting he had consumed some beer the night\nbefore and one or two beers around lunchtime of that same day, over 12 hours prior,\nhad given the wrong impression. After the fishing trip incident, he limited his alcohol\nconsumption to a once a week event.  \n8\nAfter Applicant retired as a reservist, he was able to spend more time at home.\nHe discovered things about his family that he considered highly unacceptable.\n\n Ex. C (Civil Action File, filed April 25, 2008) at 1.\n9\nEx. K (Court transcript, page 30) at 2. \n10\n The police incident report notes that both parties had consumed alcohol, as opposed to drugs, but nothing\n11\nin the report notes behavior traits or other notations indicating whether this consumption was excessive.

It\u2019s a wonder it wasn\u2019t\na fatal wound.\u201d Tr. 55-56..\n Id.\n16\n Id.\n17\n Tr. 18.\n18\n Tr. 14.\n19\n Tr. 40.\n20\n4\nPreviously unbeknownst to him, alcohol and marijuana were freely abused in the home.\nHis wife condoned, if not encouraged the teenagers\u2019 cultivation of marijuana in the\nhome.  She drank to excess. His discovery of such conduct led to marital\n9\ndisagreements that culminated on November 25, 2007. \nAfter leaving the home in her car for a prolonged period of time, supposedly to\ndo some light shopping, Applicant\u2019s wife returned home with an open bottle of vodka in\nthe car.  Applicant thought she was inebriated.  She denied it. An argument ensued\n10\n11\nand grew heated. Applicant told her he was through living with the alcohol and the\ndrugs in the house. He went to the porch to smoke a cigarette, stating \u201cI\u2019m finished,\nwe\u2019re done.\u201d  Applicant, who is 5'10\" and 150 pounds, was standing on the porch when\n12\nhe found himself stabbed in the back by his 5' and 96 pound wife with an 8\" filet knife.13\nApplicant made it to the living room and called 911. While on the phone, his wife pulled\nthe knife out of his back and threw it out onto the porch.  When the police arrived,\n14\nApplicant was \u201cbleeding profusely\u201d from a stab which produced a \u201csevere injury.\u201d  His\n15\nwife told the police that he had attacked her and she had stabbed him to get him off of\nher.  She said she did not know where the weapon was, but it was found on the back\n16\nporch between a wall and a table.  Applicant was rushed to a local trauma center for\n17\ntreatment. He was ultimately charged with Battery-Simple Battery, Family Violence\n(Misdemeanor) after undergoing surgeryt. He was also put on probation. In the interim,\nhis wife was placed under arrest for Aggravated Assault (Felony) and ultimately spent\nabout 19 days in jail.  The incident ended their marriage.  Applicant filed for divorce.\n18\n19\nHe has not spoken to her since the 2007 stabbing.20\n\n Tr. 20, 25-26.\n21\n Tr. 30-31. \n22\n Tr. 40.\n23\n Tr. 43.\n24\n Id.\n25\n Tr. 44.\n26\n Tr. 37-38.\n27\n Tr. 37 (\u201cThat is a good question. Possibly.\u201d)\n28\n Ex. J (Probation Officer letter, undated) (\u201c[Applicant] has excellent reporting habits and continues to test\n29\nnegative for drug screens.\u201d)\n5\nThe charge against Applicant has never gone to court. He and his wife, however,\nwere legally separated. Custody of the sons and retention of the domicile became an\nissue. Because the boys liked the easier rules controlling life in the mother\u2019s house,\nthey were initially placed with their mother in March 2008. After the family home was\nraided by the police and the three were charged with multiple felonies, including drug\ncharges, Applicant went back to court to gain custody of his sons. He was successful in\nhis action and the sons were removed from their mother\u2019s care in April 2008.  The boys\n21\nare now living in their house with their father. The teens are back in school and\nnormalcy has returned to the family. Applicant is providing the sons with a quiet, orderly\nlife without drugs and alcohol.  Applicant has not had contact with his estranged wife\n22\nsince the day he was stabbed.23\nSince the stabbing and regaining custody of his sons, Applicant has consumed\nminimal alcohol: \u201cvery, very minor. A glass of wine here and there. A beer here and\nthere. And now I\u2019m at the point that its nonexistent.\u201d  As part of his probation in the\n24\npending battery charge, Applicant is to refrain from drinking. He was put on probation in\nFebruary 2008, but he was unaware of that provision until he met with his probation\nofficer in April 2008. At the time of the hearing, he had not consumed alcohol for a\nperiod dating back to around the time of that meeting.  He has passed all alcohol tests\n25\nadministered as part of his probation.  \n26\nThe three instances cited, from 2005/2006 and 1987 are Applicant\u2019s only\nbrushes with the law concerning alcohol; only the 1987 incident led to an alcohol-\nrelated conviction or any related sanction. In the past, Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol has\nnever affected his work or everyday functioning.  He did not regularly drink to excess.\n27\nHe is unsure whether his use of alcohol contributed to his marital problems with his\nestranged wife.  There is no indication Applicant has ever had an issue with illegal\n28\ndrugs.  He is dedicated to being an good example for his sons.\n29\n\n Exhibit I (Personal Portfolio), tab \u201cEvaluations.\u201d\n30\n Tr. 28.\n31\n Ex.

H (Reference, dated August 11, 2008).\n35\n6\nAs an employee, Applicant\u2019s annual ratings routinely place him between the\nequivalent of a 4 and a 5 on a 5 points scale, with 5 being the highest grade available.30\nHe regularly exceeds work requirements and is highly lauded for his work and his work\nethic. Applicant stresses that he has always segregated his professional and personal\nlife, especially in light of the last three years of personal turmoil.  A superior describes\n31\nhim as \u201cvery reliable, dependable . . . and has set a very high standard, not only for\nhimself, but for subordinate employees as well.\u201d  That same superior notes Applicant\u2019s\n32\ndevotion to his sons while stating that despite the recent turmoil with Applicant\u2019s wife,\nApplicant \u201chas still continued to maintain his high work ethic and motivation at the work\nplace.\u201d  One co-worker notes that Applicant is \u201ca hard working individual and one that\n33\ncan be trusted.\u201d  Another co-worker states: \u201c[Applicant] is dependable, reliable,\n34\ntrustworthy, and consistent as a fellow employee. He has also demonstrated . . . to be\n[a] very family oriented individual, with traditional values.\u201d35\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n36\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n37\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n38\n Id.\n39\n Id.\n40\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n41\n7\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n36\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n37\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n38\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n39\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n40\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n41\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) are the most pertinent to the evaluation of the\nfacts in this case:\n\n To the extent the 1993 kick and the 2007 stabbing were both altercations involving the same spouse, it is\n42\nadditionally notable that Applicant and his wife are now legally separated, no longer maintain contact, and are\npoised for divorce.\n8\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. With respect to Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits that he was\ncharged with Battery/Simple Battery-Family Violence in 2007 and is currently on\nprobation for the alleged offense, arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence in 2006, arrested and charged with Speeding and Driving Under the Influence\nin 2005 before being found guilty of Speeding and Reckless Driving, found guilty and\nfined for Battery in 1993, and pled no contest to Driving Under the Influence and Failure\nto Use Designated Lanes in 1987. Such conduct and admissions are sufficient to raise\nsecurity concerns, and invoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 1,\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CC DC 3, AG \u00b6\n31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted).\nThe 1987 no contest plea to the Driving Under the Influence charge preceded\nthe 2005/2006 alcohol-related charges by nearly 20 years and there are no intervening\nincidents. Similarly, there were no instances of battery cited between Applicant\u2019s 1993\nconviction and his 2007 charge, which occurred nearly 15 years later and which has yet\nto be prosecuted. Consequently, the earlier incidents cannot be said to foreshadow\nmore recent events or to establish some on-going pattern of criminal conduct. They\nstand remote and unrelated to more recent conduct.  Therefore, Criminal Conduct\n42\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unsual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) applies. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s stabbing of her husband, removal of\nthe 8\" blade from his back as called 911, and attempt to cover-up her grievous action\nresulted in her being sent directly to jail on a felony charge. In contrast, Applicant\u2019s\nmisdemeanor battery charge has yet to move to trial, if it ever does. In light of the facts\nof record, including Applicant\u2019s soon to be ex-wife\u2019s own contradictory court testimony\nregarding this incident, there is little that can be said to characterize the facts or\ncircumstances as usual or ordinary. Nor are there aspects about the incident that bear\nadversely on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Therefore, AG \u00b6 31(a)\napplies equally to the 2007 stabbing. \nIn 2006, Applicant was cited for Driving Under the Influence. He concedes he\nconsumer alcohol earlier in the day, probably around lunchtime. He then towed a 16-\nfoot fishing boat across state on a six hour drive with two teenage boys. The drive\napparently took much longer than six hours and they did not reach their destination until\nabout 1:00 a.m. Exhausted, he was pulled over. He told the police he had consumed\nalcohol that day. He was arrested for Driving Under the Influence. At trial, however, the\n\n9\njury determined he was not guilty of the alcohol-related criminal conduct cited, giving\nrise to CC MC AG \u00b632(c) (\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\u201d).\nAfter the 2006 Driving Under the Influence charge, Applicant decided it was best\nto limit his drinking of alcohol to once a week. He was already reducing his consumption\nto a negligible amount close to \u201cnonexistent\u201d when abstinence was made part of his\nprobation. Although alcohol has never affected his work or his everyday functioning, he\nis adhering to this rule not just as part of his probation, but as part of his efforts to set\nan example for his sons. At the time of the hearing he had not had a drink in months\nand his own alcohol consumption had not raised any issues in a few years. As for the\nalleged battery in 2007, the facts make it clear that he was the victim. He is remorseful\nthat his marriage ended in such a manner. Through divorce, Applicant is endeavoring to\nnever again be involved with a substance abusing wife, thus removing any potential that\nthey will again have a domestic disagreement. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s superior\nemployment record and work ethic, as well as his relationship with his sons, have not\nbeen impaired or impeded. Today, his main goal is providing a quiet, orderly home life\nfor his sons and a continued, successful career. Together, these factors raise CC MC\nAG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Here, the Government cites to instances in\n2007, 2006, 2005, and 1987 as examples of Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol\nconsumption. \nThe weight of the evidence, combined with Applicant\u2019s highly credible and candid\ntestimony, suggest that while Applicant may have consumed alcohol on the day of the\nNovember 2007 incident, his own consumption did not lead to his stabbing. While the\npolice report notes that both parties had consumed alcohol, it does not depict\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use as excessive or describe his judgment as impaired. Rather, both\nhis testimony and her testimony in another proceeding indicate that he remained\nrational throughout the attack. As for the 2006 incident, in which Applicant concedes he\nhad imbibed moderate alcohol many hours before being pulled over while towing his\nboat, a jury of his peers determined he was not under the influence of alcohol at the\ntime. The evidence regarding how much alcohol may have contributed to Applicant\nbehavior in the 2005 incident is incomplete. The judgment against Applicant in 1987,\nhowever, clearly indicates alcohol consumption was a sufficiently essential element to\nraise concerns. Consequently, those latter two incidents raise Alcohol Consumption\nDisqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d). \n\n W hile the mere fact Applicant got into a car after consuming one beer may be sufficient to raise concerns\n43\nand initiate inquiry, the arresting officer was in the best position to gauge any degree of impairment or ill\njudgment on the part of the Applicant.\n10\nAlthough the 2005 incident does not clearly demonstrate an incident of excessive\nalcohol consumption, Applicant conceded he had consumed beer. As a result, the\npolice charged him with an alcohol-related offense along with speeding. At trial,\nhowever, it was the police officer who, in light of the unique facts, apparently\nreconsidered the situation and questioned whether Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption\nwas sufficiently excessive to merit consideration of the alcohol charge.  As a result, the\n43\nofficer requested the court consider the speeding incident only as a case of reckless\ndriving. Further, the 1987 incident occurred when Applicant was in his 20s, nearly two\ndecades ago. No intervening alcohol-related incidents occurred in the late 1980s,\nthrough the 1990's or the early 2000's. While the circumstances surrounding that\nincident are unexplored, it is hard to conclude that they bear on the Applicant of today.\nGiven these factors, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) AG \u00b6 23(a)\n(\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened in such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt as to the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies. None of the\nother mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a mature, direct, and candid individual with a fine work\nrecord and a notable devotion to his children. As a witness, he was highly credible. He\nopenly acknowledges the friction that existed between himself and his soon to be ex-\nwife and takes responsibility for those times he thoughtlessly drank alcohol and drove a\ncar.\nApplicant\u2019s 1987 Driving Under the Influence conviction was rightly described as\n\u201cfar in the rearview mirror at this point.\u201d Occurring nearly two decades before his next\n\n See Tr. 55.\n44\n11\nsuch citation, it bears no nexus to his subsequent charges. Similarly, the 1993 battery\nwas the result of a foolish argument in which no physical harm was caused and his wife\nwas reluctant to press charges. They would endure nearly 15 years more of\ncohabitation and marriage before their unforseeable and somewhat bizarre November\n2007 incident.\nThe 2005 incident falls somewhere between a misjudgment and bad luck.\nApplicant was unexpectedly told by his wife to go and buy barbeque sauce. He was\nmore than likely pulled over because of his speeding, not for the two beers which could\nsomeone of his slight build adversely.  When pulled over, it was the Applicant who\n44\nvolunteered the fact he had consumed a less than excessive amount of alcohol. That\nconfession, however, required the police to add an alcohol charge to the speeding\ncharge. Notably, however, it was the arresting officer who asked the court to reduce the\npending charge to reckless driving. Later, Appellant was found not guilty by a jury of his\npeers in the 2006 incident. While Applicant may have consumed an alcoholic beverage\nthe day he was stabbed in November 2007, it is his wife\u2019s intoxication that is the most\nnotable. She was the one who returned home with an open bottle of vodka in the car.\nHer actions precipitated the argument. She tried to mislead the police with regard to the\nincident and the location of the weapon. Meanwhile, the facts indicate that he remained\nrational throughout the nearly fatal ordeal. In short, Applicant experienced a difficult\nthree-year period in his life, some of which was born out of his relationship with his wife.\nShe is no longer in his home and a divorce is pending.\nApplicant denied that alcohol has affected his work or his everyday routine. He\ndeclined, however, to deny its had any effect on his marriage. By leaving the door open\nas to whether alcohol affected his marriage, Applicant demonstrated a superior level of\ncandor which is very much to his credit. \nIt is unclear whether the 2007 battery misdemeanor will proceed to court, but\nApplicant remains under probation. Generally, probation is a signal to this process that\nthe Government, too, should have reservations about Applicant. Here, his probation\nofficer reports that Applicant has excellent reporting habits and continues to test\nnegative for drug screens, has completed required evaluations, and is current on all\nfees and payments. Applicant reports that he is successfully maintaining abstinence as\npart of his probation and in his efforts to set a better example for his sons. Indeed, it is\nclear that Applicant will comply with most any restrictions for the opportunity to continue\nhis care for his sons and to help guide them into manhood. Both probation and his\nmarital separation certainly provide Applicant with an opportunity to turn his life around.\nThe weight of the evidence shows he is taking advantage of that opportunity.\nFinally, the ultimate issue is whether it is in the best interests of the nation to\nfurther entrust Applicant with classified information. Applicant has noted that he is\ndevoted to his work and that he has successfully segregated his professional life from\nhis personal turmoil. He has even stressed that alcohol has never affected his work\nperformance. His co-workers and evaluations wrote highly of his ability to execute his\n\n12\nwork duties and his work ethic; one co-worker explicitly noted that neither Applicant\u2019s\nwork nor work ethic suffered despite recent events. The whole person considerations in\nthis case are particularly compelling. Applicant has mitigated security concerns\nregarding his suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that it is clearly consistent\nwith national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b but denies the allegation in \u00b6 1.d. He claims it is a duplicate of 1.b. Applicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed as a training professional with the defense contractor since February 2001. Prior to that, he served on active duty in the United States Army. He retired as an E-8. He is married and has two children, a daughter, age 26, and a son, age 24. (Tr at 7-9, 72; Gov 1; AE U.)

On February 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 19, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to be proceed on April \n16, 2008. The case was assigned to me on April 21, 2008. On May 5, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for May 28, 2008. The case was heard on \nthat date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant offered 23 exhibits which were admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 W. Applicant and his wife, who also served as his personal \nJuly 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrepresentative testified.  The record was held open until June 18, 2008, to allow \nApplicant to submit additional evidence.  Applicant timely submitted a fifteen-page \ndocument which was admitted as AE X and a three-page document which is admitted \nas AE Y. The transcript was received on June 5, 2008.  Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing within 15 days as required by \u00b6 \nE3.1.8 of the Directive.  He waived the 15 day advance notice. (Tr at 16.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b but denies the allegation in \u00b6 1.d. He claims it is a duplicate of \n1.b.  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a training professional with the \ndefense contractor since February 2001. Prior to that, he served on active duty in the \nUnited States Army. He retired as an E-8. He is married and has two children, a \ndaughter, age 26, and a son, age 24. (Tr at 7-9, 72; Gov 1; AE U.)  \n \nOn September 12, 2006, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to question 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d he answered \u201cNo.\u201d He also \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(b) \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent \non any debt(s)?\u201d (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:  a $16,300 line of credit that was 180 days delinquent in March \n2006 and subsequently charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Gov 2 at 3,10, 16; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at \n6); a $1,041 medical account placed for collection in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 2 at 4-\n5, 18-19; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 11); a $7,347 credit card account charged off in          \nJanuary 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 2 at 4, 10; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 6); a $2,828 \nmedical account placed for collection in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Gov 2 at 4-5, 18-19; \nGov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 12); and a $4,625 credit card account placed for collection in                    \nSeptember 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 2 at 5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 17; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 2).   \n \nApplicant and his wife first encountered significant financial problems in June \n2005 when his wife was fired from her job after 12 years of employment. She was \nunemployed for approximately two months. Their income was reduced by $2,000 a \nmonth. In addition, approximately $3,000 was spent on attorney fees related to issues \ndealing with his wife\u2019s termination. They decided to stop fighting the issue when they \ncould no longer afford attorney fees. (Tr at 46-54.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife had knee surgery in the summer of 2005. In August 2005, she \naccepted a one year temporary job. Her job ended in August 2006. She was \nunemployed from August until December 2006. She has been employed full-time with \nthe same company since December 2006. (Tr at 51-54.) \n  \nApplicant and his wife first attempted to resolve their debts in April 2006, when \nthey entered into a contract with a debt settlement company. Under the terms of the \nagreement, they paid the company $357.07 per month for the first three months and \nthen were required to pay 14 additional monthly payments of $173.90 per month.  After \nseveral months, they discovered that even though they were making payments to the \ncompany, the company was not resolving their accounts and was not responsive. They \nstopped working with the company around December 2006. They paid the company \n$1,940.71 and none of the accounts were resolved. In June 2007, Applicant and his \nwife started contacting creditors individually. (Tr at 56-60; AE W; AE X at 5-6.)      \n \nApproximately two years ago, Applicant\u2019s family suffered a tragedy when his son-\nin-law\u2019s 21-year-old brother drowned after his canoe tipped over on a fishing trip.  One \nmonth later, his son-in-law\u2019s father died unexpectedly.  (Tr at 74.)   \n \nThe current status of the delinquent debts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: $16,300 line of credit. The money was used for his daughter\u2019s \nwedding ($13,000) and for his wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees ($3,000). On May 8, 2008, \nApplicant entered into an agreement with the collection agency to pay $130 per month \nfor six months with the first payment due in June 2008. In November 2008, the \npayments will increase to $600 per month. Applicant paid the first payment in June. (Tr \nat 26-27, 45-46; AE I; AE X at 2; AE Y at 3.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $1,041 medical account turned over for collection. This debt involved \nexpenses related to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s knee surgery. The account was paid through a \ngarnishment of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s wages. Tri-Care settled this claim but Applicant and \nhis wife paid it anyway. Applicant claims the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the same \ndebt. The two accounts were merged into one account. However, there is no \ndocumentary evidence supporting this assertion. (Tr at 34-35, 55,6; AE C; AE E; AE H \nat 2; AE K; AE M; AE S; Gov 2 at 19.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $7,347 credit card account charged off.  The balance of this credit \ncard account related to charges incurred in January 2001 when Applicant\u2019s father \npassed away.  Before his death, he flew home and took care of his mother who is \ndisabled from a stroke. When his father passed away, he charged plane tickets to fly his \nfamily to attend the funeral. In April 2008, Applicant agreed to a settlement of $4,666. \nHe pays $691.07 monthly. He anticipates the account will be paid in six months. Proof \nof payments in April and June were provided. (Tr at 41, 63-65; AE C; AE H at 2; AE K; \nAE X at 3; AE Y at 2.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  $2,828 medical account. This relates to expenses from Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s knee surgery. Applicant claims this debt was combined with the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. It was paid in full through a garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s wages. Tri-\nCare settled the claim. The account number on the Tri-Care letter matches the account \nnumber for the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. As such, Applicant did not owe for \nthis medical debt. Since there is documentary evidence supporting the two medical \naccounts were combined, it is likely that the other medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was paid \nthrough garnishment. (Tr at 34-35, 62; AE E; AE H at 2; AE M; AE S.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $4,625 delinquent credit card account placed for collection. On March \n27, 2008, Applicant agreed to settle this debt in the amount of $2,565. He agreed to pay \n$50 per month. Once the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is paid, he will increase his monthly \npayments. He submitted proof of a payment made in May which indicates the balance \nhas been reduced. A reasonable assumption can be made that multiple payments were \nmade towards this account. (Tr at 41-42; AE B; AE H at 2; AE J; Gov 2 at 13.)   \n \nApplicant had to delay resolving some of these accounts due to unexpected car \nrepairs in March 2008 and May 2008.  The car repair bill in March 2008 was for $423. \nThe car repair bill in May 2008 was for $1,172. (Tr at 36; AE T; AE X at 4.) Applicant \nresolved and or brought current several accounts not alleged in the SOR.  He paid a \n$249 account. (Gov 2 at 2.) A credit card with a $1,061 balance now has a $700 \nbalance. A $47 automatic deduction is applied to this account. (Tr at 41; Gov 2 at 7, 20;  \nAE D; AE L.)  An account with an original balance of $1,033.96 was paid off. (Gov 2 at \n8, 14; AE F) A $268.95 medical account was paid off. (Tr at 41; AE G.) Applicant and \nhis wife extended the terms of their mortgage to bring the account current. They fell \nbehind a month during his wife\u2019s unemployment. (Tr at 33-34, 44; AE R.)                                              \n \nAfter Applicant retired, he encountered some tax issues, he began his current job \nfor several months while on terminal leave from the military. The extra income created a \ntax debt.  His wages were garnished in 2005 and 2006 by the federal government. He \nowed a total of $5,000 over two to three tax years and about $500 to the state. He is \nfinally current on his taxes.  He has not received his tax stimulus check yet. He intends \nto apply $500 of the tax stimulus check to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and use any \nremaining money to pay off his lower credit card accounts. (Tr at 79-82.) \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant was promoted and received a raise. (Tr at 18; AE P.) \nAside from the accounts previously discussed, Applicant and his wife have two open \ncredit card accounts. Both have a $300 limit. Both balances are between $200 to $300. \nApplicant pays $75 towards each account. (Tr at 77.) Applicant has not attended \nfinancial counseling but found a budget program on the internet which helps him keep \ntrack of his expenses. He and his wife earn a total net monthly income of $4,919. This  \nincludes his military retirement check. Their total monthly expenses, including debt \npayments, are $4,109. They have approximately $810 left over each month after \nexpenses.  Applicant\u2019s income will increase further with his recent raise. (Tr at 76; AE \nV.)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant admits that he made a bad decision by not disclosing his debts on the \nfinancial section of his e-QIP application.  He did not have current information on his \ndebts and he did not list that he had delinquent debts because he did not want to be \nembarrassed. He regrets his omission and has learned that he should always be truthful \nand honest. He intends to be truthful and honest in the future. (Tr at 40, 90-94.)  \n \nDuring his Army service, Applicant held a security clearance. He deployed to \nDesert Storm in 1991 and to Cuba. (Tr at 83-84.) His awards include the Meritorious \nService Medal (3rd Award); Army Commendation Medal (7th Award); Army Achievement \nMedal (2nd Award); Army Good Conduct Medal (6th Award); National Defense Service \nMedal; Southwest Asia Service Medal with One Bronze Service Star; Noncommissioned \nOfficer\u2019s Professional Development Ribbon with Numeral 3; and the Army Service \nRibbon. (AE U.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor states that Applicant has worked for him for seven years. \nHe works with him daily and describes Applicant as a solid employee exceeding the \nrequirements and expectation of his job. He finds him trustworthy. (AE N.)  The Site \nLead states that he hired Applicant based on his knowledge and experience as a First \nSergeant in combat infantry unit. He notes that Applicant is a vital team member. His \nknowledge supersedes his co-workers. He finds him trustworthy.  He is aware that \nApplicant made a serious mistake when re-applying for his security clearance and \nacknowledges that it was not the right thing to do but believes Applicant deserves a \nsecond chance. (AE O.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations since 2005.  The SOR reveals five delinquent accounts with a total \napproximate balance of $32,141.    \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility is too recent to apply this mitigating \ncondition. Although Applicant resolved several debts and has entered into payment \nagreements pertaining to his remaining debts, his financial issues remain current.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant\u2019s wife encountered two \nperiods of unemployment which placed a burden on the family finances. One of the \ncredit card balances was increased due to the purchase of plane tickets for Applicant \nand his family to attend his father\u2019s funeral. Applicant first attempted to resolve his \ndelinquent debts by signing a contract with a debt settlement company. The company \ntook $1,940 of Applicant\u2019s money but did not resolve any of his accounts. Unforeseen \ncar repairs also delayed the resolution of some of the accounts. Applicant should not be \npenalized for these events which prevented him from resolving his debts sooner. He \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply with respect to counseling because Applicant has not attended \nfinancial counseling. However, the medical accounts are resolved and he entered into \nrepayment plans with his three remaining creditors. If Applicant follows the terms of his \nrepayment agreements, his delinquent accounts will be resolved. His budget indicates \nthat he has sufficient income to meet the terms of the repayment agreements and pay \nhis other bills. In fact, he has approximately $800 left over each month. With his recent \nraise and his wife being employed full-time, his financial situation has stabilized.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. The medical accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b. and 1.d are resolved. Applicant entered into repayment agreements with the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e.  Although these repayment agreements are \nrecent, Applicant attempted to resolve these debts in April 2006. Unfortunately, he \nretained the services of a debt settlement company that took his money but did little to \nassist in resolving his delinquent accounts. He should not be penalized for the delay in \nentering into repayment agreements. It is noted that he faithfully made payments to the \ndebt resolution company under the terms of the contract.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent debts in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his e-QIP application. The \nfollowing Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) applies to this allegation. Applicant admits that he deliberately did not \ndisclose his delinquent accounts on his e-QIP application.  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging is any activity that is \nillegal in that country or is that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group) applies because Applicant admits that he did not list his debts on \nthe e-QIP application out of embarrassment. The concealment of his debts made him \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns can be mitigated.  The following Personal Conduct \nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) applies.  While a deliberate falsification of an e-QIP application is \nserious, there is no record of other instances of similar conduct in Applicant\u2019s past. He \nwas straightforward in disclosing his financial problems during his subsequent \nbackground investigation and at hearing.  The fact that he admitted that he deliberately \nomitted his delinquent debts rather than making up excuses indicates a strength of \ncharacter.  For these reasons, as well as the whole person factors, this one-time \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndeliberate omission does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) applies for the same \nreasons. Applicant\u2019s admission that he did not list his delinquent debts on his e-QIP \napplication and his subsequent full disclosure of his financial situation during his \nbackground investigation alleviate the concerns raised by his deliberate omission. \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies because the Applicant has \nfully disclosed his financial problems. No issue remains that makes him vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nFor these reasons, Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under \npersonal conduct. \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s efforts to \nresolve his accounts, the favorable references of his superiors, and his twenty years of \nactive duty service in the United States Army.  I considered Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation was adversely affected by his wife\u2019s two periods of unemployment. While a \ndeliberate omission on a security clearance application is serious, Applicant\u2019s  \nacceptance of full responsibility for omitting his debts on his e-QIP application without \nexcuses reflects favorably on his character. Aside from the omission, he has fully \ncooperated in providing the details of his financial situation. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is granted.\nOn December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 27, 2008, admitted the allegation,\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 5, 2009. On March\n16, 2009, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the case for April 8, 2009. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. I received three government exhibits and 17\nApril 24, 2009\n\nApplicant referred to them as \u201crunners\u201d (Tr. 77).\n1\n2\nApplicant exhibits. Also, I received the testimony of Applicant and five Applicant\nwitnesses. The transcript was received on April 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old single man with one daughter, age 19. He lives with his\ngirlfriend, the mother of their daughter. He has a high school diploma. Currently, he\nperforms electrical work for a defense contractor (Tr. 63).\nApplicant is from a middle-class, two-parent home. He was a good student in\nhigh school. After graduating, he completed a three-year culinary school. By\napproximately 1992, he was working at an elite restaurant (Tr. 40, 59, 69).\nShortly thereafter, Applicant \u201cgot with the wrong crowd,\u201d a group of friends from\nhigh school who were dealing drugs (Id.). He was 22 years old at the time. Upon\nnoticing their flashy lifestyles, he concluded that drug dealing could provide an\nopportunity to make significant part-time income (Tr. 74). \nApplicant, with his friends\u2019 assistance, then began dealing marijuana. Later, he\nbegan dealing cocaine (Tr. 75). By approximately 1994, he was making up to $1000 per\nweek as part of a cocaine-dealing network, and supervised two people (Tr. 77).1\nIn November 1995, federal authorities arrested Applicant, and charged him with\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine base, possession with intent to distribute cocaine base,\nand distribution of cocaine base. He did not make bond, and remained incarcerated until\nhis trial in February 1996 (Tr. 82; Exhibit 3 at 1). At trial, he pleaded guilty to Count 1,\nand was sentenced to 14 years in prison (Answer). After cooperating with the\ngovernment by disclosing the identities of other people involved in the drug dealing\nnetwork, Applicant\u2019s sentence was reduced to eight years (Tr. 84).\nApplicant was released after serving six years of the sentence. He spent the first\nthree years of the sentence residing with the general prison population (Tr. 91).\nBecause he was a model prisoner, he spent the second half of his sentence residing in\na prison camp (Tr. 92). While there, he spent each day performing custodial work\noutside of the prison in civilian buildings with minimal supervision (Tr. 92). \nAfter Applicant\u2019s release from prison in April 2002, the court placed him on five\nyears of probation (Tr. 85). He was required to report to a probation officer monthly,\nsubmit to random urinalyses, get a job, and provide copies of pay stubs to the probation\nofficer at each meeting (Tr. 87). \nApplicant complied with his probation requirements as ordered, and it ended in\n2007 (Tr. 85) Toward the end of probation, the probation officer told him that he no\n\n3\nlonger needed to meet with him, and instructed him simply to report to the office\nmonthly, and slide the pay stubs under his door (Id.).\nApplicant was deeply remorseful about his decision to sell drugs. Shortly after his\nincarceration, he told his father that he had \u201clet [him] down\u201d (Tr. 39 - Father\u2019s\nTestimony). He devoted his prison time to rehabilitation by reading extensively and\ntaking business, real estate, and physical fitness courses. Also, he became a nationally\ncertified personal fitness trainer (Tr. 88). \nApplicant remained in close contact with his family throughout his incarceration.\nSpecifically, his brother, a teen during Applicant\u2019s arrest, testified that Applicant\nrepeatedly advised him to make education his top priority, not to \u201cfollow the wrong path,\u201d\nand to learn how to invest wisely (Tr. 25). Applicant\u2019s brother subsequently finished\ncollege with a degree in mechanical engineering. He and his wife have designated\nApplicant to be the legal guardian of their child in the event of their deaths (Exhibit O).\nApplicant and his girlfriend remained together during his incarceration. She and\ntheir daughter relocated to Applicant\u2019s parent\u2019s home after his incarceration. According\nto his girlfriend, he focused on their daughter during his incarceration to ensure that she\n\u201cwas going in the right direction\u201d (Tr. 42). He remained closely involved with everyday\nactivities, helping his daughter with homework by phone, and mailing her practice math\nquestions, that she would complete, and return to him (Tr. 44, 101). Upon his release,\nApplicant continued to be highly involved in his daughter\u2019s life, helping her with various\nextracurricular activities. Currently, his daughter is attending college, with a combination\nof financial assistance from her parents, grants, and student loans.\nShortly after Applicant was released from prison, his mother was stricken with\nbreast cancer. For two years while she was incapacitated by chemotherapy treatments,\nhe assisted in caring for her, cleaning the home, helping her up the stairs, and cooking\nfor her, each day after work (Tr. 35). Her cancer has been in remission for\napproximately five years. \nApplicant is active in breast cancer charities, participating in annual fundraisers\nand walkathons (Tr. 106). He periodically volunteers at a local church, delivering food to\nits food bank (Tr. 99).\nApplicant has worked continuously since his incarceration. He has worked with\nhis current employer for the past 18 months. During this time, he has earned multiple\njob-related certifications after successfully completing training in several areas including\nprotecting classified information (Exhibits B, C), and information technology (Exhibit K).\nAccording to his supervisor, he is a good team player who is exceptionally self-\nmotivated (Exhibits M-N).\nApplicant spends his free time with his family. He no longer associates with the\npeople with whom he dealt drugs in the early 1990s. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s three-years of drug dealing in the early 1990s, his subsequent arrest,\nand conviction trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d Applicant served six years in prison where he was a model prisoner. He\nsuccessfully fulfilled his probation requirements. He has not violated the law since going\nto prison 13 years ago. Since being released, he has continuously held employment,\nand is well-respected on the job. While in prison, he took several courses, and earned a\nfitness training certification. He has earned several certifications since working at his\ncurrent job. He is active in his community participating in annual breast cancer\nawareness fundraisers, and occasionally volunteering at a local church\u2019s food bank.\n\n5\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and,\n32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement,\u201d apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant was not a low level drug dealer; he was part of a crime network with\ntwo people working underneath him. The severity of the prison sentence further reflects\nthe seriousness of the crime.\nNeither Applicant\u2019s age nor social background mitigate the crime. He is from a\nsolid, middle-class, two-parent home. When he began dealing drugs, he had already\nfinished high school, completed a vocational school, and was maintaining a steady job.\nHe made a calculated decision to augment his income through illegal means regardless\nof the moral and societal consequences.\nNevertheless, the presence of rehabilitation is extraordinary. Upon entering\nprison, he dedicated himself to self-improvement, taking whatever courses interested\nhim and were available. Realizing the profound mistaken judgment he demonstrated in\nchoosing to deal drugs, he mentored his younger brother not to make the same\nmistake. He maintained a close relationship with his daughter, who was approximately\nfive years old when he first entered prison, and twelve when he was released. Her\ntestimony regarding his influence on her life was particularly persuasive.\nCurrently, Applicant spends his time working, where he excels, socializing with\nhis family, and volunteering, on occasion, in the community. He has not associated with\nany of the individuals involved in the criminal enterprise since he was arrested nearly 15\nyears ago.\nThe seriousness of the crime is outweighed by its remoteness, and the presence\nof rehabilitation, rendering the likelihood of recurrence minimal. Upon considering the\n\n6\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions together with the whole person concept, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern. Clearance is\ngranted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant is a Syrian born, naturalized U.S. citizen, who has lived in the United \nStates since 1998. Applicant\u2019s sisters are dual Lebanese and Canadian citizens residing \nin Lebanon, his brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in Lebanon, and his step-\nson is a dual U.S and Egyptian citizen living in Egypt. Applicant\u2019s wife and two children \nare U.S. citizens living in the U.S. He has more connections to the United States than to \nLebanon. Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nAugust 13, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 5, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence.  \n  \n \nOn April 4, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated May 9, 2008. Six documents (Items 1-6) were \npart of the FORM. Applicant was sent a copy of the FORM, along with notice of his \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \npotentially disqualifying conditions. Applicant's response to the FORM was due on June \n15, 2008, 30 days after receipt of a copy of the FORM. As of July 7, 2008, no response \nhad been received. On July 7, 2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Lebanon and Egypt. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as Items I\u2500XXIII. Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that the facts \nadministratively noticed must be limited to matters of general knowledge and matters \nnot subject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations, with \nexplanation. Applicant is a 58-year-old linguist working for a defense contractor working \nwith the U.S. Army since December 2005. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nFrom January 2006 to January 2007, Applicant worked as a linguist in Iraq. (Item 5) As \nan Arabic linguist, he works with the joint coalition in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s former \npalaces in the \u201cgreen zone\u201d providing information to the U.S. Army and the Iraqi \nNational Police. In February 2007, he was scheduled to return to Iraq for another year. \nThe record is silent as to his return.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Syria, but was never a citizen of Syria. (Item 5) His parents \nwere citizens of Lebanon and of Lebanese heritage. His father was a dual citizen of \nLebanon and Canada. (Item 5) In 1956, when Applicant was six years old, his family \nmoved from Syria to Lebanon. (Item 6) He does not remember being in Syria. Applicant \nreceived his high school education and his bachelor\u2019s degree in hotel management in \nLebanon. During the Lebanese civil war, which lasted from 1975 to 1990, Applicant was \nliving in a Christian area of Beirut and had to cross into a Muslim area to get to his job at \nthe airport. In 1985, he was walking with his wife when attacked. His attackers \nthreatened to beat and behead him. (Item 5) Applicant decided it was time to leave \nLebanon. In 1989, he obtained his \u201cgreen card.\u201d \n \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n \nIn July 1995, he became a U.S. citizen. As a U.S. citizen, Applicant states his \nloyalty and allegiance are to the U.S. and has no foreign preference. (Items 2 and 5) \nApplicant and his wife gave up their expired Lebanese passports. They are unable to \nrevoke their Lebanese National Identification cards. The cards identify which directorate \nor tribal area of Lebanon Applicant came from. Applicant has no obligation to the \nLebanese government. (Item 5) He has no financial or business ties outside the U.S.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Egypt and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July \n1995. In April 1976, Applicant and his wife were married. They have two children born in \nLebanon, a daughter born in 1978 and a son born in December 1979. Both became \nU.S. citizens in July 1995.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s step-son was born in Egypt in 1970 and educated as a sound \nengineer in the U.S. His step-son is a dual citizen of Egypt and the U.S. His step-son \nlives in Egypt, is married, and has two children. In 2006, Applicant and his wife spent \ntwo weeks in Egypt visiting his step-son. In 2004, Applicant and his wife visited his step-\nson in Egypt for one week.  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen living in Lebanon. He received his \nU.S. citizenship in April 1996 and is married to an Italian. Applicant has contact with his \nbrother every two or three months. Applicant has a sister living in California who \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1999. Applicant has two sisters living in Lebanon who are dual \ncitizens of Lebanon and Canada. He has contact with them every three or four months. \nOne of his sisters was caring for Applicant\u2019s elderly parents before they died in 2004. \nOne sister and her husband own a civil engineering business. \n  \n \n \nWhen his parents were alive, Applicant periodically traveled to Lebanon to see \nthem. He has not traveled to Lebanon since 2004. He states he has no reason to go to \nLebanon. Applicant was unable to attend his parent\u2019s funeral because he was in Iraq \nworking as an Arabic linguist for the U.S. Army at the time and travel to Lebanon was \nprohibited. When his parents were alive, Applicant traveled to Lebanon in 2001, 2003, \nand 2004.  \n \nLebanon \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Lebanon is a nominal \ndemocracy with a less-than-perfect human rights record. It has both a long history of \ncivil war and of foreign influence by Syria. Lebanon is not a state sponsor of terrorism, \nbut is a permissive environment for groups recognized by the U.S. as terrorist \norganizations, which Lebanon considers \"freedom fighters\" against Israel. The U.S. \nState Department continues to maintain a travel warning for U.S. citizens contemplating \ntravel to Lebanon. Lebanon is not known to be a collector of intelligence or economic \ninformation against the U.S.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nEgypt \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Egypt is a republic with a strong \nexecutive. The United States and Egypt enjoy a strong and friendly relationship based \non shared mutual interests in Middle East peace and stability, strengthening trade \nrelations, and promoting regional security.2 The threat of terrorism in Egypt remains \nhigh and transnational terrorist groups and local terrorist groups pose threats in Egypt \ndespite Egypt\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists and \u201cZero tolerance\u201d policy on \nextremism.3 In 2003, Egypt discovered and disrupted a terrorist plot against U.S. \ninterests.4 Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt suffered a series of deadly, coordinated \nterrorist bombings, which cause many deaths and hundreds of injuries, including U.S. \ncitizens.5 \u201cAlthough the Egyptian government took measures against the perpetrators of \nthe 2004 and 2005 attacks, a 2006 bombing reflects a persistent, indigenous threat of \nterror activities.6 \n \nTerrorists use overt, covert, and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine \nU.S. national security interests. Terrorist organizations currently target the U.S. for \nintelligence collection through human espionage and other means.7 Terrorist groups \nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.  \n \nThe State Department notes the Egypt\u2019s human rights record is poor and serious \nabuses continue in many areas. Problems include: restriction of freedom of speech, \npress, assembly, and association, denial of fair trial, lack of due process, limitations on \nthe right of citizens to change their government, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, \npoor prison conditions, political prisoners and detainees, torture, as well as executive \nbranch limitation on an independent judiciary. Torture in Egyptian detention centers is \npervasive.8  \n \nOpposition parties continue to lodge credible complaints about election \nmanipulation by the government even though recent elections were more transparent \n \n2 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Egypt, March 2008.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Id. \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the \nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens \nto obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG & 6 \n \nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions. Conditions \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying are listed under AG & 7. \nAG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d apply. \n \n \nIn 1985, Applicant moved to the U.S. after having been attacked in Lebanon and \nthreatened with being beaten and beheaded. In 1995, more than 13 years ago, he, his \nwife and two children became U.S. citizens. He has no foreign assets, investments, \nfinancial or business interests in Lebanon. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters reside in Lebanon. They are dual Lebanese and Canadian \ncitizens. He has contact with his sisters three or four times a year by telephone. His \nbrother who is a U.S. citizen resides in Lebanon. He has contact with his brother every \ntwo or three months. None of his siblings or their spouses have connections with any \nforeign government. Because of his job as a linguist with the U.S. Army in Iraq, he was \nunable to visit Lebanon when his parents died. Applicant last visited Lebanon in 2004. \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who reside in Lebanon, his siblings are in no greater \ndanger than any other individual living and working there.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s step son is a dual U.S. and Egyptian citizen living in Egypt. Applicant \nand his wife visited his step-son in Egypt for one week in 2004 and two weeks in 2006. \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who reside in Egypt, his step-son is in no greater \ndanger than any other individual living and working there.  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\n\u00b6 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.\u201d and \u00b6 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual=s sense of loyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s siblings and step-son.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant stated he is loyal to the \nU.S. and would do nothing to compromise U.S. interests. His allegiance is exclusively to \nthe U.S. Applicant was born in Syria and moved to Lebanon at age six. In 1985, he left \nLebanon and came to the U.S. In 1995, Applicant, his wife, and two children became \nU.S. citizens, and live in the U.S.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Lebanon and Egypt and the \nheavy burden an applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country. \nHis sibling\u2019s jobs, that of their spouses\u2019 or his step-son\u2019s job are not connected to any \nforeign government. His sisters are dual Lebanese and Canadian citizens, his brother is \na U.S. citizen, and his step-son is a dual U.S. and Egyptian citizen.  \n \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Applicant served a year \nwith the U.S. Army as a linguist in the \u201cgreen zone\u201d working closely with the U.S. \nmilitary. As an Arabic linguist working in a combat zone he is a valuable resource to the \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                          \nArmy in helping it achieve its mission in Iraq.11 Because of his close ties and his \nloyalties to the U.S., including his wife and two children (all U.S. citizens), he would \nresolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, duress, or conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1e: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge\n \n11In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an \nexception to the general rule in Guideline B cases when \u201can applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context \nof dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the \nnational security . . .

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a twenty seven-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked since August 2004 in information systems, specializing in networking. The allegations in the SOR under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) relate to Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs and use of prescription drugs in a manner inconsistent with approved medical direction between 2000 and 2007. The illegal drugs were marijuana and cocaine, which he used while in college. He used the drugs as frequently as two to three times a week (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. a. and b.). During his college years, a friend died of a drug overdose and, while this had an effect on him, he continued to use drugs but less often than before the death of his friend. He graduated from college in 2003 and has not used those drugs since then. He no longer sees any of his college friends with whom he used drugs. Applicant is alleged to have used at various occasions, both legally and illegally, the prescription drug oxycodone under the names Tramadol and Percocet (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. c. d. and e.). While he had a prescription for Tramadol, he used it in a manner inconsistent with approved medical direction. The prescription was as a result of pain arising from an auto accident in 2002 (Tr. 46). However, he continued to use it past the time he needed it for pain between 2003 and 2006 and discovered he could not cease using it (Tr. 45). He obtained it on several occasions from internet orders. 3 Applicant also obtained Percocet from his g",

Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 9, \n2006. On February 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), for Applicant. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 22, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non March 17, 2008. I received the case assignment on March 20, 2008. DOHA issued a \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \nNotice of Hearing on April 22, 2008, for a hearing on May 30, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered two exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted four exhibits which were admitted without \nobjection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 11, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Rulings \nAmendment to SOR \nThe government moved to amend the SOR in accordance with evidence submitted \nby Applicant in the following ways: \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. was amended to delete \u201cwithout a prescription\u201d and substitute \u201cin a \nmanner inconsistent with approved medical direction.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and f. were amended to substitute the date February 2007 for \nDecember 2006 in both sections.  \nApplicant had no objection to the amendments (Tr. 9). \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a twenty seven-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has \nworked since August 2004 in information systems, specializing in networking.  \nThe allegations in the SOR under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) relate to \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs and use of prescription drugs in a manner inconsistent \nwith approved medical direction between 2000 and 2007. The illegal drugs were \nmarijuana and cocaine, which he used while in college. He used the drugs as frequently \nas two to three times a week (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. a. and b.). During his college years, a friend \ndied of a drug overdose and, while this had an effect on him, he continued to use drugs \nbut less often than before the death of his friend.  He graduated from college in 2003 and \nhas not used those drugs since then.  He no longer sees any of his college friends with \nwhom he used drugs.  \nApplicant is alleged to have used at various occasions, both legally and illegally, \nthe prescription drug oxycodone under the names Tramadol and Percocet (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. c. \nd. and e.). While he had a prescription for Tramadol, he used it in a manner inconsistent \nwith approved medical direction. The prescription was as a result of pain arising from an \nauto accident in 2002 (Tr. 46). However, he continued to use it past the time he needed it \nfor pain between 2003 and 2006 and discovered he could not cease using it (Tr. 45). He \nobtained it on several occasions from internet orders.  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \nApplicant also obtained Percocet from his grandmother who was using it for \nrheumatoid arthritis (Tr. 59). It is a stronger drug than Tramadol and not available over \nthe internet. He did not have a prescription for Percocet.  \nApplicant tested positive for oxycodone in February 2007, the most recent \nevidence of drug use in the allegations (SOR \u00b6 1. e.).  He received medical treatment at \nthat time because he overdosed on one of the drugs causing seizures. He had planned \non applying for Officer\u2019s Candidate School but the seizures made him ineligible for the \nprogram. As a result of the drug treatment he received, he was prescribed methadone by \nthe doctor. He used it for two weeks until he had no withdrawal symptoms.  \n \nAllegations in the SOR relating to Guideline E (Personal Conduct) also alleged \nthat Applicant was charged with setting off a fire alarm in a dormitory while in college in \n2003 and fined $550 (Tr. 34). He turned himself in to the police the following day after the \nincident. He was also charged with underage drinking in 2001 and his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for 90 days. The incident did not occur while driving (Tr. 33). He admitted \nboth allegations.  \n \nAlso alleged under Guideline E are the first five allegations regarding illegal drug \nuse and illegal use of a prescription drug.  \nApplicant does not now and has never held a security clearance. He seeks one \nbecause the other members of the staff with whom he interrelates have clearances or \nhave applied for them and having one would be helpful in his work.  However, his  work is \nmanagement, so he does not interface with classified information (Tr. 26).  \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and computer \ninformation systems. He is married with a two-year-old daughter. His wife\u2019s parents own \nand operate the company for which he works. He is active in his church with the youth \ngroup where he serves as a minister. Letters from his minister and two others indicate \nthat he is held in high regard by them (Exh. A \u2013 C). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6  24:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed \nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n \n \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n (b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse\u201d, \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug \nuse\u201d, and \u201cillegal drug possession, including . . .  purchase, sale or distribution . . . .\u201d AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25 (a), (b), and (c). The other five disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not \napplicable. These three disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used drugs, \ntested positive for a drug he illegally obtained and used, and possessed drugs.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides several conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nDrug involvement with illegal drugs is mitigated by the passage of a period of five \nyears, since his most recent use of illegal drugs was in 2003. He has removed himself \nfrom contact with drug users.  However, the misuse of prescription drugs last occurred \nonly a little over one year ago. While he initially used the drug because of pain, there is \nno evidence that it grew from a severe or prolonged illness. His treatment from a \nmedical professional grew out of seizures as a result of overdose on the prescription \ndrug.  Thus, I conclude that he has not mitigated the allegations relating to the misuse \nof prescription drugs.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nGuideline E Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nSince the first allegation under this guideline (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) relates to the first five \nallegations under Guideline H, and raises the same issues of trustworthiness to hold a \nsecurity clearance, there is no need to discuss it further under Guideline E.  \n \nThe other two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 2.c.) relate to the two criminal \noffenses that occurred in 2001 and 2003 while Applicant was in college.   \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides one condition that could mitigate security concerns for those \nallegations: \n \n (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n  \nThe mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17 (c) is applicable to those two allegations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nWhile Applicant has shown evidence of rehabilitation by changes in his life style, \nand actions to remove himself from contact with drugs and users of drugs, the period of \ntime elapsed since his last wrongful and illegal use of prescription drugs has not been \nsufficient to warrant a whole person finding in his favor. He failed to take advantage of \nthe lessons he should have learned at the time of the death of his friend in college. He \nalso should have known from his past experience with drug use that becoming \ndependent on a prescription drug might lead to the type of problems he encountered.  \n \n \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his drug use. While he is a young man who \nlikely has learned from his past conduct, it is premature to grant him a security \nclearance at this time.  \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:   Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance at this time.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact4 Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.h, and 1.j (GE 7). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old (Tr. 5). He completed 12 years of school; however, he did not graduate from high school (Tr. 5-6). He began working at a shipyard in 1971, and has continued to work in the shipyard thereafter (Tr. 6). He is a sheet-metal worker (Tr. 41). He currently holds a clearance at the secret level (Tr. 6). He has not had any clearance problems aside from the issues address in this decision for the 30 years he (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. 3I specifically find Applicant was credible in regard to the results of his three random urinalysis tests. I accept those results as accurate without corroborating documentation. 4Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information is available in the cited exhibits. GEs 2 and 3 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 9 (Response to SOR) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise. 3 has held a clearance (Tr. 40). He married when he was 21-years-old and divorced in 2001 (Tr. 24, 33). He has a 24-year-old son, and a 16-year-old daughter (Tr",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 6 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 7, 2008). GE 6 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nGuideline G (alcohol consumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on June 13, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (Government Exhibit (GE) 7). On August 19, \n2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held on September 17, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-4) (Transcript (Tr.) 10, 16-17), and \nApplicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 11). There were no objections, and I admitted \nGE 1-4 (Tr. 17). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and Hearing \nNotice (GE 5-7). I received the transcript on September 23, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I authorized until September 25, 2008, for him to submit documentation about \nthree random urinalysis tests reflecting no alcohol or drug use (Tr. 50-51). However, no \nsuch documentation was received.3  \n \nSOR Amendment \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant disclosed that in April 2007 he was sent home from \nwork because he had alcohol on his breath. He subsequently received additional \nalcohol treatment and counseling. At Department Counsel\u2019s request and without \nobjection, I granted the motion to amend the SOR to include these two allegations \nunder Guideline G (Tr. 44-46). These two additional allegations are designated \nsubparagraphs 1.l and 1.m respectively.  \n \nFindings of Fact4 \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to \n1.h, and 1.j (GE 7). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old (Tr. 5). He completed 12 years of school; however, he \ndid not graduate from high school (Tr. 5-6). He began working at a shipyard in 1971, \nand has continued to work in the shipyard thereafter (Tr. 6). He is a sheet-metal worker \n(Tr. 41). He currently holds a clearance at the secret level (Tr. 6). He has not had any \nclearance problems aside from the issues address in this decision for the 30 years he \n \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3I specifically find Applicant was credible in regard to the results of his three random urinalysis \ntests. I accept those results as accurate without corroborating documentation. \n \n4Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GEs 2 and 3 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 9 (Response \nto SOR) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhas held a clearance (Tr. 40). He married when he was 21-years-old and divorced in \n2001 (Tr. 24, 33). He has a 24-year-old son, and a 16-year-old daughter (Tr. 33). He \nhas two grandchildren (Tr. 33). \n \nAlcohol-related arrests \n \n \nOn September 15, 2001, Applicant was arrested for DUI and failure to reduce \nspeed (SOR \u00b6 1.c, GE 7 at 2). He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve 72 hours \nin jail, pay $150 in fines/costs, and placed on probation for 12 months. Id. \n \n    \nOn January 20, 2003, Applicant was charged with drunk in public. He was found \nguilty, fined $25, and required to pay costs of $64 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, GE 7 at 2). \n \n \nOn February 26, 2004, Applicant was charged with DUI and reckless driving \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f, GE 7 at 2). He was found guilty and sentenced to serve 30 days in jail, with \n25 days suspended, and ordered to attend an Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP). \nId. His driver\u2019s license was restricted, and he was fined $250 plus costs of $199. Id. \n \n \nOn July 16, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, reckless driving, \nand failure to obey traffic light (SOR \u00b6 1.h, GE 7 at 2). He was found guilty and \nsentenced to 12 months in jail (all confinement except for 20 days was suspended), \nfined $1,000 plus costs of $333, and ordered to attend SARP. Id. His driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for three years. Id. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges he was arrested in January 2006 for DUI, and held in jail for \nfour days (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant disclosed the 2006 DUI in his security clearance \napplication, but he did not disclose any other DUIs (GE 1, \u00a7 23). He noted the location \nof the offense as being in North Carolina, and his sentence as a fine and one-year \nsuspension of his license. Id. On January 9, 2007, an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) described Applicant\u2019s description of the 2006 DUI as \nfollows (GE 2): \n \nJan 06, DUI, ____ , NC\u2014He hit a parked car along a highway at night \nafter he had consumed two to three six-packs of beer over a four to five \nhour period. He drank the beer in a bar and while driving. He was pulling \noff the road because he had become sleepy. He did not see it, but there \nwas a car parked in the dark along the road and subject hit it. A ____ \npolice officer came to the accident scene and administered a breath test to \nsubject. He was put in the ____ County Jail for around four days then \nreleased. He obtained a lawyer, but he was found guilty of DUI \nnonetheless. He recalled losing his privilege to drive in North Carolina for \na year and he attended a DUI class. He could not recall any other details \nabout the class.    \n \nIn addition to the DUIs described above, the OPM interview also noted one or \ntwo DUIs from a long time ago, but also noted he was unsure of the details (GE 2). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response denied the 2006 DUI (GE 7). At his hearing, he explained he \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nthought the 2006 DUI was actually the 2001 DUI because he had only been in that \nNorth Carolina city on one occasion (Tr. 34-38). When Applicant completed the DOHA \ninterrogatories and adopted the OPM statement, he did not disagree with the OPM \ninvestigator\u2019s description because he \u201cmentally probably didn\u2019t pick it up\u201d (Tr. 35-36).     \n \nAlcohol rehabilitation and counseling \n \n \nApplicant self-referred for alcohol counseling and treatment in the 1970s when he \nwas in his early 20s (SOR \u00b6 1.b, GE 7 at 1, Tr. 23-24). His alcohol treatment in the \n1970s included in-patient treatment for some months (Tr. 38). He also received alcohol \ntreatment from November 2001 to at least December 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, GE 7 at 2).    \n \n \nApplicant attended a 26-week substance abuse rehabilitation program (SARP) \nfrom about May 25, 2004, until November 29, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g, GE 7 at 2). He was \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. Id. \n \n \nApplicant had black out spells where he was unable to remember his alcohol \nconsumption or where he was, but the most recent one he could recall was \u201cmaybe\u201d five \nyears ago (Tr. 33). \n \n \nApplicant completed a 26-week SARP on about April 12, 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j, GE 7 \nat 2). The SARP recommended ongoing abstinence, 12-step attendance, and relapse \nprevention. (Id., Tr. 25). \n \nApplicant said he had years of sobriety, and then he would have an alcohol \nproblem (Tr. 16). Once he went five years without consuming alcohol, another time it \nwas two years (Tr. 21-22). He drank his last alcohol on April 29, 2007, about 15 months \nprior to his hearing (Tr. 20).  \n \n \nApplicant received counseling through the 12-step program sponsored by \nAlcoholic\u2019s Anonymous (AA) in 2007 and 2008 (Tr. 26). He said he reached the 5th\u2013 \nstep, but was unable to describe that step (Tr. 26).  He said he once had a sponsor, but \nwas unsure of when (Tr. 26). He said his last AA meeting was on April 30, 2007 (Tr. 26-\n27). He conceded he misstated that he attended AA in 2008 (Tr. 27).  He continued to \nconsume alcohol up until April 2007 (Tr. 27). From April 2006 to April 2007, he was \ndrinking a beer a day (Tr. 27). \n \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant had alcohol on his breath at work at 3:30 p.m. from \ndrinking a beer at 6:00 a.m. that morning (Tr. 29). He was suspended from work (Tr. \n30). He attended an outpatient, alcohol-treatment program for eight weeks (Tr. 28-30). \nHe said the prognosis from the 2007 therapy program said \u201cgood things on my progress \nand all that jazz\u201d (Tr. 31). He did not have any other alcohol-related problems at work \n(Tr. 39-40). \n \n \nApplicant returned to work after completing the 2007 alcohol treatment program \n(Tr. 32).  His employer tested him three times for alcohol, and he passed each time (Tr. \n32). Applicant was not concerned about consuming alcohol in the future (Tr. 32). He \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhad AA books, and the support of his family to help him overcome alcohol abuse (Tr. \n32). He knew that he was close to retirement eligibility and alcohol abuse would harm \nhis economic future (Tr. 33).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license is currently suspended and has been suspended for \nthe last three years because of his most recent driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI) in 2005 (Tr. 18). He believed his license would be reinstated once he obtained a \nvehicle with an automatic breath-alcohol testing and locking device (Tr. 19-20). He also \nneeded to pay his fines from the 2005 DUI (Tr. 18).  \n \nApplicant wanted to continue to apply the knowledge and experience he had \ngained over his 37 years working at the shipyard to help the shipyard (Tr. 42). He \ndescribed his job performance as exemplary and emphasized it was separate from his \nalcohol consumption (Tr. 42). He recognized that alcohol abuse was an issue, but \nbelieved he could continue to abstain from alcohol consumption (Tr. 42). He wanted to \ncontinue to contribute to the company and national defense (Tr. 42).  \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.5 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \n \n5\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6\u201fThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), 22(d), 22(e) and 22(g) do not apply. Currently, he does not \nhabitually consume or engage in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired \njudgment. Binge drinking is not defined in the Directive and is not established. A \nqualified medical professional or licensed clinical social worker did not determine \nApplicant had an alcohol abuse or dependence problem. He did not fail to follow any \ncourt orders regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment or abstinence. Although \nhe received an alcohol evaluation from an alcohol or addiction counselor, this credential \ndoes not meet the requirements of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) or 22(e).  \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies. Applicant was convicted of DWIs in 2001, 2004 and 2005, \nand drunk in public in 2003. AG \u00b6 22(b) applies. He was sent home from work in April \n2007 because he had the smell of alcohol on his breath. AG \u00b6 22(f) applies. He \nreceived in-patient treatment for alcohol for several months in the 1970s, and then had \nseveral relapses. He received less intensive, outpatient alcohol treatment in 2004 and \nwas re-enrolled in 2005-2006 (GE 3). The outpatient alcohol treatment program ending \non April 12, 2006, resulted in advice to abstain from alcohol consumption (GE 3).   \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) partially applies. Applicant had five documented alcohol-related \nincidents between 2001 and 2007 that had an adverse effect on his life. He was \nconvicted of three DWIs, drunk in public on one occasion, and was sent home from \nwork in 2007 because of alcohol on his breath. These five events are relatively frequent \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nand recent. He does not drink alcohol and drive, and accordingly he receives some \ncredit because his DUIs, \u201chappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a) cannot be fully applied because he continued to consume \nalcohol up until April 2007. Additionally, he admitted returning to alcohol consumption \nafter previously abstaining from alcohol consumption for up to five years. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not acknowledge being \nalcohol dependent or being an alcoholic. He is minimizing his alcohol consumption \nproblem. Although he completed alcohol abuse treatment programs in the 1970s, in \n2004, 2005-2006, and 2007, he stopped attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and \ndoes not currently attend any other alcohol treatment program. He stopped consuming \nalcohol in April 2007. His long history of alcohol problems and his failure to fully \nrecognize his alcohol problem raises security concerns to receive full mitigating credit.  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.7  \n \nAfter carefully consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption,8 I conclude his five alcohol-related incidents, relapses after alcohol \ncounseling and treatment, and continued alcohol consumption up until April 2007 all \nraise security concerns. His alcohol-related therapy and treatment over the last thirty \nyears are all positive developments, showing that he continues to struggle to overcome \nhis alcohol problems. I therefore find For Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, \n1.j and 1.m. I find For Applicant in SOR \u00b6 1.i because his 2006 DUI is not proven. I find \nFor Applicant in SOR \u00b6 1.k because he no longer consumes alcohol.  \n \n \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   \n \n8For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related \nlegal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge \ndecided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and \nsometimes drank alcohol (not to intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s \ncontinued alcohol consumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most \nrecent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance). \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. He \nrevealed one of his DUIs and some of his alcohol treatment and therapy on his security \nclearance application. He provided much more detailed information about his alcohol \nproblems to an OPM investigator. He admitted in his SOR response and at his hearing \ncomplete information to the best of his recollection. He raised his family and children \nand is a good citizen. He worked for 37 years at the shipyard and has held a secret \nclearance for 30 years. He has not had any DUIs since 2005, and stopped consuming \nalcohol in April 2007. He knows the consequences if he is caught with alcohol on his \nbreath at work or has another DUI. He completed several alcohol treatment programs. \nApplicant is a valued employee, who contributes to his company and the Department of \nDefense. Aside from having alcohol on his breath in 2007, there is no evidence at work \nof any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would \nintentionally violate national security. His character and good work performance shows \nsome responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him \nor he would not have been able to retain his employment over the last three decades. I \nam satisfied that if he continues to abstain from alcohol consumption, he will have future \npotential for access to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a substantial problem with alcohol abuse for about 30 years. He was \nconvicted of DUIs in 2001, 2004 and 2005, and drunk in public in 2003. His employer \nsent him home from work in April 2007 because he had the smell of alcohol on his \nbreath. He received in-patient treatment for alcohol for several months in the 1970s, and \nthen had a relapse. He received less intensive, outpatient alcohol treatment in 2004 and \nwas re-enrolled in 2005-2006 (GE 3). The outpatient alcohol treatment program ending \non April 12, 2006, resulted in advice to abstain from alcohol consumption (GE 3). He \nwas re-enrolled in alcohol treatment in 2007 after he was sent home from work because \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nhe had alcohol on his breath. However, he is not currently receiving alcohol treatment \nand does not attend AA meetings. His problems with alcohol cannot be mitigated at this \ntime. His decision to continue to drink alcohol over the years was knowledgeable, \nvoluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his \nconduct. Excessive alcohol consumption shows a lack of judgment and/or impulse \ncontrol. Such conduct raises a serious security concern, and a security clearance is not \nwarranted at this time. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all \nthe facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption.    \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i to 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 24, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Henry Lazzaro denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\npertinent mitigating conditions was error.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software engineer for\na defense contractor.  Born and raised in Iran, she attended college there, graduating in the 1990s.\nShe met her husband in Iran.  He was born in the U.S. of Iranian parents.  Applicant, her husband,\nand his parents live in the U.S.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the 2000s.  Her\nparents and her one sibling are citizens and residents of Iran.

American citizens visiting\nIran are subject to harassment.  \u201cAmericans of Iranian origin should consider the risk of being\ntargeted by authorities before planning travel\u201d there.  \nIn the Analysis section of his decision, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s case raised security\nconcerns under Guideline B.  In evaluating possible mitigating conditions, the Judge noted\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cvery strong feelings of attachment . . . for her parents and sister, the comparatively short\ntime she has been a U.S. citizen and employed by [a] defense contractor, her expressed intent to\nreturn to Iran for her sister\u2019s wedding and any other family matters that might arise, and the nature\nof the Iranian Government and its relationship with the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 5-6.  He concluded that\nApplicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in her case.  \n  In light of the record as a whole, the Judge has drawn a rational connection between the\nfacts found and his ultimate adverse security clearance decision.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on\nMarch 31, 2008. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 23, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nApril 24, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 20, 2008.

Applicant testified and submitted two documentary exhibits\nthat were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, and admitted into the record without\nobjection. The transcript was received on June 2, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 30-year-old married woman who has been employed as a software\nengineer by a defense contractor since 2005. She was awarded a bachelor of science\ndegree in 2005, after working for the same defense contractor as an intern while attending\ncollege. She is considered to be a responsible person, a valued employee and a team\nplayer. She held a variety of jobs outside the defense industry between the time she\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1999 and when she began working for her current employer. She\nhas never possessed a security clearance. \nApplicant was born and raised in Iran. She attended college in Iran from October\n1996 to April 1999. Her husband was born in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen. His parents\nwere citizens of Iran but attending school in the U.S. when he was born. He returned with\nhis parents to Iran when he was about seven years old and resided there until he was\nabout 20 years old. Applicant met her husband in Iran. He then returned to the U.S. to\napply for an fiancee visa for her. She then immigrated to the U.S. in 1999 and they were\nmarried in August 1999. They do not have any children, but Applicant is expecting a child\nlater this year. Her husband\u2019s parents are now U.S. residents.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father and her sole sibling, a sister, are citizens and residents\nof Iran. Her parents have visited with her in the U.S., most recently in December 2007.\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2005, obtained a U.S. passport in\nMarch 2005, and applied for her parents to become permanent resident aliens very shortly\nthereafter. Her parents have now acquired permanent resident alien status and intend to\nimmigrate to the U.S. within the next two years after they complete selling property in Iran\nand otherwise winding up their personal affairs. Applicant would like to sponsor her sister\u2019s\nentry into the U.S. but has been told that procedure would take about 15 years.    \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 51 years old and her father is 60 years old. Her father works\nfor a food importing and exporting company in Iran. Her mother is a homemaker.\nApplicant\u2019s sister is 27 years old, engaged to an Iranian citizen and resident, and currently\nresides with her parents. Applicant\u2019s sister and her fianc\u00e9 will most likely be married in Iran\nand want to emigrate from there as soon as they can following their marriage. Applicant\nspeaks with her parents and sister by telephone twice a week or more. \n\n3\nApplicant visited her family in Iran for two months in 2001, for one month in 2003,\nfor one month in 2005, and for two weeks in 2006. He husband only accompanied her on\nthe trip in 2005. She possessed an Iranian passport and used that passport for the 2001\nand 2003 trips. She used both passports for the trips in 2005 and 2006. She intends to\ntravel to Iran in the future to attend her sister\u2019s wedding. She also will travel to Iran if It\nbecomes necessary for a reason such as the 2006 trip which was necessitated because\nher father suffered a heart attack. She does not intend to renew her Iranian passport until\nit becomes necessary to visit her family in Iran. \nNeither Applicant nor her husband own any property in Iran. The have purchased\na house in the U.S. that is valued at approximately $400,000. They made a $25,000 down\npayment on this house which was obtained from the proceeds of the sale of a prior house\nthey owned. Applicant has about $5-6,000 invested in a 401K retirement plan and an\nadditional couple of thousand dollars in a savings account. Her annual income is about\n$50,000. \nIran has been identified by the U.S. to be the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\n(GE 10) \nThe U.S. Government defines (Iran\u2019s) areas of objectionable behavior as the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction;\n\u2022\nIts support for and involvement in international\nterrorism;\n\u2022\nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East\npeace process, as well as its harmful activities\nparticularly in Lebanon, as well as in Iraq, Afghanistan,\nand elsewhere in the region; and\n\u2022\nIts dismal human rights record and lack of respect for its\nown people. (GE 5)  \nThe Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens to carefully consider\nthe risks of travel to Iran. Dual national Iranian-American citizens may\nencounter difficulty in departing Iran. . . .\nSome elements of the Iranian regime and the population remain hostile to\nthe United States. As a result, American citizens may be subject to\nharassment or arrest while traveling or residing in Iran. Recently (as of\nJanuary 3, 2008) Iranian authorities prevented a number of Iranian-American\ncitizen academics, journalists, and others who traveled to Iran for personal\nreasons from leaving for several months, and in some cases detained and\nimprisoned them on various charges, including espionage and posing a\nthreat to national security. Americans of Iranian origin should consider the\nrisk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran.

(GE 7) \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines B (foreign influence) and\nC (foreign preference), with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant\nin this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n5\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are citizens and residents of Iran. She maintains very\nclose ties with each of those individuals as evidenced by her frequent telephone contact\nwith them, her parents\u2019 recent visit to the U.S., her frequent and lengthy trips to Iran to visit\nwith them, her sponsoring of her parents in their acquisition of permanent U.S. resident\nalien status, her expressed desire to do the same for her sister, and her emphatic assertion\nthat she will return to Iran to attend her sister\u2019s wedding. While each of these actions is\nunderstandable and even commendable, individually and collectively they raise security\nconcerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a): contact with a foreign family member .\n. . or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country it that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nI have considered all mitigating conditions and find that none apply. Specifically,\nMitigating Condition (MC) 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located . . . are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual\n. . . and the interests of the U.S. does not apply because of the obvious close relationship\nbetween Applicant and her parents and sister and the nature and history of the Iranian\nGovernment. \nLikewise, MC 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person . . . is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can\nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. does not apply because\nof the obviously very strong feelings of attachment that Applicant has for her parents and\nsister, the comparatively short time she has been a U.S. citizen and employed by defense\ncontractor, her expressed intent to return to Iran for her sister\u2019s wedding and any other\n\n6\nfamily matters that might arise, and the nature of the Iranian Government and its\nrelationship with the U. S.   \nApplicant\u2019s frequent contact with her family members in Iran, her repeated travel to\nthat country and her parents travel to the U.S. prohibit application of MC 8(c): contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood\nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. The remaining mitigating\nconditions have no applicability to the facts of this case.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant exercised her Iranian citizenship rights by using an Iranian passport to\ntravel to Iran on four occasions between 2001 and 2006. The last display of the passport\noccurred after she became a U.S. citizen. While the passport has now expired and she has\nnot renewed it, she has made very clear that she will renew and use it in the future to travel\nto Iran to attend her sister\u2019s wedding and for any unexpected future family matters that\nmight arise. However, her use of the Iranian passport was mandated by Iranian law and\nnot by any preference she had for Iran over the U.S. I have considered all potential\ndisqualifying conditions and conclude none apply under the particular facts of this case.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d In this case, there is no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal American\ncitizen or suspect she would ever consider doing harm to the interests of the United States.\nStill, her continuing contacts with Iran as a result of her parents\u2019 and sisters\u2019 residency in\nthat country, her expressed intent to travel to Iran in the future, and the nature of the\nIranian Government and its relationship with the U.S. create a security concern that has\nnot been overcome.    \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis or her acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence\nsecurity concern that exists in this case. She has failed to overcome the case against her\nin this regard or satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline B is decided against\nApplicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nFor  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant answered the SOR 15 April 2008, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 9 May 2008, and I convened a hearing 5 June\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 16 June 2008.\n \nJune 30, 2008\n\nApplicant eventually obtained a graduate degree in May 2004.\n2\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.b., 1.e.,\nand 1.f., and 2.a. She is a 29-year-old consultant employed by a defense contractor\nsince April 2007. She has not previously held a clearance.\nApplicant was born in the U.S. in June 1978, to Iranian nationals residing in the\nU.S. while her father attended school. She obtained U.S. citizenship by birth and\nderived Iranian citizenship through her parents. When she was a year old, she returned\nto Iran with her parents, and resided continuously there until December 2000.\nApplicant was raised and educated in Iran. Her parents opposed the Islamic\nfundamentalist government that took power when the Shah was overthrown in January\n1979, and were imprisoned when Applicant was five years old for that opposition. Her\nfather died in prison two years later, and her mother was imprisoned for six years before\nbeing released. During these six years, Applicant lived with her grandmother, with\nwhom she is understandably close. When Applicant lived in Iran, she voted in one\nelection. The record evidence is contradictory, but Applicant voted absentee in an\nIranian election at least once, possibly twice.\nApplicant graduated from college in Iran in June 2000. She attended college on a\ngovernment-funded scholarship awarded when she passed an entrance examination. In\nJune 2000, she made her pilgrimage to Mecca (Haj), Saudi Arabia, traveling on a\nspecial Haj passport issued by the Iranian government that only permitted her to travel\nfrom Iran to Saudi Arabia and return.\nIn September 2000, Applicant obtained her first U.S. passport, in anticipation of\ntraveling to the U.S. to continue her education.  Because Iran does not recognize her\n2\nU.S. citizenship, Applicant obtained her Iranian passport\u2014required for her to leave Iran\n\u2014in November 2000. In January 2006, she had its validity extended to November 2010\n(G.E. 4). She used her Iranian passport to travel to Iran in December 2004 and\nDecember 2006, because she is unable to enter or exit Iran on her U.S. passport.\nApplicant came to the U.S. in December 2000. In November 2000, she married\nher fianc\u00e9, an Iranian national, after moving up the wedding date because they\nconcluded it would be easier to get him a spouse visa to immigrate to the U.S. than to\nget a fianc\u00e9 visa. Applicant\u2019s spouse immigrated to the U.S. as a legal permanent\nresident in April 2003. Although not legally separated, they began living separately in\nOctober 2006 (G.E. 1), and were subsequently divorced in January 2008 (A.E. A), after\nhe became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant began living with her current boyfriend\n(also an Iranian national) in June 2006; they are now engaged.\nApplicant\u2019s mother immigrated to the U.S. in October 2005, lives with Applicant,\nand is a legal permanent resident (LPR) of the U.S. eligible to apply for her U.S.\n\n3\ncitizenship next year. She intends to do so. However, she has returned to Iran since\nimmigrating to the U.S. to visit her mother and other daughter. Applicant\u2019s sister is a\nresident citizen of Iran, employed as a contact accountant for the government-owned\npetroleum company (G.E. 4, A.E. B). Applicant speaks to her by telephone every two\nweeks, and visits her when she travels to Iran. Applicant\u2019s grandmother is also a\nresident citizen of Iran. Applicant speaks to her by telephone every two months, and\nvisits her when she travels to Iran. Applicant expects to travel to Iran in the future to visit\nher sister and grandmother.\nIn her August 2007 subject interview (G.E. 2), Applicant expressed an\nunwillingness to renounce her Iranian citizenship (which she acknowledge having\nacquired by birth) or to destroy her Iranian passport. She is unwilling to renounce her\nIranian citizenship because Iran law would not allow her to travel to Iran in the future,\nand she wants to be able to visit her sister and grandmother in Iran. In her January\n2008 response to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 3), Applicant restated her unwillingness to\nsurrender her Iranian passport because it would curtail her ability to travel to Iran.\nExcept as noted above, Applicant has no ties to Iran even though she lived most\nof her life there. Her financial interests are all in the U.S. However, the record contains\nno information about her work performance and reliability, or evidence of her\nconnections to the U.S. aside from her residing here since December 2000. \nIran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a poor human rights record. Its\nrelations with the U.S. are confrontational and unlikely to improve given Iran\u2019s efforts to\nacquire nuclear weapons, its sponsorship of, support for, and involvement in,\ninternational terrorism, and its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess. Nevertheless, Iran is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive\neconomic information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation. \nTravel to Iran remains problematic. The Department of State\u2019s May 2007 Travel\nWarning continues to warn U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to Iran,\nnoting that dual national Iranian-American citizens may encounter difficulty in departing\nIran. Some elements of the Iranian government and population remain hostile to the\nU.S. Consequently, American citizens may be subject to harassment or arrest while\ntraveling or residing in Iran. Americans of Iranian origin are urged to consider the risk of\nbeing targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. In addition, Iranian\nauthorities may deny dual nationals access to the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran,\nbecause they are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. Large-scale demonstrations\nhave taken place in various regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a\nresult of a sometimes volatile political climate. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite\nthe travel warning are urged to exercise caution.\nThe U.S. government does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations\nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran, and, therefore, cannot provide protection or routine\nconsular services to American citizens in Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n4\nEmbassy in Tehran, serves as protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran. Neither U.S.\npassports nor visas to the United States are issued in Tehran. The Iranian government\ndoes not recognize dual citizenship and generally does not permit the Swiss to provide\nprotective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals. In addition, U.S.\ncitizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been\ndetained and harassed by Iranian authorities.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\nThe chronology of Applicant\u2019s marriage, her husband\u2019s subsequent immigration to the U.S. and naturalization\n6\nas a U.S. citizen, and their later separation and divorce suggests that his immigration requirements were as\nimportant a consideration for their relationship as any mutual emotional commitment.\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n7\n5\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n4\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.5\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B as regards her mother, her current fianc\u00e9, her sister\u2019s employment, or her\nex-husband and in-laws. Considering first the foreign country involved, Iran and the U.S.\nenjoy strained foreign relations at best. However, Iran is not a known collector of U.S.\nintelligence or sensitive economic information, or known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information. Her divorce largely renders moot the security concerns raised by\nher ex-husband and former in-laws, as those relationships do not appear to have been\nparticularly close.  Security concerns regarding her mother are mitigated by mother\u2019s\n6\nLPR status in the U.S. and her prospective U.S. citizenship. Similarly, her current\nfiance\u2019s LPR status in the U.S. vitiates the potential security concerns raised by their\ncohabitation. The security concerns regarding her sister are attenuated because the\nsister works for a contractor, not directly for the Iranian government. On balance, the\ngovernment\u2019s evidence failed to establish that there was any risk, much less a\nheightened risk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nbecause of these family contacts inside or outside Iran.\nNevertheless, the government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B because of her close and continuing contacts with her sister and her\ngrandmother as evidenced by her regular telephone contact, her travel to Iran in\nDecember 2004 and December 2006, and her stated intent to travel to Iran in the\nfuture.  Ordinarily, travel to a foreign country\u2014even a country of origin\u2014has no\n7\nindependent security significance, but only serves to demonstrate an Applicant\u2019s ties of\naffection to family members residing there. However, in this case Applicant travels to\nIran, and subjects herself to the jurisdiction of a government that is not only hostile to\nthe U.S., but considers her to be only an Iranian citizen and thus likely to be denied\naccess to what little assistance is available to U.S. citizens through the U.S. Interests\nSection in Tehran. Even though Iran is not an active collector of sensitive U.S.\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n8\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . .  (3) ((3) accepting educational  . . .  or other such\nbenefits from a foreign country; . . . (7) voting in a foreign election; b) action to acquire or obtain recognition\nof a foreign citizenship by an American citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n9\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n10\n\u00b6 11. \u00a9 exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n11\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11.(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n12\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n13\ninvalidated; \n6\ninformation, an applicant in Applicant\u2019s circumstances who travels to Iran presents a\npotential target of opportunity that presents an unacceptable risk of being coerced to\nprovide information. I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant obtained an Iranian passport in November 2000, had it extended\nin January 2006, used it to travel to Iran in December 2004 and December 2006, and\nintends to use it to travel to Iran in the future, despite being a U.S. citizen since birth. In\naddition, she also accepted educational benefits from Iran that were only available to\nher as an Iranian citizen and voted in Iranian elections.8\nApplicant has not mitigated the Guideline C security concerns. Although she has\nbeen a dual citizen of Iran and the United States since her birth, her Iranian citizenship\nwould have little security significance if based solely on her parents\u2019 citizenship. For her\nconduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, she must have acted in a\nway to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However,\ninimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required\nbefore the government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with this nation's secrets will make\ndecisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen.\n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference.\nHer dual citizenship is not based solely on her parents\u2019 citizenship, but is based on her\nactive exercise of dual citizenship after being born a U.S. citizen.  She has not\n9\nexpressed a willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship.  All exercise of dual\n10\ncitizenship occurred after she obtained U.S. citizenship, while she was an adult.11\nApplicant's use of her Iranian passport has not been sanctioned by the U.S.  She is not\n12\nwilling to invalidate her passport or refrain from traveling to Iran.  While Applicant has a\n13\nlegal right to maintain her dual citizenship with its attendant benefits and responsibilities,\n\n7\nshe has not demonstrated that she can be counted on to always act in preference to the\nUnited States.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial history. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 7, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on May 19, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nJune 3, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were received \nJuly 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and called one witness, but did \nnot submit documentary evidence. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record \nopen until June 24, 2008, to submit additional matters through Department Counsel. \nApplicant submitted 91 pages of documents. Department Counsel submitted a memo \nlisting the documents as 1 through 17. The memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The \ndocuments were marked Exhibits A1 though A17, and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 13, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was delinquent on ten debts, totaling approximately \n$10,742. It also alleges that she declared bankruptcy in 1992, 1998, and 2005. In her \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to seven debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and \n1.f through 1.j, and she admitted to filing three bankruptcies, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \nthrough 1.m. She denied the three debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2006. She attended college for a period, but did not obtain a \ndegree. She is divorced with two children, ages 17 and 13.1   \n \n \nApplicant married in 1990. She had a difficult pregnancy with their daughter who \nwas born in 1991, and she had to quit work. Her daughter had medical issues which led \nto medical expenses. The combination of the loss of Applicant\u2019s salary and the medical \nexpenses caused financial difficulties and falling behind on their debts. Applicant and \nher husband filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1992. They listed assets of $6,327 and \nliabilities of $42,842. Their dischargeable debts were discharged in 1992.2   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband worked in law enforcement since the 1970s. He has a \nlong history of medical problems which started before they met. He was diagnosed as \ndiabetic in the early 1990s, and has suffered from many complications from the disease. \nPortions of a foot and toes have been amputated. He was hospitalized several times for \npneumonia and had multiple operations to implant stents. Their daughter also has a \nmedical condition that has led to many medical problems and bills throughout her life. \nApplicant did not work outside the home from 1992 through 2005. With the high cost of \nday care and her husband\u2019s staggered work hours, it was not considered practical for \nher to work. He handled the majority of the family finances. Applicant and her husband \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 19-21, 111; Ex. 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 19-21, 77; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; Ex. 1, 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nfiled Chapter 7 bankruptcy again in 1998. They listed assets of $93,110 and liabilities of \n$35,837. The assets included $85,000 in her husband\u2019s accrued retirement benefits \nwhich were being held by the state pension board. Their dischargeable debts were \ndischarged in 1998.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband had a heart attack in 2004. He was finally told to retire \nfrom his law enforcement job, which left him unemployed for a period of six or seven \nmonths. He purchased what he thought was medical insurance, but which was actually \nsome sort of medical indemnity that would pay the medical expenses, but would require \nrepayment. Applicant testified they received a bill from the insurance company for \n$45,000. Applicant and her husband filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2005. The \nbankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2006; additional creditors were \nincluded in the bankruptcy; and their dischargeable debts were discharged in 2006. The \nbankruptcy petition includes a debt to an insurance company of $46,636.4 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband separated in late 2005. Their divorce finalized in \nOctober 2007. She returned to the workforce, but her employment was sporadic and  \nher salary was low. She was unemployed for several months in 2006.5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s one extravagance was a horse that she and her ex-husband \npurchased from a friend for their child during a period when their finances were better. \nThe horse was difficult to sell or donate because the horse had medical issues. \nAdditionally, their child was very attached to it, but they finally were able to place the \nhorse in another state. A veterinarian obtained a judgment against Applicant for $2,647, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, for a vet bill for the horse. The judgment has been fully \nsatisfied.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b lists a debt of $1,108 to a bank. Applicant does not deny that she \nowed this debt, but stated it was discharged in bankruptcy under another name. The \ndebt is listed on the credit reports with the last activity occurring in early 2003. The \nname in the allegation is a bank and the name of the debt included in the bankruptcy is \na credit card. Applicant submitted documentation that the bank issues a credit card \nunder the name listed in the credit reports and the SOR. Applicant would have no \nreason to omit this debt from the bankruptcy. I find this debt was discharged in \nbankruptcy.7  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $907 to a collection company on behalf of a \ncredit card company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. She has agreed to make payments of \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 17-21, 72, 100, 117-123; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; Ex. 4, A4, A12. \n \n4 Tr. at 17, 70, 87-88; Ex. A3, A6, A12. \n \n5 Tr. at 23, 65. \n \n6 Tr. at 36-37, 66-70, 88-89; Ex. 2, A3, A9. \n \n7 Tr. at 37-38, 44-50; Ex. 2, 6, 7, A3, A4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n$100 per month. In her post-hearing submission, she submitted a statement from the \ncreditor as proof of payment. While she did not submit a copy of a cancelled check or a \nreceipt of payment, the statement indicated that the debt was down to $807. I find she \nmade a payment of $100.8 \n \n \nWhen Applicant separated from her ex-husband, she moved to a person\u2019s home \nand paid rent. Applicant paid the rent for a period and then was unable to make the rent \npayments. She moved out owing rent. The landlord obtained a judgment against \nApplicant for $924, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant did not believe she owed the \nentire amount as she gave the landlord a refrigerator, washer, and dryer. However, she \ndid not fight the lawsuit and agrees that she is legally responsible for the entire \njudgment. Applicant and the landlord signed an agreement wherein Applicant promised \nto pay $100 per month until the judgment was paid. Applicant made the first $100 \npayment on June 23, 2008.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e lists a debt of $4,145 to a collection company for nine delinquent \naccounts. The credit report of February 6, 2007, lists the nine accounts to the collection \ncompany. The names of the original creditors are not listed. None of the debts are listed \non the credit report of February 21, 2008. Applicant stated several of the original debts \nwere discharged in her bankruptcy. She provided a statement from the collection \ncompany showing she still owed on four medical accounts. She made five payments of \n$100 each between January 2008 and May 29, 2008, with a remaining balance of \n$966.10  \n \n \nApplicant does not deny that she owed debt of $372 to a collection company, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but she stated it was discharged in bankruptcy under a different \nname. The debt is listed on the credit report of February 6, 2007. It is listed under two \ndifferent names in the credit report of February 21, 2008. Applicant stated this debt was \nincluded in the Schedule of Post-Petition Debt for her bankruptcy. One of the names \nlisted on the credit report of February 21, 2008, is listed to be served a copy of the \nPetition. The evidence supports Applicant\u2019s assertion that this debt was discharged in \nbankruptcy.11  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.j allege four debts totaling $639. The debts are listed on \nthe credit report of February 6, 2007. The credit report indicates that all the debts were \njoint debts and were incurred prior to the last bankruptcy. None of the debts are listed \non the credit report of February 21, 2008. Applicant and her ex-husband both testified \nthat they believed the debts were medical debts that were discharged in their \nbankruptcy under the one or more of the many collection companies listed in the \nbankruptcy. In her post-hearing submission, Applicant stated the debts may still be \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 39; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; Ex. A3, A9, A12. \n \n9 Tr. at 24-25, 39, 60-61; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; Ex. A3, A9. \n \n10 Tr. at 39; Ex. 6, 7, A3, A9. \n \n11 Tr. at 37-38, 72; Ex. 2, 6, 7, A3, A4. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nowed, but that they were her ex-husband\u2019s responsibility since they arose when they \nwere still married, she was not working, and he carried the health insurance for the \nfamily.12  \n \n \nApplicant and her ex-husband paid other debts not listed on the SOR. He \nprepared their income tax returns and they owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \n$8,997 for tax years 1997 through 2003, resulting in a tax lien. The IRS was paid and \nthe tax lien released in December 2007. When Applicant filed her tax returns for tax \nyear 2007, she realized she owed the IRS about $1,061 and the state about $300. She \ndid not have the funds to pay the taxes at that time. She will pay the state $50 per \nmonth until paid. Her employer will deduct $100 per month from her pay for the IRS and \nthe IRS will keep her $600 economic stimulus payment for her tax debt. She changed \nthe number of allowances on her W-4 form, which will increase her withholding, and \nlower what she will have to pay out of pocket when she files next year.13  \n \n \nApplicant and her ex-husband have remained very amicable after their divorce. \nHe testified on her behalf and wrote a letter. He stated she is responsible and a very \nstrong person of character, whose dedication is second to none. She has been an \noutstanding mother, both during and after their marriage. He believes their entire family \nis better off now. He likes her boyfriend and feels that he is good for her.14 \n \n \nApplicant testified that her finances are now in order. Her employment is stable \nas long as she obtains a security clearance. Her salary has increased. She is living with \nsomeone who is financially secure. He does not charge her rent. They have co-mingled \ntheir finances, permitting her to resolve her debts. She bought a used car in September \n2007, for $5,255 in order to commute to work. The car was financed with a $1,000 down \npayment and monthly payments of $709. The car has been paid, freeing extra income \nfor living expenses and to pay other debts. The car is not currently in working order, but \nApplicant has use of her boyfriend\u2019s car. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling. She credibly testified that she intends to pay all her delinquent debts.15 \n \n \nThe president of Applicant\u2019s company wrote a letter stating she is an exemplary \nemployee and very trustworthy. Other letters describe her as honest, dedicated, \ncompetent, professional, efficient, and conscientious. She is recommended for a \nsecurity clearance.16 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 39, 72, 100-102; Ex. 6, 7, A3, A9. \n \n13 Tr. at 25-26, 112-115; Ex. 2, A8, A15. \n \n14 Tr. at 122-123; Ex. A6,  \n \n15 Tr. at 29-33, 62, 95-97, 102-106; Ex. A6, A8, A9 \n \n16 Ex. A6. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant did not work from the time she became pregnant shortly after she \nmarried in 1990, until she separated from her ex-husband in 2005. She accepted the \ntraditional role of the wife and mother and he took care of work and the finances. He \nhad a stable job in law enforcement, but was plagued by numerous medical problems, \nwhich greatly exacerbated their finances. Their only recourse was to file bankruptcy. He \npurchased what they thought was medial insurance, but which in reality was medical \n\u201cassurance\u201d which served as a form of loan. Medical bills were paid by the insurance \ncompany, but then he and Applicant were expected to repay the insurance company. A \ndebt of $46,636 to an insurance company is listed in their bankruptcy petition. Applicant \nincurred delinquent debts on her own after she and her husband separated in 2005. \nShe worked for little pay and had months of unemployment. She now is in much better \nfinancial shape. She has worked for her current employer for about two years and is \nearning a better salary. She is living with her boyfriend who is established financially. \nShe is diligently paying her debts and working on putting her financial house in order.  \n \n \nBecause Applicant is still in the process of paying her debts, I do not find that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) is applicable. I find the conditions that resulted in the financial problem (medical \nproblems with related expenses, unemployment and poor paying jobs) were largely \nbeyond her control. I further find that under the circumstances, filing bankruptcy and \nworking to pay the subsequent debts was responsible behavior. Applicant has not \nreceived financial counseling, but there are indications that her financial problems are \nbeing resolved and are under control. The debts that were discharged in bankruptcy \nwere never paid, but Applicant is attempting to pay all her debts that have accrued since \nthen. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are all partially applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant married a veteran law \nenforcement officer in 1990. She quickly became pregnant with their first child and had \nto quit work. She did not work outside the home during the marriage. He had severe \nmedical problems, with numerous complications from diabetes and a heart attack. Their \nonly viable recourse was to file bankruptcy. They separated in 2005, and divorced in \n2007. She had financial problems of her own after the separation. She worked low \npaying jobs and had periods of unemployment. She now is back on track. She is living \nwith her boyfriend who is financially stable. She is well regarded at her place of work, \nand has received several raises. Her ex-husband spoke very highly of her and her \nboyfriend and stated that the entire family is now better off.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has noted that an applicant is not required to establish that \nshe has paid every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant must \ndemonstrate that she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve [her] financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d17 Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect. \nShe has paid a number of her debts, some alleged in the SOR and some not, but still \nhas debts to pay. However, she credibly testified that she intends to pay her delinquent \ndebts. I find that she has established a plan to resolve her financial problems and has \ntaken significant action to implement that plan.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n17 ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 4 (App. Bd.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on March 13, 2007. On March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 3, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received his response on April 4, \n2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 14, 2008, and I received \nthe case assignment on May 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 13, \n2008, scheduling the hearing for July 16, 2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. The government submitted a List of Government Exhibits, \nExhibit (Ex.) I. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were \nreceived without objection, and testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until July 25, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE J through \nN, without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 24, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nWithdrawal of SOR allegation and Stipulation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Notice, dated May 19, 2008, stating the \nGovernment: \n \n1. Withdraws Guideline E allegations; and \n \n2. Stipulates that Applicant has paid the debts alleged in 1.a., 1.c., 1.e., 1.i., \n1.o., and 1.p. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations with explanations. His denials with \nexplanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior field engineer, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since November 2007. GE 1, Tr. 56-57. He seeks a security \nclearance to enhance his position. Tr. 40, 57-58.  \n \nApplicant graduated from college in June 1997 with a bachelor of science in \ncomputer information science. GE 1, Tr. 56. He has never married and has no \ndependents. GE 1. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his March 2007 e-QIP, his January 2008 Response to DOHA \nFinancial Interrogatory, and his April 2007 and February 2008 credit reports. GE 1 \u2013 4.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 19 separate line items, which included one \njudgment, 12 collection accounts, two charged off accounts, and four past due \naccounts approximating $48,000. Two of the debts are duplicates, i.e. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. \nand 1.j., thus reducing the number of valid debts from 19 to 18. \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to an extensive period of \nunemployment/underemployment from December 2002 to March 2007. Applicant lost \nhis job as a senior systems analyst in December 2002. At that time, he was making \n$75k per year. Tr. 70. For the next five years, he held a number of jobs to include \ngrocery story cashier, driver for an auto parts store, salesman for a kitchen and \ncabinet shop, grocery store bakery clerk, technical systems support, and office \nmanager/kitchen salesman/bookkeeper for a kitchen and cabinet shop. From 2002 to \n2007, he went \u201con over a hundred interviews.\u201d Tr. 26. During this time, he was also \nplagued with medical problems such as hypertension, kidney and urological issues \nrequiring frequent medical treatment, which compounded Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems.  Tr. 63-65.  \n  \nSince his SOR was issued, Applicant has paid, settled and/or resolved all debts \nalleged. As noted, before the hearing convened, the Government stipulated that \nApplicant had paid debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., 1.e., 1.i., 1.o., and 1.p. \nAdditionally, Applicant has paid debts alleged in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.g., 1.q., 1.r., and 1.s. \nHe is engaged in good-faith disputes for debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., and 1.f. As \nnoted, debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h., and 1.j. are duplicates or the same debt. \nApplicant has written numerous letters to these creditors in an attempt to resolve this \ndebt. The remaining debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., and 1.n. are outstanding. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.l. are student loans and have been consolidated. Applicant is \ncurrently paying a collection agency $275 for one year and after that his student \nloan(s) will be rehabilitated. Applicant is actively engaged in seeking a resolution with \nthe creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m. and 1.n., a student loan and an automobile loan, \nrespectively. AE M. Applicant provided sufficient and voluminous documentation \naddressing each and every debt in the SOR. GE 2, Answer to SOR, AE F \u2013 H, AE N. \nApplicant reported his current annual salary is $70k per year. \n \nApplicant also sought the assistance of a professional financial counselor. The \ncounselor provided him with a comprehensive debt management strategy. After \nApplicant has paid all expenses, he has approximately $118 remaining in discretionary \nincome per month. AE L. Applicant also submitted a budget that breaks down every \ndebt with corresponding monthly payments to each creditor. AE K. \n \nApplicant provided six favorable reference letters. i.e. a letter from his landlord, \nfour work-related references, and one personal reference. All references support the \nnotion that Applicant is trustworthy and honorable. AE A \u2013 E, AE I. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant owed substantial debt as reflected \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a. \u2013 1.s. Applicant\u2019s indebtedness stems from a five year period of \nunderemployment and unemployment. During this time, he fell behind with his \ncreditors. In March 2007, his life took a turnaround when he was fortunate to secure a \njob in his career field that paid $70k per year.  \n \nHis financial situation has substantially improved as a result of earning more \nincome. He sought financial counseling that provided him with a comprehensive \nstrategy to regain financial stability. He has established a credible budget. All \nindicators point to an individual who has taken this process quite seriously and taken \nwhat appears to be all reasonable steps to correct his financial situation. What is \ndifferent now as opposed to before is he has the means, tools and resolve to achieve \nfinancial stability. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline F by showing Applicant \nowed the debts as alleged, except as noted, by the evidence presented. At the time \nthe SOR was issued in April 2008, Applicant owed 18 debts approximating $48,000. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are three potentially mitigating conditions: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nI am able to apply full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because at the time Applicant \nincurred the debts, he was either underemployed or unemployed for a five-year \nperiod. I am able to apply full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because Applicant has sought \nfinancial counseling and has a viable strategy to achieve financial stability and a \ncredible budget. I am able to apply full credit under AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. In \nshort, Applicant has turned his financial situation around. He has established a viable \nbudget, which shows a net remainder after he has paid his bills, and is able to save \nmoney. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.s.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.c.:  \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant is a 54-year-old Information Technology (IT) software developer/ infrastructure technology manager working for a Government contractor (Tr. 29-30). He received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in India In 1977. He traveled to the United States in 1981 under a graduate student visa and has remained in the United States thereafter. In 1983, he completed his Master\u2019s Degree in Mechanical Engineering at a U.S. university (Tr. 6). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997. He has worked for his current employer, a Government contractor, since 2005. He received interim access to classified information at the secret level in 2005 and worked on several classified projects (Tr. 30). His access was withdrawn pending resolution of the allegations in the current SOR. There is no evidence he ever compromised classified information or that he has failed to follow the rules for handling classified information. He has no police record, and there is no evidence he has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. Applicant has been married twice. He married his first wife in 1978 in India, and they were divorced in 1994. He has a 27-year-old daughter and a 20-year-old son of this marriage. Applicant does not ha",

As of the date \nof the hearing, he had 12 accounts, owing approximately $13,602 most of which had \nbeen delinquent for many years. His evidence is insufficient to show that he has a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. He failed to mitigate security concerns regarding \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 16, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Standard Form (SF) 86.1 On April 18, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The \nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). It detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 26, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 4, 2008. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on June 10, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on June \n30, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 41). Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented \none witness and 16 documents identified as Applicants Exhibits (AE) 1-16 (Tr. 52). \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 11, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations, with the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c, which he admitted. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After \na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old Information Technology (IT) software developer/ \ninfrastructure technology manager working for a Government contractor (Tr. 29-30). He \nreceived his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in India In 1977. He traveled to the United States in \n1981 under a graduate student visa and has remained in the United States thereafter. In \n1983, he completed his Master\u2019s Degree in Mechanical Engineering at a U.S. university \n(Tr. 6). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a Government contractor, since 2005. He received interim access to \nclassified information at the secret level in 2005 and worked on several classified \nprojects (Tr. 30). His access was withdrawn pending resolution of the allegations in the \ncurrent SOR. There is no evidence he ever compromised classified information or that \nhe has failed to follow the rules for handling classified information. He has no police \nrecord, and there is no evidence he has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. \n \nApplicant has been married twice. He married his first wife in 1978 in India, and \nthey were divorced in 1994. He has a 27-year-old daughter and a 20-year-old son of \nthis marriage. Applicant does not have any legal child support obligations with respect \nto these children. However, he testified both are financially dependent on him. He \nmarried his current wife in 2001. They have a five-year-old son born of this marriage. \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in India. She became a Canadian citizen, and was a \nCanadian resident prior to marrying Applicant. She has lived in the United States with \nApplicant since 2001. She was unable to work in the United States because she lacked \na work permit (Tr. 103). She is in the process of applying for her U.S. citizenship. After \nher son\u2019s birth she decided to stay home and take care of her son. She is a homemaker \nand does not contribute financially to the household.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his security clearance application, his answers to DOHA \ninterrogatories, six credit bureau reports (CBRs) from 2005 (GE 4), 2007 (three, GE 5-\n7), and 2008 (two, GE 8 and 9), and records of judgments entered against Applicant. \nThe SOR alleges 25 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $61,405.  \n \nApplicant has worked in the IT field most of his life. Prior to September 11, 2001, \nhe was fully employed working as an independent contractor for an IT company on the \nEast Coast of the United States. He was earning around $120,000 a year as a software \nconsultant and developer (Tr. 32, 92). After September 11, the IT market demand dried \nup and Applicant lost his job. He claimed he was unemployed or underemployed from \nOctober 2001 to April 2004. He said he was only able to work part-time jobs during \n2002, and that he was out of work most of 2003 (Tr. 92-94). He received unemployment \nbenefits. Applicant explained he was forced to use his credit cards to pay for his family\u2019s \nday-to-day living expenses. He accumulated numerous debts which became delinquent \nand remained delinquent to the hearing date. \n \nDuring his unemployment period, Applicant became sick and was hospitalized. \nHe stated that because he was unemployed he had no medical insurance to pay for his \nblood pressure medications. In 2003, he was forced to take a $50,000-a-year job on the \nWest Coast to be able to provide for his family. In 2004, his luck changed and Applicant \nobtained full time employment. He continued to work full time, and made good money, \nuntil around March 2008 when his interim clearance was withdrawn. Although he \nreceived lucrative employment offers from many government agencies, Applicant \ncannot accept any employment offers until he receives a security clearance. He has \nbeen forced again to take part-time employment or to be underemployed.  \n \nApplicant admitted most of the debts from 2001 to 2004 alleged in the SOR were \nlegitimately his debts (Tr. 32). He is disputing some of the debt\u2019s totals (limit fees, late \nfees, and high interest rates), and claimed other debts are not valid or were not his \ndebts. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant explained the debt arose out of a broken \napartment lease. He rented an apartment and when his job contract ended, he vacated \nthe apartment and failed to pay five months rent (Tr. 74-82, 141). In 2006, the creditor \nfiled suit and Applicant received summons to appear in court. He failed to appear in \ncourt and a $2,761 judgment was filed against him. He claimed that in 2007 he hired an \nattorney to assist him to settle this debt, but the creditor is asking for $9,000 to settle. \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant has refused to pay the $9,000. After his hearing, he sent a settlement offer to \nthe creditor (AE 16, encl. c). \n \nApplicant acquired the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b when he was laid off \nin 2001. Applicant admitted he did not contact the creditor or tried to resolve this debt \nuntil two weeks prior to his security hearing. He explained that prior to 2005 he had no \nmoney to pay or settled the debt. He then forgot about it because he received no \ncollection statements due to his many job related moves (Tr. 143-146). Applicant settled \nthis debt after his hearing for $3,000 (AE 16, encl. a). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.s, and 1.y alleged credit card debts to the same creditor that were \nconsolidated for a total debt of $22,165. Applicant settled the debts in June 2008 for \n$7,000 (AE 4). Concerning the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, he explained he purchased a \n$6,000 television and stereo set from Sears in 1999. One component stopped working \nand instead of having it repaired under his warranty contract, he selected a new \ncomponent and demanded an exchange. The merchant denied the exchange and \ncharged Applicant for the new component. Applicant has refused to pay this debt (Tr. \n115, 147). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.j alleged the same debt. In 2005, Applicant leased an \napartment for six months while working in Georgia. His job ended and he claimed he \nhad no money to pay the lease so he left without honoring his contract. At his hearing, \nhe admitted this was a valid debt and promised to pay it (Tr. 118, 154). \n \nApplicant disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and has no intention to pay it \n(Tr. 127-128). In 2000-2001, he entered into a wireless telephone service contract for a \nphone he used while working overseas. He claimed the provider promise to give him an \nitemized billing statement. He intended to use it to claim business call expenses from \nhis employer. Because the provider failed to give him the itemized billing statement he \nwas not able to claim the business use of the phone.  \n \nHe initially denied the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g claiming he had no \nknowledge of this debt. His wife clarified this was a legitimate debt that needed to be \nresolved. Applicant used this credit card during 2001-2002 and failed to pay it. After his \nhearing, Applicant contacted the creditor seeking a settlement (AE 16). SOR \u00b6 1.h \nalleged a valid debt for medical services provided to Applicant\u2019s son in 2007 (Tr. 114-\n115, 151). Applicant claimed he was working with his insurance company to pay the \ndebt (AE 16 at 3). Applicant settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i after his hearing (AE \n16 at 30-31). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l alleged the same debt concerning an apartment Applicant \nrented in 2004 (Tr. 69, 119, 123). He is disputing charges resulting from alleged \ndamage to the apartment and cleaning fees. Applicant testified he was never made \naware of the deficiencies when he cleared the apartment. He claimed he first became \naware of the alleged debt in 2007 when he saw it on his credit report. In 2007, he and \n\n \n \n5 \n \nhis wife applied to purchase a home and his credit was questioned because of this and \nother debts. He formally disputed the debt in April-May 2008 (AE 10). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m concerns a legitimate debt Applicant owes since 2000 resulting from \na broken apartment lease (Tr. 124-126, 156). After the hearing, Applicant made an offer \nto the creditor to settle the debt (AE 16). He formally disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n, and the debt was cancelled (AE 16, encl. G). Concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q, \nApplicant conceded he had one account with the telephone service provider back in \n1998-2000 (Tr. 129, 157). He denied having two accounts with the provider. I find SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q alleged the same debt. Applicant claimed he was not aware of this \ndelinquent debt until he reviewed his 2007 CBR. He was unable to investigate the \naccount, but promised to do so and to pay the debt if it is legitimate.  \n \nApplicant denied ever having any account with the telephone service provider \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p (Tr. 113). He was not aware of this delinquent debt until he \nreviewed the 2007 CBR. He also denied having any knowledge of the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r (AE 2, Tr. 160) and 1.t (Tr. 160-161). \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.u, Applicant denied ever ignoring any U.S. court \ncorrespondence and averred he never had any dealings with the court in the allegation. \nIn July 2008, he contacted the court and was informed the court had no claim of action \npending against him (AE F). Regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.w, Applicant initially testified \nhe paid these accounts (See AE 2, AE 5, and 6). However, after the hearing he \nsubmitted a contradicting statement indicated that he made settlement offers on these \naccounts and is waiting for the creditors\u2019 response (AE 16, at 4). \n \nApplicant missed two child support payments when he was laid off in 2001 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.x). He credibly testified he quickly paid this debt. There is no evidence he was \ndelinquent again in his child support obligations. Applicant has no current legal support \nobligation towards his adult children, and has no outstanding child support debts (AE 7). \n \nApplicant stated that until he lost his interim security clearance, he had the ability \nto pay his financial obligations and past debts. He promised to pay, settle or resolve all \nhis legitimate debts. However, he was concerned again now about his financial situation \nafter losing his interim security clearance because he was forced to take a lesser paying \njob. He has received no financial counseling (Tr. 118). He and his wife handled all of his \nfinancial budgets and transactions. Applicant and his wife have two paid off vehicles. He \ndrives a 2005 Toyota purchased new for $32,000. He explained he earned a lot of \nmoney in 2005 working very long hours and purchased the vehicle. His wife drives a \n2006 Scion XL purchased in 2006 for around $14,000 (Tr. 110-111). Applicant owns five \n401(k) accounts with a total value of approximately $140,000 (Tr. 133). \n \nApplicant and his family are loyal U.S. citizens. His loyalty or his family\u2019s loyalty \nto the United States is not an issue on these proceedings.  \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n4  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in his security clearance \napplication, his answers to the DOHA interrogatories, his credit reports, and his \ntestimony. As of the hearing date, he had 12 outstanding debts totaling approximately \n$13,602 which have been delinquent for a long period of time. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,5 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions fully apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts between 2004 and 2008. He was unemployed and underemployed from 2001 to \nearly 2004. He was successfully employed from 2004 to 2008 and earned enough \nmoney to purchase outright two cars totaling approximately $46,000, and accumulated \napproximately $140,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. Notwithstanding, Applicant \npresented little evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve, to settle, or to pay his \ndelinquent debts until after receipt of the SOR. Moreover, he did not make sufficient \nprogress on resolution of his 2006 judgment. These factors cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 \n20(b): \u201cThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances\u201d, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony established factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his \nperiod of unemployment and underemployment from 2001 to 2004; his medical \ncondition and the financial expenses associated with it; the lack of financial assistance \nfrom his wife; and the birth of his son in 2002.  \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n \n9 \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations between 2004 and his receipt of the SOR. Applicant has been \nconsistently employed since 2004 and made sufficient income to pay cash for two cars \nand to make substantial contributions to his 401(k) plan. However, he presented little \nevidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment plans, \nbudgets, or financial assistance/counseling prior to receipt of his SOR. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he has \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility.6   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not fully apply. Applicant did not receive \nfinancial counseling. Since learning about the Government\u2019s security concerns, \nApplicant has taken affirmative steps and made significant progress to resolve, settle, or \nto pay his delinquent debts. I believe that if he continues his efforts, in the near future he \nwill be able to establish that his financial problem is being resolved or is under control. \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s last minute addressing of his delinquent obligations does not \nestablish good-faith7 efforts in the resolution of his debts. Applicant disputed several \ndebts and provided correspondence to document those disputes.

The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n6  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd.

The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s years of working for Government contractors weighs in his favor. \nAside from his delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-\nabiding citizen, a good father, and loving husband. He expressed regrets for his \nfinancial mistakes and, as of late, he is trying to correct them.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, maturity, his years working for the Government contractors, he \ndemonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial \naffairs. Applicant admitted most of the credit card debts from 2001 to 2004 alleged in \nthe SOR were his debts. Mainly, he is disputing limit fees, late fees, and high interest \nrates accrued after the debts became delinquent. Five of his delinquent debts \nconcerned broken apartment leases. He rented apartments and when his job contract \nended, he vacated the apartments and failed to honor his leases. One debt concerns \nhis failure to appear in court and the ensuing judgment filed against him. Applicant has \nrefused to pay that judgment. He failed to deal responsibly with his financial obligations \nfrom 2004 until receipt of his SOR. His failure to honor his contracts and to meet his \nfinancial obligations indicates poor self-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. His behavior raises questions about his reliability, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a; 1.d \u2013 1h; \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n1.m; 1.o; 1.r; 1.t; 1.v, and 1.w: \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b; 1.c; 1.i; 1.j; 1.k; \n \nFor Applicant \n1.l; 1.n; 1.p; 1.q; 1.s; 1.u; 1.x, and 1.y: \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

On December 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 29, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  I received the case assignment on March 13,\n2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 28, 2008.  \n\n2\nThe hearing was convened on May 15, 2008.  The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, without\nobjection. The Applicant requested that the record remain open for the submission of\nadditional documents.  The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F on May 21, 2008,\nand it was received without objection.  The record closed on May 28, 2008.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on June 3, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 65 and single.  He is employed by a Defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the Defense\nindustry.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant began working in the Defense industry in October 2002.  This is\nhis third career.  He served in the United States Armed Forces from 1960 to 1980,\nretiring as an E-7.  He then began a second career in the insurance industry, beginning\nin 1985.  That was going well until 1994, when his employer downsized, forcing him to\nmove to a higher cost area and take a demotion.  The subsequent severe drop in\nincome, combined with maintaining two houses and supporting his aging father in\nanother state, forced the Applicant into bankruptcy in 1997.  (SOR subparagraph 1.a.)\n(Transcript at 18-22, 62; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nThe Applicant remained with the insurance company until 2000, despite the\nsevere drop in income, in order to qualify for retirement.  He retired as soon as he was\neligible in 2000.  The years 2000 through 2002 were very difficult for the Applicant.  He\nwas unemployed the majority of that time, living on his two retirement checks.  His\nyearly taxable income for 2001 totaled $3,805.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  Finally, the\nApplicant had triple bypass surgery in 2002.  (Transcript at 23.)  \nThe Applicant began working for the Defense industry in October 2002.  It took\nhim three years to get his income in a position where he felt he could resolve his past\ndue indebtedness.  He has been able to consistently pay his current debts since\nbeginning employment.  All of the indebtedness dates to the period when he was\nunemployed, underemployed and had his bypass.  In October 2005 the Applicant began\nworking with a debt resolution company.  They are helping him with all of the debts in\nthe SOR.  The Applicant has been disappointed in how the company has worked for\nhim in the two plus years since he hired them, but his debt situation is improving.\n(Transcript at 24-25, 55-57; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owes this creditor\napproximately $2,000.00 for a credit card bill. He testified that the debt resolution\n\n3\ncompany is currently in negotiation with this creditor and hopes to resolve this debt\nwithin 60 days from the date of the hearing.  They are proposing a payment to the\ncreditor of $1,000.00.  (Transcript at 26-27.) \nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits owing this credit card account in the\namount of $9,730.00.  The debt resolution company reached an agreement with this\ncreditor.  In accordance with the agreement an initial payment of $4,000.00 was made\non May 15,2008.  The Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence is that he has the ability\nto continue to make payments of $350.00 per month required to resolve this debt by\nNovember 2008.  (Transcript at 27-30; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F.)  \nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits that he owed a bank $7,362.00 for a\ncredit card.  This debt was settled for lesser amount in July 2007, as confirmed by a IRS\nForm 1099 supplied to the Applicant, and the Government\u2019s most recent credit report.\n(Transcript at 15, 30; Government Exhibit 5 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant admits that he owes $11,638.00 for another\ncredit card.  He is saving money in his 401k.  When his funds reach a certain level,\n$3,000.00 to $4,000.00, he borrows it from the account and the debt resolution\ncompany will use these funds to resolve the debt on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.  This debt\nshould be resolved in the next year.  (Transcript at 30-31, 59-60.)\nThe Applicant submitted that his current financial situation is stable.  He is able to\npay his current debts and work towards resolving his past due indebtedness.  His\nfinancial difficulties were over a limited time, and he is working to pay those debts that\nare his in a reasonable and timely manner.  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters from a supervisor and a co-worker.  They\ndescribe the Applicant as a \u201cloyal, trustworthy and dependable friend and co-worker.\u201d\nOne of the letters also describes the Applicant\u2019s activities as Treasurer of a sporting\nclub.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThere is evidence in the record that the Applicant may have owed approximately\n$30,836.00 to the creditors named in the SOR.  The evidence is sufficient to raise this\npotentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . . .\nunexpected medical emergency), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d\n The majority of the Applicant\u2019s past due indebtedness was incurred between\n2000 and 2002 when the Applicant retired, was unemployed while receiving job training\nand had a triple heart bypass.  As described at length above, once the Applicant was\nemployed in the Defense industry, he began working with a debt resolution company to\npay off his past due indebtedness and, for almost three years, has been successfully\nfulfilling it.  I find the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur, it also occurred because of a medical emergency, and it does not raise\nconcerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence\nraises this potentially mitigating condition.\n \nAG \u00b620(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b620(d).  \nThe Applicant has successfully paid off one of the debts before the SOR was\nissued.  A substantial down payment has been made toward the resolution of a second\ndebt, and the other two debts are being negotiated in turn.  Over $11,000.00 of debt has\n\nThe Applicant plays golf in his leisure time.  I have considered the expenses of this hobby in the context of\n1\nhis work to resolve his past due debts and find that they are not an undue or excessive amount under the\ncircumstances.\n6\neither been paid off or forgiven in the past year.  By his own admission, the Applicant\nhas been somewhat disappointed in the conduct of his debt resolution company.\nHowever, the fact remains that their use is appropriate and the payment schedule is not\nexcessively long under these particular circumstances.  I conclude these potentially\nmitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The record shows that the Applicant\nhad two successful careers before his current problems began.  He is respected in his\ncurrent job and his friends and associates entrust him with their own funds.  \nThe Applicant, by his own admission, had debt problems between 2000 and\n2002.  The reasons are described at length above.  His Social Security records\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C) show a drop in income from $32,838.00 in 1999 to $3,805.00 in\n2001.  Rather than avoid his debts, once he obtained steady and well-paying\nemployment in the Defense industry, he began working with a reputable debt resolution\ncompany to resolve his debts.  He has a plan to pay all of his debts and is fulfilling it.\nHe has behaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and\nthat the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)).  \n1\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant replied to the SOR, as amended, as follows: (1) she admitted a 1983 state criminal conviction for theft of property of a value of more than $100 but less than $250; (2) she admitted a 1992 state criminal conviction for possession of cocaine; (3) she admitted using cocaine and marijuana in May 1992; and (4) she admitted termination from employment due to failing a random drug test in April 2006 when she tested positive for cocaine, but she maintained it was due to a false positive. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor. Hired in 2007 to work as a custodian, she was recently promoted to a material specialist (Exhibit D). She has lived in the same community for 45 years and at the same address since 1988. She has been married to her current spouse since 1997. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance for her employment with a company engaged in defense contracting. In March 1983, a state court convicted Applicant of theft of property of more than $100 but less than $250, which stemmed from her November 1982 arrest for second- degree burglary, theft over $1,000, and theft over $100.

They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.\nThe Directive is pending revision or amendment. \n1\n                                                             \n                           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n         DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\n          \n            \nIn the matter of:\n)\n)\n--------------------------------  \n)\nSSN: ------------------------\n)\nISCR Case No. 07-14490\n)\nApplicant for Security Clearance\n)\nAppearances\nFor Government: Robert E. Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James E. Watson, Personal Representative\n \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 17, 2009, and then amended it on\nApril 15, 2009. The amendment to the SOR adds a security guideline as SOR \u00b6 2, and\nin SOR \u00b6 2.a it refers to the information previously alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.d. The\nJuly 14, 2009\n\n Exhibit 5 is a copy of the state statute addressing setting aside a judgment of a convicted person.\n2\n2\nSOR, as amended, is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual\nbasis for the action. The issues here fall under Guideline E for personal conduct and\nGuideline H for drug involvement. \nApplicant replied to the SOR on March 17, 2009, and then to the amendment on\nMay 1, 2009. She requested a hearing, which took place on June 3, 2009. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on June 11, 2009. For the reasons discussed below, this\ncase is decided against Applicant.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant replied to the SOR, as amended, as follows: (1) she admitted a 1983\nstate criminal conviction for theft of property of a value of more than $100 but less than\n$250; (2) she admitted a 1992 state criminal conviction for possession of cocaine; (3)\nshe admitted using cocaine and marijuana in May 1992; and (4) she admitted\ntermination from employment due to failing a random drug test in April 2006 when she\ntested positive for cocaine, but she maintained it was due to a false positive. Based on\nthe record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor. Hired in 2007 to work\nas a custodian, she was recently promoted to a material specialist (Exhibit D). She has\nlived in the same community for 45 years and at the same address since 1988. She has\nbeen married to her current spouse since 1997. She is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance for her employment with a company engaged in defense contracting. \nIn March 1983, a state court convicted Applicant of theft of property of more than\n$100 but less than $250, which stemmed from her November 1982 arrest for second-\ndegree burglary, theft over $1,000, and theft over $100. She was sentenced to\nprobation for two years. In September 1984, the state court set aside the conviction and\njudgment, released her from all penalties, and restored her civil rights under state law\n(Exhibit A).2\nIn September 1992, a state court convicted Applicant of possession of narcotics\n(cocaine), which stemmed from her May 1992 arrest for possession of narcotics and\ndriving under the influence of alcohol. She had approximately 132 milligrams of cocaine\nin her possession (Exhibit 3 at 2). She was sentenced to probation for two years and\nordered to pay a sizable fine. Besides alcohol, Applicant had used cocaine and\nmarijuana before her arrest. She completed her probation, and in March 2000 the state\ncourt set aside the conviction and judgment, released her from all penalties, and\nrestored her civil  rights under state law (Exhibit B).\nApplicant was working as a maintenance technician in April 2006 when she was\nrequired to submit to random drug testing (Exhibits 2 and C). She tested positive for\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n3\ncocaine metabolites. Based on the positive test result, her employer terminated\nApplicant effective April 12, 2006, due to violating company policy. In turn, Applicant\ninformed the company that she doubted the result and believed it was a false positive\nbased on over-the-counter medications she was then taking. In a letter dated April 25,\n2006, the company\u2019s human-resources manager informed Applicant of the following: (1)\nthat the termination decision stood; (2) that Applicant failed to inform the company or\nthe sample-collection provider in advance of any medications that could result in a\npositive drug test; and (3) a certified scientist/toxicologist at the lab reviewed the list of\nmedicines Applicant claimed she was taking and confirmed that they would not cause a\npositive test result. Thereafter, Applicant did not contest the matter because she did not\nhave the means to do so. Instead, she elected to move on with her life. After a short\nperiod of unemployment and a job working as kitchen help, she began her current\nemployment about one year later.\nBefore starting her new job, she completed a security-clearance application in\nMarch 2007 (Exhibit 1). In it, she disclosed her record of criminal conduct as well as her\njob termination due to the positive drug test. Also, she noted that her request for a\nsecond test was denied, and she asserted that the positive drug test was due to using\nover-the-counter drugs. In addition to the security-clearance application, Applicant was\nrequired to undergo pre-employment drug screening, and the results were negative.  \nApplicant described herself as a recovering alcoholic (Tr. at 60). She maintains\nshe has not used illegal drugs since May 1992, and she has abstained from alcohol\nsince August 1995 (Exhibit 3 at 4). Alcohol was her chief problem, and her illegal drug\nuse stemmed from poor judgment when she was using alcohol. \nApplicant presented several letters from individuals vouching for her good\ncharacter (Exhibits E, F, and G).  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n4\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any\n5\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n The nine factors of the whole-person concept are set forth in the Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n4\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept.  A person granted access to classified\n13\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n16\n5\nAnalysis\nExcept for the 1983 theft conviction in SOR \u00b6 1.e\u2014which is decided for\nApplicant due to passage of time without recurrence\u2014the SOR allegations are the\nsame under each guideline. But before addressing the security concerns under the\nguidelines, it is necessary to decide a threshold issue. \nThe central or overarching issue is Applicant\u2019s claim that her 2006 positive drug\ntest was due to a false positive. After careful review of the documentary evidence and\nhaving had an opportunity to listen to Applicant\u2019s testimony and observe her demeanor,\nthat claim is decided against Applicant due to lack of proof. She did not present credible\nand reliable evidence to rebut or explain the 2006 positive drug test. For example, she\ndid not present evidence from a certified scientist, toxicologist, or other qualified\nindividual to support her false-positive claim. Likewise, she did not present persuasive\nevidence that her sample\u2019s collection or testing or both were faulty. Also, her false-\npositive claim is undermined by her admitted past possession and use of cocaine.  \nTaken together, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and cocaine, her drug-related\ncriminal conduct, and her job termination due to testing positive for cocaine raise\nsecurity concerns under both guidelines and call into question her judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. The particular concerns are set forth below.\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n15\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n16\nThe pertinent DC under the guideline is as follows:\nCredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10. \n17\n Under the whole-person concept, it is proper to consider, among other things, (1) the presence or absence\n18\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes, and (2) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n20\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n21\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n22\n Under the whole-person concept, it is proper to consider, among other things, (1) the presence or absence\n23\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes, and (2) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n6\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.17\nThis DC applies against Applicant because her use of marijuana and cocaine,\nher drug-related criminal conduct, and her job termination due to testing positive for\ncocaine, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.d, support a whole-person concept of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations. I reviewed and considered the MC under the guideline, but conclude that\nnone apply. Specifically, given that I rejected her false-positive claim as an explanation\nfor the 2006 positive drug test, I cannot accept as true Applicant\u2019s contention that she\nno longer engages in drug abuse.  Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against\n18\nApplicant. \n2.\nThe Drug Involvement Security Concern\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n19\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n20\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d21\nThe pertinent DCs are drug abuse, testing positive for illegal drug use, and illegal\ndrug possession.  I reviewed and considered the MC under the guideline, but conclude\n22\nthat none apply. Specifically, given that I rejected her false-positive claim as an\nexplanation for the 2006 positive drug test, I cannot accept as true Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that she no longer engages in drug abuse.  Accordingly, Guideline H is\n23\ndecided against Applicant. \n\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E and H. Applicant did\nnot meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In\nreaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept (to include her favorable character\nevidence) was given due consideration and it does not support a favorable decision.\nThis case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.d:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, infra. 3 Motion to Amend SOR After Applicant presented her evidence at the hearing, the government moved under \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive to add a new allegation under Guideline B, as follows: d. Your spouse maintains a retirement account in Israel in the approximate amount of $20,000. I granted the motion based on the testimony submitted and the government\u2019s lack of knowledge about the retirement account before the hearing. In response, Applicant recalled her spouse to testify about his reasons for maintaining the account and his intent to withdraw the funds when he can do so without incurring significant financial penalties. Jurisdiction On November 2, 2009, I was notified by DOHA that Applicant had been terminated by her employer on September 4, 2009, due to a reduction in force. During a subsequent conference call with the parties, Applicant indicated that she had been laid off but she was attempting to secure a position with another defense contractor.

Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant immigrated to the United States from what was then the Soviet Union\nin 1978. She moved to Israel with her spouse in 1993 for his academic position, and she\nworked there as a software engineer from 1994 to 1999. She acquired Israeli citizenship\nin 1999 in lieu of having to leave Israel when her temporary residency expired.\nHowever, she returned to the U.S. permanently six months later. Foreign preference\nconcerns are mitigated by the revocation of her Israeli citizenship. Foreign influence\nconcerns raised by her residency and employment in Israel, and by her spouse\u2019s former\nacademic position and his present pension assets in Israel, are mitigated by\ncountervailing strong ties to the U.S. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on April 3, 2007. On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nNovember 24, 2009\n\n2\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C and Guideline B that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny her a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 26, 2009, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On July 10, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for July 29,\n2009.\nAt the hearing, three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and four Applicant exhibits\n(Ex. A-D) were admitted in evidence. Applicant and her spouse testified, as reflected in\na transcript (Tr.) received on August 7, 2009. I also agreed to take administrative notice\nof certain facts pertinent to Israel and its foreign relations, including with the U.S., infra.\nWhile the decision on Applicant\u2019s security eligibility was still pending, I reopened\nthe record on October 30, 2009, at Applicant\u2019s request and with no objection from\nDepartment Counsel. Applicant submitted a document from Israel\u2019s Ministry of the\nInterior, dated October 20, 2009, which was received in evidence as Exhibit E without\nany objections.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn June 25, 2009, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to Israel and its foreign relations, including with the United\nStates (U.S.). The request, which was received on July 6, 2009, was based on\npublications from the U.S. State Department, the Congressional Research Service, the\nNational Counterintelligence Center, the Office of the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive, the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. The government\u2019s formal request and the\nattached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record.\nApplicant was given an opportunity to respond at her hearing, and she did not object to\nmy taking administrative notice. Those facts accepted for administrative notice are set\nforth in the Findings of Fact, infra.\n\n3\nMotion to Amend SOR\nAfter Applicant presented her evidence at the hearing, the government moved\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive to add a new allegation under Guideline B, as follows:\nd. Your spouse maintains a retirement account in Israel in the approximate\namount of $20,000.\nI granted the motion based on the testimony submitted and the government\u2019s lack of\nknowledge about the retirement account before the hearing. In response, Applicant\nrecalled her spouse to testify about his reasons for maintaining the account and his\nintent to withdraw the funds when he can do so without incurring significant financial\npenalties.\n \nJurisdiction\nOn November 2, 2009, I was notified by DOHA that Applicant had been\nterminated by her employer on September 4, 2009, due to a reduction in force. During a\nsubsequent conference call with the parties, Applicant indicated that she had been laid\noff but she was attempting to secure a position with another defense contractor. Under\n\u00b6 4.4. of DoD Directive 5220.6, actions under the Directive are to cease upon\ntermination of an applicant\u2019s need for access to classified information except in certain\nenumerated cases, including where a hearing has commenced (\u00b6 4.4.1). Since\nApplicant\u2019s hearing had been conducted and completed, jurisdiction to determine her\nsecurity eligibility is retained.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that\nApplicant exercised dual citizenship with Israel and the U.S. (SOR 1.a); that she resided\nin Israel from 1993 to 1999 (SOR 1.b) where she worked as a software engineer from\nabout 1994 to 1999 (SOR 1.c); that she sought and obtained Israeli citizenship in 1999\ndespite her naturalization in the U.S. in 1983 (SOR 1.d); and that she was issued\ntemporary travel documents by the Israeli Consulate for travel to Israel (SOR 1.e).\nApplicant\u2019s residency and employment in Israel (SOR 2.a), as well as her travels to\nIsrael in at least April 2001 and August 2005 (SOR 2.c), were alleged as raising\nGuideline B, foreign influence concerns. Additionally, DOHA alleged under Guideline B\nthat Applicant\u2019s spouse, a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S., had a postdoctoral\nfellowship at an Israeli university from about 1993 to 1999 (SOR 2.b), and that he\nmaintains a retirement account worth $20,000 in Israel (SOR 2.d).\nIn her Answer received by DOHA on March 30, 2009, Applicant denied SOR 2.b\nbecause her spouse\u2019s postdoctoral fellowship was from 1993 to 1995. She admitted the\nother allegations, but explained that she had no choice but to obtain Israeli citizenship\nor leave the country. Applicant and her spouse decided to return to the U.S. as soon as\nhe was offered an academic position here. They traveled to Israel only twice thereafter,\n\n4\nfor their son\u2019s bar mitzvah in 2001 and their daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah in 2005, and have\napplied to renounce their Israeli citizenship. After considering the pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old software engineer, who had been employed by a\ndefense contractor from January 2007 until September 2009, when she was apparently\nlaid off due to a reduction in force. She had held an interim secret-level clearance and\nhandled classified information appropriately until her clearance was withdrawn on\nissuance of the SOR (Ex. D, Tr. 22).\nApplicant was born in what was then the Soviet Union in 1964 to Russian\nparents. When she was 13, Applicant and her parents left the Soviet Union. The\ngovernment required that they renounce their Soviet citizenship. In 1978, they\nimmigrated to the U.S. as refugees. In October 1983, Applicant and her parents became\nnaturalized U.S. citizens (Ex. 1). Applicant attended high school and college in the U.S.\n(Ex. C, Tr. 31). In June 1987, she was awarded her master of science degree in\ncomputer science (Ex. 1).\nIn April 1986, Applicant married a native of the Ukraine. He had immigrated to\nthe U.S. from the Soviet Union with his family in 1978 when he was 18, and he attended\ncollege in the U.S., eventually earning his doctorate degree in computer science in 1993\n(Ex. C). Applicant\u2019s spouse acquired his U.S. citizenship in January 1984 (Ex. 1).\nApplicant and her spouse have four children (ages 21, 16, 9, and 6), each of whom are\nU.S. citizens from birth (Exs. 1, C).\nIn October 1993, when their second child was only a few months old, Applicant\nand her spouse went to Israel on a student visa. He had accepted a one-year\npostdoctoral fellowship at a government-owned technological university (Exs. 3, C, Tr.\n54, 66, 101) at the invitation of one of the top scientists in his field (Tr. 32, 66, 101).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse became acquainted with this Israeli academic while he was pursuing\nhis doctorate degree at the U.S. university, and they collaborated on an academic paper\n(Tr. 98-99). At the time, Applicant was working for a U.S. defense contractor on\nunclassified, civil aviation projects. (Tr. 32, 45). She took a year of maternity leave\nrather than quit her job, as they planned to spend only the one year in Israel (Tr. 32).\nAfter her spouse\u2019s fellowship was extended for a second year, Applicant left the employ\nof the U.S. defense contractor and went to work in Israel to help the family\u2019s finances. In\n1994, Applicant and her spouse applied for, and obtained, temporary residency status,\nwhich was valid for three years and required for employment in Israel (Tr. 54). In\nDecember 1994, Applicant commenced employment as a software engineer for a\ncommercial developer of database software for accounting systems (Exs. 1, 3, C, Tr.\n32-33, 42).\nIn 1995, Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s postdoctoral fellowship ended, and he began\nsearching for a permanent teaching position in the U.S. After receiving a few rejection\nletters from U.S. academic institutions, he began to look for work in Israel. He received\njob offers from the few resumes that he sent out, including offers from two large U.S.\n\n5\ncomputer companies. Applicant\u2019s spouse elected to work for a multinational commercial\nmedia company that offered him a higher salary in a research position that allowed him\nto shift emphasis from pure theory to more marketable theoretical application (Tr. 34,\n112-14). Applicant started working for the same company as a software engineer in\nNovember 1995 (Ex. 1, Tr. 64). Their work with the company did not have military or\ngovernment application (Tr. 115). While in Israel, they filed and paid taxes on their\nincome to Israel and the U.S. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55). In 1997, they were granted a one-year\nextension of their temporary residency status in Israel with the understanding that on its\nexpiration, they would have to acquire Israeli citizenship or leave the country (Ex. C, Tr.\n35).\nAs of late 1998, Applicant\u2019s spouse had no success in finding a permanent\nacademic position in the U.S., and their temporary residency was about to expire. They\nneeded employment income to support their children. So, believing they had no\nreasonable alternative, Applicant and her spouse acquired Israeli citizenship in March\n1999 (Exs. 1, 3, C, Tr. 35, 42-44). Israeli citizenship was conferred automatically on\ntheir children when Applicant and his spouse became Israeli citizens. As a result, their\ntwo oldest children became dual citizens of Israel and the U.S. as well (Tr. 51).\nApplicant and her spouse considered the acquisition of Israeli citizenship a bureaucratic\nformality that allowed them to continue working (Ex. C, Tr. 35, 97).  They intended to\nreturn eventually to the U.S., and they sent their children to stay with their parents in the\nU.S. each summer. Their oldest child attended day camp in the U.S. to maintain his\nfluency in English (Tr. 41).\nA few months after they acquired dual citizenship, Applicant\u2019s spouse secured a\ntenure track position at the U.S. university where he had earned his doctorate degree\n(Tr. 81). In September 1999, the family left Israel for the U.S. (Exs. 1, 3, C, Tr. 54).\nSince they had not been citizens of Israel for one year, they were ineligible to apply for\nIsraeli passports. Before they were allowed to leave the country, they had to obtain\nIsraeli travel documents (Tr. 52, 77). These travel documents were valid for one year\n(Tr. 53). Applicant and her spouse gave a friend in Israel (Israeli citizen X) separate\npowers of attorney to deal with their pension funds in Israel (Tr. 57). This friend\nwithdrew the last of Applicant\u2019s pension funds on her behalf in 2008, and her power of\nattorney expired in the summer of 2009 (Tr. 58). Citizen X still holds a valid power of\nattorney for Applicant\u2019s spouse (Tr. 104, 126).\nExcept for a brief period of unemployment in November and December 2000,\nApplicant worked as a software engineer in the U.S. from September 1999 to February\n2003. In April 2001, Applicant and her spouse took the two older of their three children\nto Israel for two weeks for Passover and their son\u2019s bar mitzvah (Tr. 36). Applicant gave\nno thought to renouncing Israeli citizenship because she did not realize that she could\ndo so (Tr. 78). Applicant and her spouse applied for, and obtained, Israeli travel\ndocuments that they used to enter and exit Israel (Exs. 2, 3, Tr. 36, 38, 52-53).\nApplicant understood that as a dual citizen with Israeli citizenship, she would not have\nbeen allowed to enter Israel on her U.S. passport (Tr. 38, 43).  She used her U.S.\npassport when traveling abroad except to enter and exit Israel (Tr. 43, 88).\n\n6\nApplicant was unemployed from February 2003 until October 2005 (Ex. 1).\nDuring this time, she cared for her children, including her youngest, a son born in 2003\nafter the trip to Israel. In August 2005, she and her spouse took their older daughter to\nIsrael for her bat mitzvah. They again obtained travel documents from the Israeli\nConsulate for their trip. Applicant presented her U.S. passport, most recently renewed in\nDecember 2004, on her reentry into the U.S. on September 4, 2005. Her travel\ndocuments from Israel expired in 2006 (Exs. 3, C).\nApplicant had some short-term work from October 2005 to December 2005, and\nfrom February 2006 to May 2006, but she was otherwise unemployed until January\n2007 when she began working for the defense contractor (Ex. 1). On April 3, 2007,\nApplicant completed an e-QIP application for a security clearance. She disclosed that\nshe, her spouse, and their two older children were dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel.\nShe indicated that her two younger children were citizens of the U.S. only. They had\nnever been to Israel (Ex. C, Tr. 45). Applicant also disclosed her previous employment\nin Israel and her travel there in 2001 and 2005 (Ex. 1). Applicant was not told at that\ntime that dual citizenship could pose a problem for her security clearance (Tr. 36).\nOn May 4, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nissues of potential foreign preference. Applicant denied using her Israeli citizenship to\nany advantage, and explained that she applied for the foreign citizenship because it was\nrequired for further employment in Israel. At the time she applied, she had no definite\nplans to return to the U.S. She asserted that the U.S. held her ultimate loyalty. She\nmaintained her Israeli citizenship because she wanted to be able to travel to Israel in\nthe future, and believed she would be unable to do so without her Israeli citizenship (Tr.\n55). Applicant acknowledged she had email contact once every other month with Israeli\ncitizen X, but she denied contacts with other foreign nationals (Ex. 2).\nOn March 26, 2008, Applicant was reinterviewed about her ties to Israel,\nincluding her previous residency and employment, and her acquisition of Israeli\ncitizenship. She reported contact three or four times yearly by telephone or email with\nIsraeli citizen X\u2019s spouse (Israeli citizen Y). Applicant described her affiliation with Israel\nas \u201cpurely religious.\u201d She expressed no objections to renouncing her Israeli citizenship,\nprovided she could continue to vacation there (Ex. 3).\nOn February 20, 2009, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant, in part due to\nconcerns about her dual citizenship with Israel and the U.S. Applicant was told by her\nemployer that she would have to renounce her Israeli citizenship. Applicant inquired and\nwas assured that she would be permitted to travel to Israel for religious reasons\n(younger children\u2019s bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah) and tourism if she gave up her Israeli\ncitizenship (Tr. 56). On or before March 19, 2009, Applicant and her spouse applied to\nrenounce their Israeli citizenship (Exs. A,  B, C, Tr. 49-50) Applicant and her spouse\nsurrendered their Israeli identification cards (Tr. 48) and some expired Israeli travel\ndocuments that they had in their possession at that time (Ex. C. Tr. 43, 47). On October\n20, 2009, Israel\u2019s Ministry of Interior revoked Applicant\u2019s citizenship and the Israeli\n\nThe \u201cConfirmation for the W aiver of Israeli Citizenship\u201d submitted after the hearing and entered as\n1\nExhibit E pertains only to Applicant and her minor children. There is no evidence indicating whether her\nspouse\u2019s application to renounce his Israeli citizenship was likewise approved. There is also a discrepancy\nin the record concerning their children\u2019s citizenship.  Applicant testified the revocation applied to her 16-year-\nold daughter,  who had lived in Israel and acquired Israeli citizenship automatically when Applicant and her\nspouse became Israeli citizens (Tr. 51-52). Applicant\u2019s spouse testified they applied to renounce the Israeli\ncitizenship of their three minor children (both daughters and younger son) (Tr. 128). Applicant has indicated\nthat their two younger children (daughter born in 2000 and son born in 2003) possess only U.S. citizenship\n(Ex. 1).\n7\ncitizenship of their minor children effective October 19, 2009.  They could not apply to\n1\nrevoke the Israeli citizenship of their older son, who is legally an adult. He is a college\nstudent in the U.S. and had not applied to renounce his Israeli citizenship as of late July\n2009 (Tr. 51-52). Applicant\u2019s legal right to reside in Israel expired on March 8, 2009 (Ex.\nE). Applicant has no present plans to travel to Israel in the next couple of years. She\ncould not rule out future travel to Israel for her younger children\u2019s bat mitzvah and bar\nmitzvah (Tr. 56).\nApplicant and her spouse have never owned any real estate in Israel (Tr. 37, 44).\nThey closed their bank accounts when they left the country (Tr. 44, 65). Applicant had\nsome retirement funds from her employment there that Israeli citizen X withdrew for her\nin 2008, when it could be accomplished without tax penalties (Tr. 44, 57). Applicant\u2019s\nspouse has about $20,000 USD in remaining retirement funds in a specialized pension\nplan in Israel from his employment for the commercial company. He plans to have\nIsraeli citizen X withdraw the funds for him, and he will deposit the funds in the U.S. as\nsoon as he can do so without significant tax penalties (Tr. 63, 89, 101-03, 137, 140).\nApplicant and her spouse did not take advantage of certain benefits offered by the\ngovernment of Israel to its citizens, such as subsidized language instruction or a low\ninterest rate mortgage when they were in Israel (Tr. 38-39).\nApplicant contacts Israeli citizens X and Y by telephone or electronic mail every\nfew months (\u201cI would call them or I send them email basically for like birthdays and\nsuch, so every few months.\u201d). (Tr. 43, 58, 105). Both Israeli citizens X and Y are\nemployed as software engineers in the commercial sector in Israel (Tr. 58), and they\nhave two children who are still minors (Tr. 59). Applicant and her family stayed with\nthese friends for the duration of their stay in Israel in 2001, and for the first week of their\ntrip there in 2005 (Tr. 60).  Applicant\u2019s spouse used to play soccer with Israeli citizen X\nwhen they lived in Israel, but their wives share a closer relationship (Tr. 105).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse exchanges email messages every couple of months, primarily of a\nreligious nature, with an Israeli resident citizen (citizen Z) who emigrated from Russia\nand is affiliated with a religious organization prominent among expatriate intellectuals in\nIsrael (Tr. 105-07, 125). Applicant\u2019s spouse had attended some lectures given by this\norganization when he lived in Israel (Tr. 124), and he has assisted with the logistics of\nonce yearly lectures held by this organization in the U.S. (Tr. 106-07, 123-24). Applicant\nhas no ongoing contact with anyone from the Israeli university where he served his\npostdoctoral fellowship (Tr. 107). His last contact was five or six years ago when he was\n\n8\nnotified of the death of the professor who had brought him to the Israeli university (Tr.\n129).\nNeither Applicant nor her spouse has any family in Israel (Tr. 43). Applicant and\nher spouse have been active volunteers in the schools their children attend in the U.S.\nand in their synagogue (Tr. 45).  Denied tenure by the university where he had been on\nstaff since 1999 (Tr. 121), Applicant\u2019s spouse began working for a scientific research\nlaboratory engaged in U.S. defense work in July 2009 (Tr. 92-93, 121). As of July 2009,\nApplicant was still employed in the defense industry. She followed all rules for handling\nand safeguarding classified information when she had access. Having come to know\nher character and strong work ethic, her supervisor recommended her for a security\nclearance, knowing that Applicant had once lived in Israel (Ex. D).\nAfter reviewing the U.S. government publications concerning Israel and its\nforeign relations, including with the U.S., I take administrative notice of the following\nfacts:\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy of about 7.1 million people. Israel generally\nrespects the human rights of its citizens, although there have been some issues\nrespecting treatment of Palestinian detainees and discrimination against Arab citizens.\nDespite the instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel\u2019s relations within the\nregion since it came into existence, Israel has developed a diversified, technologically\nadvanced market economy focused on high-technology electronic and biomedical\nequipment, chemicals, and transport equipment.\nThe United States and Israel have a close friendship based on common\ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. The U.S. was the first\ncountry to officially recognize Israel, only eleven minutes after Israel declared its\nindependence in 1948. In 1985, Israel and the U.S. concluded a Free Trade Agreement\ndesigned to strengthen economic ties by eliminating tariffs. The U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest\ntrading partner. As of 2007, 35% of Israel\u2019s exports went to the U.S., while 13.9% of its\nimports came from the U.S. Israel is a prominent recipient of U.S. aid. Since 1949, the\nU.S. has provided more than $30 billion in economic assistance to Israel. Between 1976\nand 2003, Israel was the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The U.S. has also\nprovided Israel with $9 billion in loan guarantees since 2003, which enable Israel to\nborrow money from commercial lenders at a lower rate. The U.S. and Israel established\nin April 1988 a Joint Economic Development Group to develop the Israeli economy by\nexchanging views of Israel economic policy planning, stabilization efforts, and structural\nreform.\nIsrael and the U.S. do not have a mutual defense agreement, although the U.S.\nremains committed to Israel\u2019s security and well-being. The U.S. is the principal\ninternational proponent of the Arab-Israeli peace process, and has been actively\ninvolved in negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1989, Israel was one\nof the first countries designated a Major Non-NATO ally. As such, Israel receives\npreferential treatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and access to expanded\n\n9\nweapons systems at lower prices. Israel and the U.S. are partners in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d\nmissile defense project, and have concluded numerous treaties and agreements aimed\nat strengthening military ties, including agreements on mutual defense assistance,\nprocurement, and security of information. Israel and the U.S. have established joint\ngroups to further military cooperation. The two countries participate in joint military\nexercises and collaborate on military research and weapons development. The U.S. has\npledged to ensure that Israel maintains a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over its neighbors,\nand has been a major source of Israeli military funding. The Omnibus Appropriations\nAct of March 11, 2009, provided $2.38 billion in foreign military financing for Israel.\nStrong congressional support for Israel has resulted in Israel receiving benefits not\navailable to other countries. Israel is permitted to use one-quarter of its foreign military\nassistance grant for procurement spending from Israeli defense companies.\nArms agreements between Israel and the U.S. limit the use of U.S. military\nequipment to defensive purposes. The U.S. has acted to restrict aid and/or rebuked\nIsrael in the past for possible improper use of U.S.-supplied military equipment. The\nU.S. is concerned about Israeli settlements; Israel\u2019s sales of sensitive security\nequipment and technology, especially to China; Israel\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S.\nintellectual property; Israel\u2019s suspected use of U.S.-made cluster bombs against civilian\npopulated areas in Lebanon; and espionage-related cases implicating Israeli officials.\nIsraeli military officials have been implicated in economic espionage activity in the U.S.\nIsrael was listed as one of the nations that aggressively targeted U.S. economic\nintelligence as recently as 2000.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n10\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the U.S. AG \u00b6 9. Applicant became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen at age 19, having immigrated to the U.S. from what was then the Soviet Union in\n1978. In 1993, she went to Israel with her spouse on a student visa when he accepted a\npostdoctoral fellowship at a government-owned technological university. After his\nfellowship was extended for a second year, she sought and obtained temporary\nresidency status for employment in Israel (SOR 1.b), and she began working as a\nsoftware engineer in Israel in December 1994 (SOR 1.c). When she could extend that\nstatus no further, she obtained Israeli citizenship in March 1999 (SOR 1.a, 1.d).\nApplicant\u2019s voluntary acquisition of Israeli citizenship raises significant foreign\npreference concerns. See AG \u00b6 10(b) (stating, \u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of\na foreign citizenship by an American citizen\u201d). Furthermore, since her Israeli citizenship\nallowed her to maintain her residency and employment in Israel, AG \u00b6 10(a)(5),\n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not\nlimited to: (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in\nanother country,\u201d is also implicated.\nApplicant traveled to Israel twice, in 2001 and 2005, after she returned to the\nU.S. permanently in September 1999. For those trips, she acquired temporary Israeli\n\n11\ntravel documents that permitted her to enter and exit Israel (SOR 1.e). Her use of these\nforeign travel documents served as the functional equivalent of an Israeli passport in her\nentry to and exiting from Israel on those occasions. Since Applicant never acquired a\nforeign passport, AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport,\u201d does not\napply. However, she actively exercised her Israeli citizenship in preference to her U.S.\ncitizenship under AG \u00b6 10(1) when she presented those foreign travel documents for\nadmission to Israel.\nApplicant had some retirement assets in Israel from her work with a multinational\ncommercial company, but she withdrew those funds. Similarly, her oldest son attended\nthe local school when they were in Israel but there is no indication that she is currently\nreceiving any benefits from Israel of the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) (stating,\n\u201caccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a\nforeign country\u201d).\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d applies. After being informed by\nher security officer at work that she would have to give up her foreign citizenship, she\nfiled her application to renounce promptly in March 2009, and her Israeli citizenship was\nrevoked, effective October 19, 2009. While renunciation of foreign citizenship is not\nstrictly required for access to classified information, the U.S. government does not\nencourage its citizens to remain dual nationals because of the complications that might\nensue from obligations owed to the foreign country. Applicant\u2019s renunciation of her\nforeign citizenship provides substantial assurances that she can be counted on to\ncomply with DoD requirements.\nApplicant has no plans to travel to Israel in the near future, although she is likely\nto take her younger children (daughter age 9 and son age 6) to Israel for their\nrespective bat mitzvah and bar mitzvah. During her initial interview in May 2007,\nApplicant indicated she did not want to renounce her Israeli citizenship because she\nwanted to travel to Israel. In March 2008, Applicant expressed no objections to giving up\nher Israeli citizenship, provided that she could continue to travel there. But any future\ntravel to Israel will be on her U.S. passport. Since she is no longer a citizen of Israel, the\nneed for Israeli travel documents no longer exists. Applicant has demonstrated a clear\npreference for the U.S. by renouncing her Israeli citizenship. Her conduct in the last ten\nyears has been largely consistent with her U.S. citizenship. Based on all the\ncircumstances, the foreign preference concerns are mitigated.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\n\n12\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s residency in Israel from October 1993 to September 1999, and her\nemployment there from December 1994 until September 1999, were alleged as raising\nforeign influence concerns (SOR 2.a). Living and working in a foreign country may raise\nthe potential for foreign influence because of professional and personal contacts\nestablished during the residency and employment. There is nothing about Applicant\u2019s\nemployment in Israel, which ended some ten years ago and was commercial in nature,\nthat raises concerns under AG \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d\nHowever, during her years in Israel, Applicant established personal friendships\nwith Israeli couple, citizens X and Y, that were sufficiently close for her and her spouse\nto give citizen X separate powers of attorney to handle the withdrawals of their\nrespective retirement accounts in Israel. Applicant\u2019s contacts with these Israeli citizens\noccur every few months, but the timing around birthdays suggests close personal\nrelations, despite her characterization of the contacts as not very close (Tr. 43).\nMoreover, when Applicant traveled to Israel in 2001 and again in 2005 (SOR 2.c), she\nstayed at least part of the time at the couple\u2019s home. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies.\nThere is no evidence of conduct by Applicant during her trips to Israel in 2001\nand 2005 that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i), \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the\nU.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by\na foreign person, group, government, or country,\u201d with the exception of the use of the\nIsraeli travel documents to enter and exit Israel. The security implications raised by her\ncompliance with this obligation of Israeli citizenship were appropriately covered under\nGuideline C.\nAdditional foreign influence concerns were alleged related to her spouse\u2019s dual\ncitizenship, his postdoctoral fellowship at the government-owned technological\nuniversity in Israel (SOR 2.b) and his pension assets of about $20,000 in Israel from his\nformer employment with the multinational media company (SOR 2.d). AG \u00b6 7(d) applies\nif these spousal ties to Israel create a heightened risk. See AG \u00b6 7(d) (stating, \u201csharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion\u201d). Certainly from 1993 to 1995, there was a significant risk of undue foreign\n\nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that he maintains ties with an Israeli citizen who is prominent in a\n2\nreligious organization in Israel. The government could have amended the SOR to allege this conduct and did\nnot do so. Presumably, the government accepted his explanation that the nature of their contacts was religious\nin nature and did not pose an unacceptable risk.\n13\ninfluence because of her spouse\u2019s fellowship at the university. He was invited to Israel\nby a preeminent scientist in their field, with whom he had collaborated in the U.S. when\nhe was pursuing his doctorate degree. But Applicant\u2019s spouse testified, with no rebuttal\nfrom the government, that his last contact with anyone from the university was about\nfive or six years ago, when he was notified of the death of the professor who had\nbrought him to the university (Tr. 129). As for his dual citizenship status, Applicant\u2019s\nspouse applied to renounce his Israeli citizenship in March 1999. Applicant submitted\nevidence showing that hers and her minor children\u2019s citizenship had been renounced.\nThere is no evidence showing final action, if any, taken on her spouse\u2019s request.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that the Israeli Consulate gave him no reason to believe his\nrequest to renounce Israeli citizenship would be denied (Tr. 122), but I cannot presume\nthat his Israeli citizenship has been revoked. Their older son has taken no action to\nrevoke his dual citizenship. Her spouse\u2019s pension asset in Israel heightens the risk of\nundue influence somewhat; although it is primarily because of the tie to Israeli  citizen X\nthrough the power of attorney rather than the value of the asset. Considering that all of\ntheir other assets are in the U.S., the $20,000 remaining in retirement funds in Israel,\nwhich her spouse intends to withdraw and bring to the U.S., is not a substantial foreign\nasset. Under the circumstances, AG \u00b6 7(e), \u201ca substantial business, financial, or\nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated\nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d does not apply. However, AG \u00b6 7(d) is implicated.2\nApplicant\u2019s relationships with her family members, who all reside in the U.S., are\nunderstandably closer than her ties to her friends in Israel. Yet, it is difficult to fully\nsatisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Israel and the U.S. have a\nclose friendship. The U.S. is committed to Israel\u2019s security, to the extent of ensuring that\nIsrael maintains a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d in the region. Israel receives preferential\ntreatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and substantial economic aid from the\nU.S. Yet the interests of even the closest of allies are not always completely aligned.\nThe U.S. is concerned about Israeli settlements, Israel\u2019s military sales to China,\nIsrael\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related cases\nimplicating Israeli officials. Israeli military officials have been implicated in economic\nespionage activity in the U.S. Israel was listed as one of the nations that aggressively\ntargeted U.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000. Her spouse\u2019s and older son\u2019s\nU.S. citizenship and residency reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of undue foreign\ninfluence that exists because of their Israeli citizenship. While Israeli resident citizens X\n\n14\nand Y are employed as software engineers in the commercial sector, I cannot apply\neither AG \u00b6 8(a) or AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communications with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d to those relationships as long as Israeli citizen X holds a valid\npower of attorney over her spouse\u2019s pension funds in Israel.\nBut the weight of the evidence supports AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant has\nconsistently maintained that her allegiance lies with the U.S., and that she had no\nrealistic alternative to obtaining Israeli citizenship. Applicant and her spouse could have\nreturned to the U.S. after his fellowship ended in 1995, but it is not clear whether they\ncould have financially afforded to do so. By 1999, they had worked for the multinational\ncorporation in Israel for a few years, long enough to earn significant pension assets.\nPresumably, they were in a better position money-wise, even if they did not have\nemployment opportunities in the U.S. Applicant has not persuaded me that she was\nwithout options. But even then, her decision to acquire Israeli citizenship was for\neconomic considerations. She was not motivated by political affiliation or preference for\nIsrael. It was only after she was denied a further extension of her temporary residency\nin Israel that she applied for Israeli citizenship.\nSix months after they were granted Israeli citizenship, Applicant and her spouse\nmoved their family back to the U.S. where they pursued a lifestyle largely consistent\nwith their U.S. citizenship. While they obtained travel documents from Israel in 2001 and\n2005, they had no choice if they wanted to enter Israel. All other foreign travel was on\nU.S. passports. They stayed with Israeli citizens X and Y when in Israel, but their\nprimary purpose was to celebrate their son\u2019s bar mitzvah and daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah.\nApplicant was unaware at that time that she could have applied to renounce her Israeli\ncitizenship. This was evident also in May 2007, when she was asked whether she would\nbe willing to renounce her foreign citizenship, as she replied she did not know whether it\nwas possible. Applicant made no effort following that interview to inquire about the\npossibility of renouncing her Israeli citizenship, but she also had no reason to believe\nthat she would be required to do so for her clearance. After she was told by her\nemployer to give up her Israeli citizenship, she and her spouse followed through\npromptly by filing their applications to renounce through the Israeli Consulate. Their\nacquisition of travel documents rather than Israeli passports, and certainly their efforts\nto renounce Israeli citizenship, confirm their bonds to the U.S., where they have spent\nnot only the last ten years, but the majority of their lives. Had either Applicant or her\nspouse any intent to return permanently to Israel, it is unlikely that they would have\napplied to renounce their Israeli citizenship, or that Applicant would have brought all of\nher pension assets from Israel to the U.S. \nApplicant and her family members are firmly rooted in the U.S. All enjoy the\nprotections of U.S. citizenship and residency. Their older son retains dual citizenship\n\n15\nwith Israel and the U.S., but he attends college in the U.S. Applicant and her spouse\nhave been active in their children\u2019s schools. Her spouse testified credibly that he intends\nto bring the $20,000 left of his pension funds in Israel to the U.S. They never voted in\nIsrael or acquired real estate in Israel. Their connection to Israel is largely religious at\nthis point.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the\ntotality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign country or foreign national and the interests of the U.S. Applicant had\nconsiderable personal ties to Israel from 1993 to 1999, where she lived and worked as a\ntemporary resident from 1994 until March 1999, and for the last six months of her stay\nas a citizen. In the past ten years, the exercise of her foreign citizenship has been\nlimited to obtaining legally required travel documents so that she could travel to Israel\nfor her son\u2019s bar mitzvah and then her daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah. Applicant expressed\nreluctance in 2008 over relinquishing the citizenship tie to Israel out of concern for\nwhether she could vacation there, and whether she would be permitted to take her\nyounger children there for similar religious purposes. \nFuture travel to Israel by Applicant to celebrate these religious occasions is seen\nas likely, and during those visits, Applicant may well visit or even stay with Israeli\nresident citizens X and Y. But Applicant asserted a clear preference for the U.S. by\nrenouncing her Israeli citizenship. Future trips to Israel will be on her U.S. passport. The\nfriendship and religious ties to Israel that she maintains are minimal when compared to\nher U.S. interests and do not now warrant denial of her clearance eligibility.\n\n16\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the amended SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 30, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz,\nJr. granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge improperly\nshifted the burden of persuasion to the government; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the\ngovernment had presented no evidence of heightened risk under Guideline B; whether the Judge\nerred in concluding that the government had failed to meet its burden of production under Guideline\nB; and whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent mitigating conditions was error.  For the\nreasons set forth below, we remand the case to the Judge.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was raised and educated\nin the U.S.S.R., receiving a degree in computer science.  She married a U.S.S.R. citizen, with whom\nshe had a daughter, and divorced him four years later.  While living in the U.S.S.R. she worked for\ngovernment-controlled companies.  She immigrated to the U.S. in the early 1990s, along with her\ndaughter.  She renounced her U.S.S.R. citizenship, surrendered her property interests to the\ngovernment, and paid the government six months salary.  In the mid-1990s she became a U.S.\ncitizen.  \nApplicant married a retired officer of the U.S. Army.  Her new husband adopted her daughter.\nShe subsequently divorced this second husband.  Applicant has obtained a Master\u2019s Degree from a\nU.S. university and works for a federal contractor.  Her job requires her to travel extensively.  \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Russia.  He is retired from the military.  She\ncontacts him once a year.  Both of Applicant\u2019s parents are dead.  Her first ex-husband is a citizen and\nresident of Russia.  She contacts him as often as six times a year to keep him apprised of his\ndaughter, with whom he has no contact.  Applicant contacts her former mother-in-law, a citizen and\nresident of Russia, about four times a year, and she contacts two friends, both of whom are citizens\nand residents of Russia, about four times a year.  She has traveled several times to Russia, most\nrecently to pay respects to her father\u2019s grave.  \nRussia has been a target of terrorist activity in recent years.  Russian federal forces, in pursing\nterrorists, engage in torture, summary executions, disappearances, and arbitrary detentions.  Russia\nhas an active, significant, recent, and ongoing intelligence collection program.  As of 2005 Russia\nwas one of the two most aggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and\n\n3\naccounted for much of such targeting.  Russia is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judges findings.  However, consideration of the\nassigned errors requires the Board to address the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings about the\ngeopolitical situation in Russia.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that the government had failed to present substantial evidence of a\nsecurity concern under Guideline B.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s foreign travel to Russia has no independent\nsecurity significance.  Her contacts with her ex-husband, former mother-in-law, and two\nfriends\u2013none of whom is connected to the Russian government\u2013are minimal.  Her contacts with her\nbrother\u2013now still tenuously connected to the government through his retirement\u2013is virtually non-\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.7(a): \u201ccontact with a foreign family member . . . or other person who is a citizen of or\n1\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.7(b): \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information[.]\u201d\n4\nexistent.  Department Counsel has articulated no sensible reason I should consider either as a\npotential source of influence on Applicant.\u201d  Decision at 5.  Department Counsel argues that the\nJudge erred in his analysis, in that he examined the government\u2019s evidence in a piecemeal fashion\nrather than as a whole.  Department Counsel contends that the presence in Russia of a close relative\nsuch as a brother; regular and frequent contact with her former in-laws and her friends; her regular\nvisits to Russia; and Russia\u2019s status a nation with a problematic human rights record that actively\nseeks U.S. intelligence, viewed as a whole, are sufficient to raise a Foreign Influence security\nconcern.   The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.  \n1\nThe Board also notes certain events which have occurred since the close of the record and\nwhich have a bearing on this case.  In August 2008 Russia attacked Georgia.  See President\u2019s\n\u201cRemarks on the Situation in Georgia,\u201d August 18, 2008:  \u201cIt now appears that an effort may be\nunderway to depose Georgia\u2019s duly elected Government.  Russia has invaded a sovereign\nneighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people.\u201d   See also Joint\nStatement on Georgia by Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United\nStates and the United Kingdom, Department of State Media Note, August 27, 2008: \u201cRussia\u2019s\nrecognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazai violates the territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to U.N. Security Council Resolutions supported by Russia.\nRussia\u2019s decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the Caucasus.\u201d\nFor a discussion of official notice in DOHA proceedings, see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 2-4 (App.\nBd. Apr. 12, 2007).   \nA current and accurate assessment of the \u201cgeopolitical situation\u201d and the\n\u201csecurity/intelligence profile of the country vis-a-vis the United states\u201d is crucial in Guideline B\ncases.  See ADP Case No. 06-14978 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 11, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007).  In this case, Applicant has regular contact with citizens of a country that\nhas engaged in armed conflict with a democracy friendly with the U.S.  See U.S. Department of State\nBackground Note: Georgia, February 2008.  This is a matter bearing on the Guideline B security\nconcern, which requires consideration of the nature of the foreign country.  The Board concludes that\nthe best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge with instruction that he reopen the record,\nallow the parties an opportunity to proffer appropriate documents for official notice pertinent to the\ncurrent geopolitical situation in Russia, or other relevant and material evidence, and allow the parties\nto reargue the case.  The other issues in the case are not ripe for consideration at this time.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.     \nSigned: Michael Y.

In June 2009, I reopened\nthe record to permit the parties to augment the record consistent with the board\u2019s ruling.\nI gave the parties until 26 June 2009 to submit additional relevant and material evidence\nconsistent with the Appeal Board\u2019s ruling. Each side made a timely submission, to which\nthe opposing side made no objection.\nFindings of Fact\nExcept as noted below or modified by the Appeal Board, I incorporate by\nreference my previous findings of fact from my 30 June 2008 decision [attached]. I note\nthat Department Counsel did not dispute my findings of fact on appeal. The Appeal\nBoard remand goes only to the sufficiency of my findings about the geopolitical situation\nin Russia.\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\nIn so doing, she provided updated documents for official notice, and objected to my consideration of the\n1\ndocuments submitted by Department Counsel as being outdated. I overrule the objection because the issue\nraised goes only to the weight to be given the government\u2019s documents.\n2\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions establish that she has not traveled to\nRussia since November 2007, and has no intention to do so in the future. She also\nestablished that relations between Russia and Georgia were much more stable than in\nAugust 2008.1\nRussia\u2014a former Soviet Republic\u2014is a nominal democracy with a mixed human\nrights record. It has been the target of terrorist activity in recent years. Russian federal\nforces pursuing terrorists act with impunity while engaging in torture, summary\nexecutions, disappearances, and arbitrary detentions. Additional problems include\ncorruption, media suppression, life-threatening prison conditions, and corruption in law\nenforcement.\nRussia imposes rigid visa requirements on foreign travelers entering, and\ntraveling within, Russia. U.S. citizens who have at one time held Russian citizenship\nmay be required to renounce Russian citizenship before applying for a Russian visa in\ntheir U.S. passport. Unless a Russian citizen has formally renounced his or her Russian\ncitizenship, he or she risks being considered a Russian citizen and not allowed to depart\nexcept on a Russian passport.\nRussia has an active, significant, recent, and ongoing collection program\nfocusing on the U.S. As of 2005, Russia was one of the two most aggressive collectors\nof sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounted for much of such targeting.\nMuch of Russia\u2019s targeting occurs through direct visits to U.S. facilities. However, the\nrecord does not indicate if Russia targets U.S. citizens through family members residing\nin Russia to obtain protected information. Furthermore, the U.S. and Russia cooperate\nover a broad spectrum of foreign-policy issues, particularly counter-terrorism efforts.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n3\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness to protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable\ndoubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n3\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target expatriates who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.4\nIn this case, the Appeal Board has directed me to find that the government\nestablished a case for disqualification under Guideline B, and I so find. However, the\nAppeal Board did so in part by considering events (the Russian incursion into the former\nSoviet Republic of Georgia in August 2008) that not only occurred after the record in\nthis case closed, but after the decision was issued. Nevertheless, considering the\ncountry involved, Russia and the U.S. enjoy competitive foreign relations, although they\ncooperate on a wide variety of issues. While Russia is actively engaged in the collection\nof U.S. information, there is still no evidence suggesting that it targets its expatriate\ncitizens such that would make Applicant or her family members likely targets for\n\n4\ncoercion, duress, or influence. However, for the sake of this analysis, I will assume that\nit does.\nThe Appeal Board also directed me to engage in a current and accurate\nassessment of the \u201cgeopolitical situation\u201d and the \u201csecurity/intelligence profile\u201d of Russia\nvis-a-vis the U.S. It is axiomatic that such assessments are essential in a Guideline B\ncase, but as the Appeal Board infers, such assessments are necessarily fluid. Yet, if I\ntake the Appeal Board decision to its logical conclusion, I should be scanning today\u2019s\nheadlines for evidence of dramatic shifts in the international political landscape.\nFortunately, this case can be resolved without such speculation.\nDespite a softening of relations with Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet\nUnion, and greater collaboration on some issues in the wake of 9/11, Russian\ngeopolitical imperatives remain largely unchanged from those of the Soviet Union,\npossibly even from those of Czarist Russia. Two of the most important geopolitical goals\nhave been obtaining and maintaining access to a warm-water port on the Black Sea\nand\u2014because of the absence of natural defensive barriers on the Russian\nplain\u2014maintenance of a sphere of influence in neighboring states, whether through\nallied Soviet Republics or buffer states sympathetic to Russian interests.\nThe Russian incursion into Georgia establishes that which is not seriously in\ncontention: That Russia will act with armed force when it perceives that such force is\nnecessary to protect its geopolitical interests. Russia did so in Hungary and then-\nCzechoslovakia when Russia was part of the Soviet Union. It is no great surprise that it\ndid so in Georgia. It would not be a great surprise if it did so in any of the other former\nSoviet Republics that have tried to establish closer ties with the West. The only real\ndifference, is that in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia\nlacked both the political cohesiveness and the military power to pursue those\ngeopolitical goals. Russia lacks them no more. Thus, Russia may be expected to move\nto pull its former republics back into its orbit, whether by peaceful means (supporting\npro-Russia candidates in Ukraine), aggressive economic actions (cutting natural gas\ntransmission to Ukraine), or military force (Georgia).\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, I find\u2014in accord with the Appeal Board\u2019s\nruling\u2014that the government established that there was a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of her contacts in\nRussia. However, Applicant\u2019s foreign travel to Russia has no independent security\nsignificance, particularly the two most recent trips to bury her mother and visit her\nfather\u2019s grave. That travel, unlikely to be repeated, serves only to demonstrate her ties\nto two people who are beyond the reach of Russia as focal points for influencing\nApplicant.\nHer contacts with her ex-husband, former mother-in-law, and two friends\u2014none\nof whom is connected to the Russian government\u2014are minimal. Her contacts with her\nbrother\u2014now still tenuously connected to the government through his retirement\u2014are\nvirtually non-existent. Department Counsel has articulated no reasonable argument why\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\n5\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b) connections to\na foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividuals\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a\nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\n6\nwhich these persons are located or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individuals sense\n7\nof obligation to the foreign group is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S. that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or\n8\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n5\nI should consider any of these contacts as potential sources of influence on Applicant.\nEven with Russia\u2019s active information gathering, not every contact born of civility (ex-\nhusband), friendship (her two friends), or family connection (ex-mother-in-law, brother)\nrises to the level of security concerns, particularly given the infrequency of contact.\nApplicant\u2019s 10-year work history in the U.S.S.R.\u2014nearly 30 years removed\u2014was with\nthe Soviet government only in the broadest possible sense, and insignificant as a\nsource for security concerns. There is no possible reason to think Applicant could be\ninfluenced by a government she renounced nearly 30 years ago.\nEven finding a case for disqualification under \u00b6\u00b6 7.(a) and (b), I find the security\nconcerns mitigated.  Applicant fled Russia for a better life with her daughter. In so\n5\ndoing, she renounced her Russian citizenship, became a stateless person, and\nimmigrated to the U.S. for political asylum. Her family and friends are not so situated as\nto be a likely source of pressure.  Her loyalty to the U.S. is so great, and her disdain for\n6\nRussia so palpable, that there is no conflict of interest that can be exploited.  Finally,\n7\nthere is no reasonable characterization of her contacts with family and friends in Russia\nas other than casual and infrequent.  In addition, the U.S. Government has already\n8\nsignificantly vouched for her character, having authorized her to be issued an official\npassport with which to carry out her contract work for the government. I conclude that it\nis unlikely she can be pressured based on her limited contacts with her family and\nfriends in Russia. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant. Consideration of the\nnine \u201cwhole person\u201d factors lead to the same result.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\n   Paragraph 1.

On September 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF, G and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on December 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January\n13, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 4, 2009. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-18), which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit any Exhibits at the hearing. I\nheld the record open until February 13, 2009, so that Applicant could submit\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n2\ndocuments. The submissions were timely received, marked as (AE A-C) and entered\ninto the record. Department Counsel did not object to the documents. DOHA received\nthe transcript on February 13, 2009. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 20, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 2.c. of the SOR. He denied the other allegations,\nincluding \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. and \u00b6\u00b6 3a.-3.d of the SOR. He provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in June 1995. He served in the United States Army (USA) from 1995 until\n2005. He has worked for his current employer since 2005 (GE 1). Applicant is currently\nattending college classes toward his degree. Applicant held a security clearance during\nhis military career (Tr. 23).\nIn 1997, Applicant received an Article 15 for a false report on a sensitive item\n(GE 14). The sensitive item was his protective mask in his carrier. He received a call\nfrom his warrant officer early in the day. Applicant believed he had his protective mask\nin his case. However, when an inspection was made in a few hours, the mask was not\nin the carrier (Tr. 26). The officer told him that he lied but Applicant denied lying.\nApplicant also reported that they did not get along (Tr. 26). The report reflects that no\nadverse action was recommended by the commander (GE 13). Applicant does not deny\nreceiving the Article 15 but denies that he intentionally gave false information to his\nwarrant officer. \nIn 1999, Applicant married. He and his wife separated shortly thereafter and they\ndivorced in 2005. He is currently single and has no children (Tr. 22). \nIn September 2001, Applicant was issued an Article 15 and received\nadministrative punishment, which included 45 days restriction and extra duty for 45 days\n(GE 11). This followed his arrest for a charge of indecent assault. Applicant explained\nthat he denied this allegation for indecent assault because he believes the investigation\nwas terminated because the victim had accused six other individuals of the same\nincident (Tr. 27). He stated he received this administrative punishment for disrespect.\nHe claimed the FBI report was incorrect (GE 11). He believes the investigation was\nterminated (GE 12). He also understood that the case was dismissed (Tr. 27).\n.\nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts, including a vehicle repossession. The\ntotal amount of debt that Applicant owes is approximately $16,000 (GE 3 and GE 4).\nThe largest debt ($10,743) is a vehicle repossession that occurred when Applicant was\nbarred from the base for 10 months. He was not working and could not pay the car loan\n(Tr. 28).\n \n\n3\nApplicant initially denied owing the debts listed in the SOR. At the hearing,\nApplicant admitted the delinquent debt. Applicant has paid one account through debt\nconsolidation \u00b6 1.b (AE B). The other debts have not been paid. \nApplicant obtained the services of a debt consolidation program last year for his\nother debts not included in the SOR. He paid $535 each month (Tr. 29). He completed\nthat plan (AE B). The debt in the SOR for the vehicle repossession is still unpaid (Tr.\n31). Applicant thought that the debt consolidators tried to locate the account but the\nrepossessors would not work with them (Tr. 30). He is trying to track down the debt in\n1.a for $5,319 which has been sold several times. This account has been delinquent\nsince 1998. \nApplicant earns a good salary in his present position. He has discretionary\nincome after his expenses. He is paying on his current car loan.\nIn April 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty,\nsentenced to 10 days in jail (9 days suspended pending completion of DUI counseling,\netc) and fined $1,197. On or about November 4, 2004, the Court issued a warrant for\nhis arrest and failure to appear with proof of completion of DUI counseling, and ordered\nhim to serve an additional 9 days in jail (GE 6).\nApplicant denied this allegation in his answer to the SOR, but at the hearing he\nadmitted to the arrest and charge for DUI. He insisted that he did not know about the\nfailure to appear. He claimed he did not receive anything that instructed him to report\nback. He completed the DUI counseling and believed that the certificate of completion\nwas mailed to the correct party (Tr. 33). Applicant emphasized that his was a mistake in\njudgment by driving (GE 2).\nOn July 2, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Reckless\nDriving. On October 13, 2004, he was found guilty of Reckless Driving, sentenced to 10\ndays in jail (10 days suspended), fined $455, and placed on 12 months unsupervised\nprobation (GE 7 and GE 8). \nApplicant admitted that he was arrested, but denied that he was intoxicated (Tr.\n33).  He explained that the officer did not show him the Breathalyzer report. The police\nofficer had stopped his vehicle because it was drifting from the lane delineation line and\nthe bike lane to the road edge. Applicant admitted that he had two beers earlier in the\nevening (Tr. 36). He is still adamant that he was wrongfully accused of the DUI because\nhe was seen leaving a bar after picking up some coworkers (GE 2).\nOn May 19, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. On August 17,\n2005, he was found guilty of DUI, sentenced to 10 days in jail (9 days suspended) and\nfined $1,272 (GE 10). Applicant admitted this allegation. He explained that he went to a\nbar after a day of being \u201cbelittled at work.\u201d He reported that the bartender gave him\nmore alcohol than he realized. He explained that the alcohol (2 drinks) contained the\nalcohol of six or seven drinks (GE 2).\n\n4\nOn or about June 30, 2005, Applicant was discharged from the Army due to\nmisconduct (the basis was the 2005 DUI). He received a discharge under other than\nhonorable conditions (GE 15 and GE 16). Applicant denied this allegation in the SOR\nbut admitted at the hearing. He was successful in having his discharge upgraded. The\ndischarge was changed on April 2008 after an application, dated March 2007. Applicant\nnow has a discharge \u201cUnder Honorable Conditions\u201d (General) AE A).\nApplicant completed interrogatories in April 2008. He admits to currently drinking\nbut rarely (Tr. 37). He estimates that he drinks two beers a month. The alcohol makes\nhim drowsy (GE 2). He does not drink to the point of intoxication and he does not drink\nalcohol prior to or during work hours. He still disputes that he was intoxicated on July 2,\n2004. There are inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s description of events and the officer\u2019s\nreports. \nApplicant is a team player in his current position. He has shown dedication and\nprofessionalism in the workplace. He is punctual and works very hard. He is highly\nrecommended for a security clearance by his manager. His manager knows about\nApplicant\u2019s history and believes there is no reason he should not have a security\nclearance (AE C). \nApplicant\u2019s evaluations rate him as \u201cfar exceeds\u201d or \u201cexceeds most\u201d in all\ncategories. He contributes to a high customer satisfaction and effective team\nperformance. He has an in-depth knowledge of the mission and technical performance.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on several accounts,\nincluding a vehicle repossession and did not meet some of his financial obligations from\n1998 until the present time. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\naccumulated some delinquent debt and the debt has remained for a period of time. He\npaid one account listed in the SOR ($1,823) through debt consolidation but this does\nnot remove security concerns or doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment. This potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has been\nsteadily employed since leaving the military. He did experience separation and divorce\nbut the debt does not stem from that situation. Applicant was unemployed for a period\nand his car was repossessed. Applicant was not as aggressive as he should have been\nin initially addressing or resolving his delinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20\u00a9. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid one small account. I find his efforts are\ninsufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude this potentially mitigating\ncondition partially applies.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c22\u00a9 \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\n\n7\nIn this case, Applicant has three arrests for DUI. The first DUI was April 28, 2004.\nAfter that, on July 2, 2004, Applicant was arrested for DUI and reckless driving. On May\n19, 2005, Applicant was found guilty of DUI. Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (a) applies.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\u00a9 the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant had three DUIs in a short period of time in 2004, and then again a year\nlater in 2005. Applicant completed an alcohol education program. He was not diagnosed\nas an alcohol dependent or as an abuser. He never received an evaluation and was\ncredible in that he now drinks rarely. Applicant has a very good work record with his\ncurrent employer. He is recommended for his fine work. Applicant does not want alcohol\nto ruin his life. He values his work and now admits that he made mistakes. His drinking\nis moderate (2 beers monthly). The alcohol-related incidents are almost four years old.\nApplicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), and (b). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n8\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline, and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant denied the underlying conduct in each of the allegations under personal\nconduct. He admitted that he did receive the April 23, 1997, Article 15 for a false report\non a sensitive item. He also admitted at the hearing that he received an Article 15 on\nSeptember 23, 2001 but that it was not for indecent assault. He acknowledged the\nadministrative punishment that he received for these two incidents. Applicant was\ninitially discharged from the Army in June 2005 due to misconduct under other than\nhonorable conditions. \nAs for the cross allegations concerning his alcohol consumption, Applicant\ninitially denied the three incidents, but made clear at the hearing that he admitted the\nactual incidents but denied the underlying issue of intoxication in allegation 2.b.\nApplicant acknowledged at the hearing that he made mistakes in judgment by driving on\nthe two occasions.\nApplicant\u2019s Article 15s are not recent. In fact one is more than ten years old. He\nhas had an upgrade to his discharge. He has had no more alcohol-related incidents. His\ndischarge has been changed. I find that under mitigating condition 17\u00a9 \u201cthe offense is\nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d that Applicant has\nmitigated the personal conduct concerns. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\n\n9\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must\nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are not sufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant served in the USA for many years and\nheld a security clearance. While in the military he had some incidents that resulted in\nArticle 15 administrative punishments. He was discharged in 2005 for misconduct\n(based on the alcohol incident) under other than honorable conditions.\nApplicant was charged with three DUIs (2004-2005). He admitted his mistakes in\njudgment, except for the second one. He is adamant that he was not intoxicated. He\nhas not had any other alcohol-related incidents. He drinks rarely. He completed his\nalcohol education and unsupervised probation. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts. He paid one debt alleged in the SOR\nthrough a debt consolidation plan. He still has $16,000 in delinquent debt. The largest is\nfor the vehicle repossession. He is attempting to track down the collection company. He\ndid have some unemployment when he was barred from the base, but he has not been\naggressive with his delinquent debts. He is working steadily and is highly\nrecommended for a security clearance. However, at this time, Applicant has not met his\nburden of proof to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has worked, with a security clearance, for 24 years. She has never married and has no children. She lives with her sister in a house they rent for $1,725 per month. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11, 13, 14, 26; Tr. at 6; GE 3 at 56.) In her Answer, Applicant admitted formerly owing each of the three debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1, totaling $24,088. She denied that she deliberately falsified answers on her e-QIP, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2, explaining that she did not realize any of the debts were 90 or 180 days delinquent since she had been making payments toward them as she was able to do so, and planned to pay them in full when she sold her house. The facts of this case are not in dispute. Applicant had a good credit record and no areas of security concern when she last updated her security clearance in 2001. Her financial troubles arose when she purchased a house for the first time in July 2005, near the peak of the housing boom and predatory mortgage lending era. Shortly after buying the home, she hired Sears to remodel her kitchen, incurring the two loans listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. Her mortgage loan was an \u201c80/20\" loan, meaning that she was given an 80% first mortgage ($185,600) without mortgage insurance, and borrowed the 20% down payment ($46,400) as a second mortgage.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant first encountered financial problems, after a long and successful career\nwith a defense contractor, when she bought a house on risky terms at the peak of the\nhousing boom. Her two home-improvement loans and a credit card became delinquent\nbefore she could sell the house. When the house sold, she applied the proceeds and\nobtained a signature loan to repay the remaining debts. She resumed a financially\nsound lifestyle renting a home. Based upon a thorough review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on April 27, 2007. On December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nJuly 16, 2008\n\n2\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 9, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on January 22, 2008, and on January 31, 2008, she\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on March 24, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case to me on April 1, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 4, 2008. Although Applicant did not\nsign and return her written receipt for the notice of hearing until April 15, 2008, she\nacknowledged on the record that she actually received the notice of hearing at least 15\ndays prior to the hearing. (Tr. at 9.) I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 21,\n2008. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were admitted without objection. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until May 5, 2008, in order for her to submit\nadditional documents. Department Counsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s submission of those\ndocuments, without objection to their consideration, on May 5, 2008. These documents\nwere marked AE I, and the record was closed. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on May 1, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has\nworked, with a security clearance, for 24 years. She has never married and has no\nchildren. She lives with her sister in a house they rent for $1,725 per month. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7\n2, 11, 13, 14, 26; Tr. at 6; GE 3 at 56.) \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted formerly owing each of the three debts alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1, totaling $24,088. She denied that she deliberately falsified answers on her\ne-QIP, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2, explaining that she did not realize any of the debts were\n90 or 180 days delinquent since she had been making payments toward them as she\nwas able to do so, and planned to pay them in full when she sold her house. \nThe facts of this case are not in dispute. Applicant had a good credit record and\nno areas of security concern when she last updated her security clearance in 2001. Her\nfinancial troubles arose when she purchased a house for the first time in July 2005, near\nthe peak of the housing boom and predatory mortgage lending era. Shortly after buying\nthe home, she hired Sears to remodel her kitchen, incurring the two loans listed in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.  Her mortgage loan was an \u201c80/20\" loan, meaning that she was given an\n80% first mortgage ($185,600) without mortgage insurance, and borrowed the 20%\ndown payment ($46,400) as a second mortgage. When equity in the home stopped\nrising at the anticipated rate in 2006, the lender invoked some clause in the contract to\nrequire substantially higher monthly payments to cover mortgage insurance. Applicant\nand her sister could not afford to regularly pay these increased mortgage payments\n\n3\nwhile staying current on her Sears loans and her unsecured $3,423 credit card debt to\nAmerican Express as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She made payments as she could, and\ndecided to sell the house. \nApplicant was in contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate periodic\npayments pending the sale of her home when she planned to pay the debts in full. She\nalways intended to repay her creditors, and rejected the option of voiding the debts\nthrough bankruptcy. When she completed her e-QIP she believed that the imminent\nresolution of these debts meant she did not need to list or disclose them as\ndelinquencies responsive to questions 28.a or 28.b. The credit bureau reports do not\nestablish that any of those debts were indeed 90 or 180 days delinquent at the time she\nsigned her e-QIP. (GE 2; GE 4; AE A; AE B; AE C; AE F; Tr. at 26, 32, 40, 55-57, 64.) \nIn October 2007, Applicant succeeded in selling her home and made about\n$6,000 after paying off her mortgage balances and associated costs. She then qualified\nfor and was given a $22,000 signature loan from her credit union. In November 2007,\nshe used these funds to fully repay the three delinquent debts listed in the SOR. She\nhas made, and can afford to continue making, her regular $600 monthly loan payments\nfor this loan. Her reduced housing costs, now that she and her sister are renting again,\nare low enough that she has regular surplus monthly income. (Tr. at 35-38, 51-55.)\nIn AE I, Applicant provided a letter from a long-time colleague attesting to her\nreliability, dependability, trustworthiness, and good work performance. She also\nincluded two recent performance appraisals and some informal notes describing these\nsame characteristics. Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing reflected her earnest\napproach to her obligations and determination to avoid any debt problems in the future.\nShe testified credibly and demonstrated full awareness of how her problems arose and\nhow to avoid similar issues going forward. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\n\n5\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 82.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe evidence shows that Applicant, as recently as October 2007, was delinquent\nin paying the three SOR-listed debts totaling about $24,000. These delinquencies arose\nbecause her mortgage lender sharply increased her monthly mortgage payments when\nhousing prices stopped rapidly rising. Although she was temporarily unable to repay\nthese debts, she remained in contact with the lenders and made prompt efforts to sell\nthe house to permit repayment of her mortgage and other debt. The record establishes\na long history of financial responsibility with a temporary, 18 to 24 month period when\nshe was unable to repay some of her debts on time. She was never unwilling to repay\nthe debts. Of the three delinquent debts, two of them, comprising 86% of the total\namount, were home improvement loans taken out in connection with purchasing\nApplicant\u2019s former home. At the time these debts were incurred, they were widely\nconsidered to be wise investments in what was, until then, a rapidly rising housing\nmarket. When the boom ended, Applicant found herself unable to meet the cash flow\nrequirements because her lender increased her monthly payments. This relatively brief\nperiod of inability to pay some debts, and short history of not meeting some financial\nobligations raise only minor security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The four\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant did not dispute the debts in question (\u00b6 20(e)), nor is there any concern about\nunexplained affluence (\u00b6 20(f)). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose solely because she, like many others at the\ntime, thought it would be a good investment to buy a home. She entered into a highly\nrisky mortgage arrangement, which went bad when housing prices peaked. This was\n\n6\nnot an unreasonable judgment at the time and, having been burned once, she is most\nunlikely to take such risk again (\u00b6 20(a)). The housing downturn was entirely beyond\nApplicant\u2019s control, was not foreseen by investors far more sophisticated in such\nmatters that she is, and her decision to sell the house and liquidate her debts was highly\nresponsible under the circumstances (\u00b6 20 (b)). Although Applicant did not need or seek\nfinancial counseling, there are crystal-clear indications that she resolved the problem by\nrepaying all the debt and her current financial situation is under control (\u00b6 20(c)). Finally,\nshe did make a good-faith effort and repaid all overdue creditors. Her present loan\nrepayments on her new signature loan are current and fit easily within her monthly\nbudget (\u00b6 20(d)). Taken together, Applicant\u2019s actions, all of which were undertaken\nbefore issuance of the SOR, fully mitigate the minimal security concerns raised by her\ntemporary period of financial over-extension that ended when she sold her house.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the evidence\nin this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s level of financial and legal sophistication, and the absence of\nany security issues arising in her many prior clearance proceedings, she testified\ncredibly that she did not understand that she was incorrectly answering the two finance-\nrelated questions listed in SOR \u00b6 2. She now understands that she should have\nchecked the details more thoroughly and reported any responsive delinquencies. Based\non the evidence, including her demeanor and testimony, I conclude that she did not\ndeliberately omit responsive information in an attempt to conceal it and deceive the\nGovernment about its existence. Accordingly, I find no substantial evidence that she\ndeliberately falsified or omitted information on her e-QIP security clearance application\nwith respect to the delinquencies noted in the SOR, even if they were, in fact, debts that\nqualified for disclosure under the respective questions.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern was a temporary period of financial over-extension brought about due to the\nunforeseen housing downturn. Applicant is a mature, experienced adult who is\naccountable for her decisions and conduct, and has performed her duties at work very\nwell for a long time.  She properly responded to her financial set-back by selling her\nhome and cutting her losses. She has repaid all delinquent debts and is again living in a\nfinancially responsible manner. There is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation\nor duress since she acted responsibly under the circumstances, and is no longer\nfinancially overextended. \nApplicant\u2019s good reputation and performance at work is commendable, and\nfurther mitigates any security concerns arising from her temporary financial hardship.\nShe has no delinquent debt, and has no intention of incurring additional debt in the\nforeseeable future. She acted responsibly to keep her mortgage payments current at\nthe temporary expense of her other debts, thereby protecting her most important asset\nand permitting her to favorably resolve the situation. She remained in communication\nwith her creditors, and her actions under the circumstances demonstrated honesty,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment.\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns\narising from her temporary inability to satisfy debts, and relatively brief history of not\nmeeting financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence leaves no doubt as to\nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated personal conduct and financial\nconsiderations security concerns. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\n          FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                 For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:                                 For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 9, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on\napproximately April 4, 2007 (Government Exhibit 1).  On April 21, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines F and J concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 29, 2008. Pursuant to\nparagraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, the Government requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 15, 2008.\nI received the case assignment on July 10, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJuly 10, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 12, 2008. The\n\n2\nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on August 19, 2008.  The record closed on August 19, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 29 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations in\nthis paragraph of the SOR. The Applicant submits that the majority of his financial\nproblems began when he was fired by a prior employer in 2003 for repeatedly showing\nup late for work.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 22; Government Exhibit 3 at 1;\nTranscript at 29-30, 44-45.)  Since February 2005 the Applicant has been employed by\nhis current employer.  The Applicant states that his intention is to pay all of his past due\nindebtedness while staying current with his other debts.  He wants to pay his largest\ndebts first, then pay the smaller ones. \n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to NCO Fin/99 in the amount of\n$100.00, for an account placed for collection by Sprint PCS.  The Applicant has made\nno payments on this debt and has no current intention to make payments on this debt.\n(Government Exhibit 7 at 1; Transcript at 26.)\n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Arrow Ser in the amount of\n$1,198.00, for an account placed for collection by AFS Assig.  The Applicant has made\nno payments on this debt and has no current intention to make payments on this debt.\n(Government Exhibit 8 at 2; Transcript at 26.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to HSBC Bank in the amount of\n$306.00.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt and has no current\nintention to make payments on this debt.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 6, Transcript at 26.)\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Lvnv Fundg in the amount of\n$1,572.00.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt and has no current\nintention to make payments on this debt.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 4; Transcript at 26.)\n1.i.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Discover in the amount of\n$6,783.00.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt and has no current\nintention to make payments on this debt.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 2; Transcript at 26.)\n\n3\n1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j. and 1.k.  The Applicant admits that he owed USA Funds\n$21,886.00 for six student loans.  These loans were all consolidated and transferred to\nSallie Mae in approximately May or June of 2008.  According to the Applicant, the\namount owed has been reduced to approximately $14,000.00.  He has made one\npayment of $131.00 to Sallie Mae since the consolidation took place.  Before that he\nhad not made any payments for several years.  (Government Exhibit 7 at 4;\nGovernment Exhibit 8 at 4; Transcript at 26-30, 40-43.)\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct.  The Applicant admits all of the\nallegations under this paragraph of the SOR.\n2.a.\nThe Applicant was cited in August 2006 for taking a lobster out of season.\nHe knew at the time he did it that it was not lobster season and that taking the lobster\nwas illegal.  He was fined $420.00 for this offense.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 3;\nTranscript at 32-33, 35.)\n2.b.\nThe Applicant was arrested in December 2005 after assaulting his\nyounger sister and charged with Assault With a Deadly Weapon.  The Applicant, in\ndescribing this event, states, \u201cI laid my hand on her.\u201d  (Transcript at 30.)  He admitted\nthat he had pushed his teenage sister down on the ground and backhanded her across\nthe face in a dispute over a car stereo speaker.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 2-3;\nTranscript at 30-32, 36-38.)  \nHe plead guilty and admitted that he, \u201cUnlawfully committed an assault upon the\nperson of another by means likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d  (Government Exhibit\n4 at 19.)  His sentence included formal probation for a period of three years, a jail term,\nwhich was stayed pending successful completion of probation, community service and a\nfine.  His probation is due to expire in March 2009.  (Government Exhibit 4 at 15.)\n2.c.\nThe Applicant was arrested in 2001 for being involved in a drag race.  He\nwas granted three years summary probation and fined $502.00.  (Government Exhibit 3\nat 1-2; Transcript at 35-36.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has over $23,959.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2001 and 2003.  However, it took him\nuntil 2008 to begin to pay off any of the past due indebtedness.  In addition, he has only\nmade one payment of $131.00 towards his student loans as of the date of the hearing.\nThis mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant was fired from his job because he\nwas consistently tardy.  I cannot find, under these particular circumstances, that the\nApplicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is $23,000.00 in\ndebt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\n\n6\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in a major criminal incident in 2005, which resulted in\nthe victim (his own younger sister) being seriously injured.  The Applicant has attempted\nto minimize the incident by saying he \u201cput my hands on her.\u201d  But, as reflected by his\nguilty plea to a felony concerning his committing Substantial Bodily Harm, the act was\nmore than that.  The other two offenses of drag racing and taking a lobster out of\nseason may seem to be minor in nature, but do reflect a pattern.  AG \u00b6 31(a) applies to\nthis case, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31(d) states that it can be disqualifying if the \u201cindividual is currently on\nparole or probation.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s probation is not due to expire until March 2009.\nThis disqualifying condition also applies to this case.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude that none of them\napply.  As of the time of the hearing, it had not yet been three years since the incident\nand he remains on probation.  I find little, if any, remorse or understanding of what he\ndid to his sister and why it is wrong.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, at\nthis point in time, using the clearly consistent standard, I must find this allegation\nagainst the Applicant.   \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), all of the\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s conduct, financial and criminal, is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I\ncannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8)), or that the likelihood of\nrecurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and his criminal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on July 28, 2006.\nOn November 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F,\nFinancial Considerations. DOHA\u2019s action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn December 18, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested\nthat his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The government\ncompiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 25, 2008.  The FORM\nMarch 13, 2008\n\n2\ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated January 29, 2008,\na copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any\nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt. On December 19,\n2007, Applicant timely filed a response and three exhibits, which I have identified as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ex.) A, Ex. B, and Ex. C.  Department Counsel did not object to\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits or to his response to the FORM, and I have admitted them to the\nrecord of this case. On March 10, 2008, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains 20 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial\nConsiderations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6I 1.a. through 1.t.) (Item 1.)  In his Answer to the SOR, dated\nDecember 18, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.,\n1.f. through 1.j., and 1.l. through 1.t.  He denied allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.k., with\nexplanations.  He also questioned whether \u00b6 1.r. duplicated \u00b6 1.s. and whether \u00b6 1.f.\nwas a duplicate of \u00b6 1.t.  In his response to the FORM, Applicant asserted that\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.t. of the SOR were not duplicates but debts owed to separate\nentities. He provided no credible evidence to corroborate his assertion that SOR\nallegation 1.r. was a duplicate of SOR allegation 1.s.  (Response to FORM at 1.) \nApplicant, who was first granted a security clearance in 1982, is employed as a\nsystems analyst by a government contractor. From approximately 1980 to 1994, he\nserved in the U.S. military. (Item 4.) \nApplicant is 48 years old and has never married.  He shares his household with a\nwoman and her adult son. From approximately September 2003 to June 2006,\nApplicant attended a university.  (Item 4.)\nIn October 1996, Applicant filed a petition for protection from his creditors,\npursuant to Chapter 7, U.S. Bankruptcy Code. He listed $6,625 in assets and $28,654\nin liabilities.  In January 1997, his debts were discharged. (Item 8.)\nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on November 4,\n2004.  The terms of the bankruptcy obligated Applicant to pay his trustee $615 per\nmonth for 57 months in order to satisfy his creditors. Applicant failed to make his\nobligatory payments, and his petition was dismissed in December 2005.  (Item 6.)\nIn February 2006, Applicant\u2019s automobile was repossessed.  At the time of the\nrepossession, Applicant owed the creditor $18,900. While the debt was apparently\nreduced by the proceeds of the repossession sale, the actual amount Applicant still\nowed was unclear. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report of October 25, 2007, indicated a\npast-due debt of $9,958. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated the balance due\nwas $9,958. However, in a communication dated April 4, 2007, acknowledging a post-\ndated check for $300 submitted by Applicant, the successor creditor responsible for\n\nApplicant provided no proof that the post-dated check cleared his bank and was credited to his account.  \n1\n3\ncollecting the debt identified the amount owed by Applicant as $13,751.82.   Applicant\n1\nprovided a statement from the creditor showing the repossession loss fee and the\nrecovery of principal received as of July 19, 2007, which totaled $10,237. This\nstatement included seven $300 payments made by Applicant between January and July\nof 2007. In supplying these figures, the creditor noted they did not constitute full payoff.\n(SOR, \u00b6\u00b6 1.h., 1.i.; Item 3 at 3, 11; Item 4 at 32-33 of 41; Item 5 at 2; Ex. B.)  \nIn addition to the debt owed for the repossessed automobile, Applicant admitted\nresponsibility for nine debts in collection status. These debts totaled approximately\n$12,750.  Two of the debts had not been paid as of September 6, 2006.  Seven of the\ndebts were unpaid as of October 25, 2007.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d, 1.f., 1.g., 1.j., 1.l., 1.m.,\n1.s., 1.t.) Applicant denied responsibility for debts of $128 and $194, which were listed\nat \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.k. of the SOR.  He stated he was not living in the state where the debt\nalleged at \u00b6 1.e. accrued.  He stated he did not have an account with the creditor at the\ntime the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.k. accrued.  (Item 3.)  He provided no credible information,\nhowever,  in support of his denials. \nApplicant also admitted responsibility for one charged-off account, not paid as of\nOctober 25, 2007, and four past-due debts, unpaid as of September 6, 2006. These five\ndebts totaled approximately $3,918.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., and 1.r.; Item 3.)\nIn his response to the  FORM, Applicant provided documentation to show he had\nqualified his delinquent student loan accounts identified on the SOR at \u00b6\u00b6 1.l. and 1.m.\nfor rehabilitation by paying $285 per month for nine consecutive months.  He provided\nadditional information that his loans had subsequently qualified for servicing by the\nStudent Loan Marketing Association.  His new payment schedule required 110 monthly\npayments of $83.57 on an unpaid principal balance of $6,635.67. (Ex. A; Item 3 at 4, 6,\n7-8.)\nApplicant provided evidence he had sent a post-dated check for $100 to the\ncreditor holding the student loan account identified at SOR \u00b6 1.j. However, he provided\nno proof that the post-dated check had cleared his bank and had been credited to his\naccount.  (Item 3 at 10.)\nApplicant provided no evidence that he had received financial credit counseling.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to\nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, the guidelines take\ncognizance of the complexities of human behavior and are applied in conjunction with\nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. The adjudicative process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.  See A G \u00b6\n2(c).\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. A G \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Adjudicative Guideline F, & 18:      \n\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\n& 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated multiple debts and was unable to pay his\nfinancial obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several conditions could mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial delinquency\nmight be resolved if it happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(a))  Additionally,\nunresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. (Guideline F,\n\u00b6 20(b))  Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include evidence\nthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (Guideline F, \u00b6\n20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d).) \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies are numerous, long-standing,\nand continue to the present day. Applicant admitted 15 unpaid delinquencies and failed\nto provided credible evidence to corroborate his denials of two additional debts. The\nmajority of his financial delinquencies remain unresolved and suggest that the\ncircumstances that caused these delinquencies are likely to continue in the future,\nthereby casting doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment.  Accordingly, \u00b6 20(a) does not apply as a mitigating condition.  Applicant\nprovided no credible evidence to support a conclusion that his financial delinquencies\nwere largely beyond his control or that he acted reasonably under the circumstances.\nAccordingly, I conclude \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nNothing in the record suggests Applicant has sought or participated in financial\ncounseling or has in place a plan to avoid financial delinquencies in the future.\nAccordingly, I conclude that \u00b6 20(c) is inapplicable.  \n\n6\nWhile most of Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies remain unaddressed, he\ndeserves credit for rehabilitating two of his delinquent student loans and negotiating a\npayment plan with the creditor. Applicant\u2019s positive actions on his two student loans\nreflect a good faith effort to mitigate long-standing financial delinquencies and resolve\ndebt.  I conclude that \u00b6 20(d) is applicable in part to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nWhole Person Concept\nThe revised adjudicative guidelines and the Directive require that the adjudicative\nprocess in a security clearance case not only assess conduct under the adjudicative\nguidelines, but it must also reflect a careful weighing of a number of variables known as\nthe whole person concept.  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis\ninclude the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or\nrecurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has a history of financial over-extension. His\nhistory of not meeting his financial obligations and his inability to pay his debts over a\nperiod of at least ten years raises a security concern because it suggests a lack of effort\nor resolve. While he has made payments on the debt which arose from the\nrepossession of his automobile, he has not done so consistently. He has not sought\nconsumer credit counseling or assistance in learning how to manage his finances.\nDespite a laudable attempt to establish a payment plan for two of his delinquent student\nloans, Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the majority of his delinquencies will not\ncontinue to be security concerns in the future. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount\nconcern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose\nfurther punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security\nclearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts\nand omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I\nconclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my\ndecision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors\nand guidelines in Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended.  I conclude\nthat Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l.  and 1.m.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.n. through 1.t.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOAN CATON ANTHONY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 30, 2008, admitting the allegations and\nrequesting a hearing. I received the case assignment on July 10, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 25, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n20, 2008. During the hearing, I received three government exhibits and the testimony of\ntwo Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the transcript on September 2, 2008. Based\nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n2\nupon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nRulings of Evidence\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the facts set\nforth in 19 source documents marked and identified as government\u2019s exhibits I through\nXIX. I did not take administrative notice of Exhibits XVI through XIX. Because Applicant\ndid not receive copies of any of the source documents before the hearing, I reserved\njudgment on the remainder, leaving the record open until August 27, 2008 to afford\nApplicant the opportunity to review them. He did not respond, therefore, I will take\nadministrative notice of Exhibits I through XV.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old married man with an infant child. He is a U.S. citizen\nwho was born in Israel, and has lived there nearly his entire life (Tr. 69). His parents are\nChristian missionaries who moved there in the 1960s (Tr. 58-59). They retained their\nU.S. citizenship. For the past 15 years, his father has been the senior pastor at an\ninterdenominational church in West Jerusalem. He talks to his parents approximately\nonce per month (Exhibit 2 at 3).\nDuring Applicant\u2019s childhood, he lived in several communities in Jerusalem with\npeople from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. The neighborhoods ranged from majority\nIsraeli to majority Arab. Sometimes he lived in neighborhoods with a combination of\nboth ethnic groups (Tr. 105). Applicant spent the majority of his childhood living in West\nJerusalem, a majority Jewish area (Tr. 105). All of his neighbors at that time were Israeli\nJews (Tr. 106). From fourth to sixth grade, he went to an Israeli school and was the only\nnon-Israeli who attended (Tr. 106). From grades seven through twelve, he attended a\nChristian school. His classmates were \u201ckids from all over\u201d including diplomats\u2019 children,\nPalestinians, and some Israeli Jews (Tr. 106).\nThroughout Applicant\u2019s childhood, his family visited the U.S. for extended visits\napproximately every other year (Tr. 68). Through 2005, none of his trips to the U.S. had\nexceeded three months (Tr. 69).\nAfter graduating from high school in 1995, Applicant attended an elite, American\nschool located in Jordan to study the Arabic language (Tr. 65). He earned a certificate in\n1997 (Exhibit 1 at 7). He then returned to Jerusalem to attend college at a Jewish\nuniversity (Tr. 63; Answer, SOR \u00b61.h). He majored in middle eastern studies, Islamic\nstudies, and Biblical studies (Tr. 100-101). While attending college, he worked for a\nUnited Kingdom-based newspaper as a correspondent and a translator (Tr. 64). By\nthen, he was fluent in English, Hebrew, and Arabic (Tr. 65).\nWhile in college, Applicant met his wife, who was also studying there at the time\n(Tr. 67). They married in 2001.\n\nBetween May 2005 and November 2006, Applicant was unemployed. He supported himself through a\n1\ncombination of savings and the help of his wife, who obtained a job (Tr. 70).\n3\nApplicant graduated from college in June 2004 (Exhibit 1 at 6). He continued to\nwork for a foreign-owned newspaper in Jerusalem from 1998 until 2005 (Answer, SOR \u00b6\n1.i). During this time, he \u201cwould periodically read about how after 9/11, there was a dire\nneed for people with skills in the Arabic language, and specifically with regional\nexperience\u201d (Tr. 102). In May 2005, he decided to leave his job at the newspaper, move\nto the U.S., and seek work as a translator and/or an analyst.\nApplicant began working for his current employer in November 2006 as an Arabic\nmedia analyst (Exhibit 1 at 8; Tr. 85).  He provides analysis to the U.S. military of how\n1\nits daily activities are being covered in the Arab media (Tr. 85). Also, before a U.S.\ngeneral is interviewed by an Arab media outlet, he prepares an analysis brief of the\nmedia outlet and reviews it with the general (Tr. 110). His goal is to help the officers\ngain \u201csome idea of what they [are] getting into when being interviewed by [the\nrespective Arabic media outlet],\u201d and to minimize the possibility of any cultural faux pas\n(Tr. 110). Recently, he translated the U.S. Central Command\u2019s website into Arabic (Tr.\n109). \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Jordanian citizen. She has recently applied for U.S.\ncitizenship (Tr. 53). She was born in East Jerusalem, and spent most of her childhood in\nthe United Arab Emirates (Tr. 78; 107). From Israel\u2019s founding in 1948 through 1967,\nEast Jerusalem was part of Jordan (Exhibit VII at 10) After the Six-Day War, Israel\nannexed it, but did not extend Israeli citizenship to its residents (Tr. 51). Currently, it\nremains under Israeli jurisdiction (Id.; Exhibit VII at 10). The majority of its residents are\nethnic Palestinians with Jordanian citizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship (Tr. 97). He\nworks for a private, multinational bank (Tr. 98). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is originally\nfrom South Korea. She is a Jordanian citizen by virtue of her marriage to Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law (Tr. 99). She is a retired nurse (Id.). Applicant\u2019s wife and in-laws are all\nChristians (Tr. 68). Applicant talks to his in-laws once every few months (Tr. 98).\nRecently, they visited him and his wife in the U.S. after their baby was born, staying for\nfive weeks (Tr. 98).\nApplicant has four sisters and two brothers. All are U.S. citizens. His oldest sister\nis a homemaker who lives in Israel (Tr. 81; 89). She is married to an American. He talks\nwith her a few times per month. She and her family spend each summer in the U.S.\nWhile here, they live in a summer home that they own, and usually visit Applicant\u2019s\nfamily before returning to Israel.\n\nThere is no record of her husband\u2019s nationality.\n2\n4\nAnother sister is a high school teacher by training who is currently a homemaker.\nShe lives in Jerusalem with her husband, a professor.  They are in the process of\n2\nmoving to Italy (Tr. 81). Applicant talks with her approximately twice a month (Tr. 81).\nApplicant\u2019s third sister lives in Jerusalem (Tr. 93). She is a home health care\naide, and is earning a master\u2019s degree in psychology (Tr. 81). He talks with her\napproximately once per month. Her husband is a U.S. citizen who works with a\nChristian ministry which promotes reconciliation between Jews and Arabs (Tr. 93).\nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister is a college student who lives with him (Tr. 82). She is not\nmarried.\nApplicant\u2019s younger brother is a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force (Tr. 81). He\nfinished the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in 2005. He is currently stationed in\nthe U.S., and is preparing to deploy to a combat theatre (Tr. 82). \nApplicant\u2019s youngest brother is a recent college graduate who lives with their\nparents in Jerusalem (Answer, SOR \u00b61.d). He is a filmmaker (Tr. 81-82). He is not\nmarried. Generally, Applicant talks with him when he talks with his parents.\nSince moving to the U.S., Applicant has traveled to Jerusalem three times to visit\nhis family (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He has visited Jordan several times over the years. The visits\nhave included weekend leisure trips with family members, and trips to visit friends\n(Exhibit 2 at 4; Tr. 107).\nApplicant has approximately $30,000 of assets including stocks, and personal\nsavings. All of it is invested in the U.S. (Tr. 126).\nApplicant did not register for the draft as required by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 453 (Answer, \u00b6\n2.a). He knew that he had an obligation to register, and had planned upon doing so\nwhen he moved to the U.S. After moving to the U.S. and applying, he discovered that\nhe was past the age limit (Tr. 111; 116-117). In 2005, he wrote the Selective Service\ninforming it of his failure to register (Tr. 113). \nIsraeli citizenship is available to Jews living anywhere in the world. Non-Jews are\nprohibited from becoming Israeli citizens. Israel and the U.S. are bound closely by\nhistoric and cultural ties as well as mutual strategic interests (Exhibit VII at 10). There\nhave been, however, some cases of individuals prosecuted and convicted of spying\nagainst the U.S. for Israel (Exhibit VII at 30). The threat of terrorist attacks in Israel is\nongoing, and the U.S. government warns that American interests could be the focus of\nsuch attacks (Exhibit VIII at 4).\nJordan has enjoyed a close relationship with the U.S. for six decades (Exhibit I at\n5, 6). It is ruled by a king, has a council of ministers selected by the king, and has a\npartially elected national assembly (Id. at 1, 2). The king has repeatedly denounced\n\n5\nextremists, and promotes a tolerant, moderate brand of Islam (Exhibit IV at 8). Recently\nJordan\u2019s parliament passed new anti-money laundering legislation aimed at individuals\nand entities which attempt to bankroll terrorist groups. Also, it has organized a state\nsecurity court that specializes in cases involving terrorism.\nDespite Jordan\u2019s vigilant efforts to combat terrorism, the threat remains (Exhibit II\nat 2). Terrorist groups in Jordan use covert, overt, and clandestine activities to\nundermine and exploit U.S. national security interests (Exhibit II at 2).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\n\nUnder this guideline, a security concern may exist if relatives are residing in a foreign country even if they are\n3\nU.S. citizens. The corresponding disqualifying and mitigating conditions reference \u201cforeign persons\u201d but do\nnot consistently reference U.S. citizens resident in foreign countries. W hen using the word \u201cforeign\u201d in my\nanalysis, I have construed it to mean both \u201csituated outside a place or country and [especially] one\u2019s own\ncountry,\u201d and \u201cborn in, belonging to, or characteristic of some place or country other than the one under\nconsideration\u201d  Mirriam-W ebster Dictionary, 11  Edition, Mirriam-W ebster, Inc., 2005.\nth\n6\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6).  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s parents, some of his siblings, and both of his parent-in-laws live in\nJerusalem, a city under Israeli control with a sizeable population of Palestinians who are\nJordanian citizens. It remains a focal point of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Although\nJordan is an ally of the U.S., and has recognized Israel under a peace agreement\napproximately 15 years ago, terrorist elements within its borders actively seek to\nundermine both the efforts at a long-term, peaceful resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli\nconflict, and other U.S. strategic and regional interests. The presence of Applicant\u2019s\nfamily members in an area where so many countries, ethnicities, and transnational\ngroups have competing and sometimes hostile interests generates the application of AG\n\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Jordanian citizen. Because she lives with him in the U.S.,\ntheir relationship does not create a direct security risk. Nevertheless, Applicant is\npotentially subject to coercion through his wife from her parents who are Jordanian\ncitizens living in East Jerusalem. AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members are U.S. citizens who are part of a small\ncommunity of Americans that live in Israel. Although Israel is a staunch ally of the U.S.,\nit has a history of conducting espionage against the U.S. As non-Jews, Applicant\u2019s\nfamily members cannot be Israeli citizens under Israeli law. Consequently, no sense of\nethnic chauvinism or national pride exists which would induce them to coerce Applicant\ninto providing classified information. Although their unique status makes them\nvulnerable targets for exploitation by the Israeli government, it is unlikely that it would\nattempt to use overt intimidation to exploit Applicant\u2019s relationship with them considering\nits role as the only transparent democracy in the region. \nJordan is not a democracy; however, its historically strong relationship with the\nU.S., and its demonstrated track record of assistance in helping the U.S. achieve its\nstrategic objectives in the region render it similarly unlikely that it would use overt\nintimidation to exploit Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws. Conversely, despite the\nbest efforts of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, terrorists operate extensively\nthroughout the region, and retain the capacity to strike both on Jordanian soil and Israeli\n\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\n4\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15).\n7\nsoil. Such groups would not hesitate to use the threat of overt force to exploit\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his family members in Jerusalem. Moreover, terrorists\u2019\ngoverning philosophies and objectives are completely antithetical to U.S. interests. The\npervasive presence of terrorists in this region renders the potentially mitigating condition\nlisted in AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment, and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d inapplicable.\nApplicant has a close relationship with his relatives, visiting them and speaking\nwith them whenever he gets an opportunity. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d apply.\nApplicant has only lived in the U.S. for three years. Although a friend testified\ncredibly and persuasively on his behalf at the hearing, he has yet to develop\nlongstanding relationships in the U.S. necessary to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 8(b),\n\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \nThe inapplicability of AG \u00b6 8(b) does not compel a conclusion that Applicant\nwould not resolve a conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He is a loyal,\nintensely patriotic American who was born a U.S. citizen, as were all of his immediate\nfamily members. His brother is an officer in the U.S. Air Force. AG \u00b6 8(b) is inapplicable\nbecause his most significant longstanding relationships with U.S. citizens were\ndeveloped abroad, not in the U.S., as the mitigating condition requires.\nNone of the remaining disqualifying and mitigating conditions are relevant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s failure to register for the draft raises a personal conduct security\nconcern.  He certainly exercised bad judgment when he decided to wait until he moved\n4\nto the U.S. before registering without checking the law beforehand. He did attempt to\nregister when he moved to the U.S., as planned, but discovered that he was by then too\nold. His omission, however, was an honest mistake, rather than an intentional attempt to\nevade the draft. Although his explanation mitigated the personal conduct security\nconcern, his failure to register underscores his disconnection from American society\ngrowing up in a foreign country.\n\nISCR Case No. 03-12882 (App. Bd., July 20, 2005).\n5\nISCR Case No. 99-0462 (App. Bd., May 25, 2000) at 5.\n6\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d The mere presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot dispositive.  Instead, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\n5\nsecurity clearance is an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines within the context of the whole person concept.\nThe War on Terror is both a military and an ideological war. The adversary\noperates across multiple countries, and uses religion and culture as a pretense for its\ndestructive activities. Consequently, the U.S. military has had to strike a balance\nbetween aggressively fighting terrorists without creating the perception that it is waging\nwar against the culture and religion of the respective countries where terrorists operate.\nThe promotion of American values - respect for the rule of law, religious tolerance,\nfreedom of speech, and the respect for human rights - have been critical to this\nendeavor. \nBy serving the military as an Arab media analyst who is helping senior military\nofficers communicate more effectively with the various communities where much of the\nWar on Terror is being fought, Applicant is making a critical contribution to its long-term\nsuccess. None of the foreign influence mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\nwas born in the Middle East where much of his immediate family remains, and raised\namong Jews and Arabs in a city that remains a volatile flashpoint for conflict. However,\nhis years living as a U.S. citizen in the Middle East are precisely what makes him a\nunique and valuable asset to the U.S. military effort in the region.\n I am cognizant of Appeal Board jurisprudence which holds that the issue of an\napplicant\u2019s security clearance-worthiness typically does not turn on whether (s)he\npossesses unique professional abilities.  However, the Appeal Board has held that the\n6\ninvaluable aid of an applicant to the War on Terrorism can overcome foreign influence\n\nISCR Case No. 04-12363 (App. Bd., July 14, 2006) at 2; ISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd., February 5,\n7\n2008).\nSee generraly, U.S. v. DiFransesco, 449 U.S. 117(1980); Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Cenance, 452 U.S. 155;\n8\nBall v. James, 451 U.S. 355 (1981).\n9\nsecurity concerns.  Moreover, to deny Applicant a clearance when his unique\n7\nprofessional abilities constitute the same factors which generate a foreign influence\nsecurity concern would be to exalt form over substance. The Supreme Court has held\nthat \u201cthe exaltation of form over substance is to be avoided.\u201d  Upon considering all of\n8\nthe facts and circumstances together with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, in\nthe context of the whole person concept I conclude Applicant has carried the burden.\nClearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 9, 2006. On \nMay 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines F, J, and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nNovember 13, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nSeptember 17, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on September 22, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October \n20, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 12 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until October 27, 2008, to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX G, which was admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX G are attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit I. The record closed on October 27, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 28, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.z under Guideline F, admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2,e under Guideline J, \nand denied the allegations of falsifying his security clearance application alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b under Guideline E. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old test electrician employed by a defense contractor. He \nhas worked for his current employer since April 2006. He served on active duty in the \nU.S. Navy from March 2000 to October 2002, and he received a security clearance \nwhile in the Navy. \n \n \nWhile in the Navy, Applicant became involved with a woman who wanted to rent \nan off-base apartment. Applicant testified he did not like the apartment and refused to \nrent it. He believes the woman forged his name on a lease, lived in the apartment for a \nwhile, failed to pay the rent, and then left after causing significant damage. The unpaid \njudgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s through 1.v resulted (Tr. 52-54). ). Applicant testified \nand presented evidence that the unpaid judgments were satisfied by garnishments of \nhis pay (AX B through F; Tr. 79-80). \n \n \nWhile still in the Navy, Applicant subsequently met another woman and they \nwere married. While deployed, he learned that his wife was having an affair, and his \ncommanding officer started receiving letters indicating that his wife was not paying the \nhousehold bills (Tr. 69-70). Applicant received nonjudicial punishment at a captain\u2019s \nmast in October 2002, for violating an order by riding in a vehicle while ashore in a \nforeign country. He testified his disobedience of an order was the catalyst for his \ndischarge before completing his enlistment. He testified his commander told him he \nwould not \u201chammer\u201d him because of all the things he had done, but he did not specify \nwhat \u201call the things\u201d were. Shortly after his nonjudicial punishment, he received a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions (Tr. 71). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed after his discharge until March 2003. He worked \ntemporary jobs from March to June 2003, was unemployed from June to September \n2003, and was employed at various entry-level jobs from September 2003 until April \n2006, when he began his current job. \n \n \nSome of the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred during Applicant\u2019s marriage, \ne.g., the delinquent debts for furniture alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l (Tr. 51). After he \nand his wife jointly purchased and financed a car, his wife left him and took the car. He \ntold the dealership to repossess the car because he did not know where it was. The \ndelinquent debt of $9,163 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m resulted from the repossession (Tr. 86-\n88). \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant was involved in a domestic disturbance with his \nwife (GX 7). This incident arose when his wife brought her boyfriend to his house (GX 5 \nat 3). He testified he grabbed her wrist and pushed her onto a sofa when she attacked \nhim with a knife (Tr. 59-61). The record does not reflect that Applicant was arrested or \ncharged. He testified he was told by the police to leave the house and he complied. He \ndid not believe he was arrested or charged (Tr. 60-61). He divorced his wife in October \n2006 (Tr. 76). \n \n \nAt some time after September 2002, Applicant became involved in a relationship \nwith the woman who is now his fianc\u00e9e. They have two children, ages 3 and two \nmonths, and his fianc\u00e9e has two children from a previous relationship, ages 7 and 6 (Tr. \n77). In September 2004, Applicant was charged with assault and battery after a \ndomestic dispute with his fianc\u00e9e. The case was disposed of by nolle prosequi on the \nprosecution\u2019s motion when his fianc\u00e9e failed to appear in court (GX 9; Tr. 103). \n \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant was again charged with assault and battery after a \ndispute with his fianc\u00e9e. This charge arose from a domestic argument when Applicant \ngrabbed his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s arm and shook her to stop her from annoying him. The court \nfound the facts sufficient to find guilt, but deferred adjudication and placed Applicant on \nprobation (GX 10). His probation included a requirement to attend 12 weeks of anger \nmanagement classes. The charges were dismissed in July 2007 (GX 5 at 9). \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on a 16-year-old \nboy. This incident occurred when Applicant\u2019s 16-year-old neighbor, while intoxicated, \ncame to his door at 3:00 a.m. and confronted him about a dispute he had with \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Applicant testified the boy attacked him and a scuffle ensued. He \ndid not know the boy\u2019s age until he was charged (GX 5 at 9-10). In January 2007, the \ncourt found the evidence sufficient to find guilt but continued the case without entering a \nverdict, conditioned on Applicant\u2019s good behavior. In July 2007, the charges were \ndismissed (GX 11).  \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant was charged with failure to appear in court. An \narrest warrant was issued on September 21, 2006. Applicant testified he turned himself \nin when he learned about the warrant (Tr. 112). In January 2007, he pleaded not guilty, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbut he was found guilty of contempt of court and fined $25 (GX 12). He testified his \nfailure to appear was the court clerk\u2019s error because he was summoned to appear in \ntwo courtrooms at the same time (Tr. 62-63). He also testified he paid the fine \u201cjust to \nget it out of the way\u201d even though he did not believe he was at fault (Tr. 114). \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was again arrested for assault and battery on his \nfianc\u00e9e. He testified this incident occurred when his fianc\u00e9e threatened him with a knife \nand he forcefully took it from her (Tr. 115). The charges were disposed of by nolle \nprosequi (Tr. 116). This incident is not alleged in the SOR, and it occurred after he \nsubmitted his security clearance application. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he does not anticipate any more domestic violence even \nthough the offenses in September 2004, May 2006, and January 2007 involved the \nwoman he intends to marry in November 2008. He testified they are older and have \nmore responsibility, especially after the birth of their daughter two months ago, and they \ndon\u2019t talk to each other the way they used to (Tr. 134).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in November 2006, \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23c, asking if there were currently any charges pending \nagainst him for any criminal offense. He did not disclose his two arrests in May 2006 or \nthe charge of failing to appear in court, all of which were pending. He also answered \n\u201cno\u201d to question 23f, asking if he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of \nany offenses not listed elsewhere on his application, and he did not disclose any of his \narrests and charges. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he did not remember \nbeing arrested in September 2002. He also stated his probation officers told him he was \nnot required to disclose his arrests because they would not be reflected on his record, \nand that he attempted to contact DOHA when he realized he had answered some \nquestions incorrectly.  \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2007, he \ndisclosed his arrests in May and July 2006, but not his arrests in September 2004 and \nSeptember 2006. He told the investigator he had not committed any other related \noffenses (GX 5 at 10). In response to DOHA interrogatories on February 19, 2008, \nApplicant verified the accuracy if the investigator\u2019s record of their interview and provided \nadditional information about his arrests in September 2004, May 2006, July 2006, and \nSeptember 2006 (GX 5 at 2-3). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 26 delinquent debts totaling more than $30,000. Applicant \nadmitted all the debts, and his admissions are corroborated by his credit reports. Ten of \nthe debts are medical bills totaling about $7,000. The medical bills were incurred after \nApplicant left the Navy and before he had medical insurance.  \n \nApplicant applied for a debt consolidation loan of $22,000 in June 2006, but his \napplication was rejected (GX 4 at 15). In September 2008, he retained an attorney to \n\u201caudit and verify the status of his credit reports,\u201d because he believed some of the \naccounts were inaccurate, invalid, or unverifiable (AX A). In his post-hearing submission \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted evidence he had paid the judgment for unpaid rent alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.q (AX G). \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, reflecting net monthly income of $1,226.60, \nexpenses of $1,617.62, and a monthly shortfall of $281.02 (GX 4 at 5). His weekly pay \nstubs for the period from September 14 to October 28, 2008 reflect that his net weekly \npay varied between $456.70 and $989.80, depending on the amount of overtime he \nworked and the amounts deducted from his pay because of garnishments (AX B \nthrough F). He frequently works 12-hour days to generate overtime pay. He walks to \nwork because he does not own a car (Tr. 97). He has no active credit cards (Tr. 100). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 26 delinquent debts, including six unpaid judgments totaling \nmore than $30,000. Applicant admitted all the delinquent debts, but he presented \nevidence that the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q through 1.v had been satisfied. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised \nwhen there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when \nthere is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, \nand/or other financial analysis.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history raises these three \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \n\n \n7 \n \n \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d  \n \nThe first two prongs of AG \u00b6 20(a) are not established because Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are numerous and many are not yet resolved. Some of the debts were \nincurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, such as the unpaid judgments for the \napartment rented by Applicant\u2019s girlfriend (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r-1.v), the delinquent car loan \ncaused when Applicant\u2019s wife left him and took their new car but did not make the \npayments (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and the uninsured medical expenses incurred before he had \nmedical insurance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d-1.g, 1.n, 1.w-1.z). The final prong (\u201cdoes not cast \ndoubt\u201d), however, is not established because of the number and dollar amounts of \nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts make him vulnerable to coercion, duress, or exploitation. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s premature \ndischarge from the Navy and subsequent period of unemployment were not due to \nconditions beyond his control, because they were caused by his own behavior. His \nsubsequent periods of unemployment and underemployment, his divorce, the car \nrepossession precipitated by his wife\u2019s misconduct, the fraudulent lease executed by a \nformer girlfriend, and the uninsured medical expenses were beyond his control. He has \nresolved some of his debts, but is constrained by his limited income. He works 12-hour \ndays to generate overtime pay. He appears to live frugally. He has done all that can be \nreasonably expected on his limited income. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d-1.g, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.r-1.z. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \ncondition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received credit \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncounseling and his problem is not being resolved. He has retained a lawyer, but only for \nthe limited purpose of challenging entries on his credit report. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nThe evidence reflects that the unpaid judgment for back rent (SOR \u00b6 1.q) was entered \nagainst Applicant in January 2007 and he paid it in full in February 2007. Although \nApplicant testified that his pay was garnished to pay the unpaid judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.s-1.v, it appears that the unpaid judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.r also was covered by the same \ngarnishment, because it involves the same creditor, a similar amount, and the same \njudgment date. Applicant\u2019s pay stubs reflect that the last deduction from his pay \npursuant to the garnishment was on September 14, 2008, after $3,451 had been \ncollected. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the unpaid judgments alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.v, but not for the other unpaid debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Although \nApplicant has hired a lawyer to \u201caudit and verify\u201d his adverse credit report entries, this \nmitigating condition is not established because he has not identified which credit report \nentries are questionable or the basis for challenging them. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges three arrests for domestic violence, one arrest for assault and \nbattery on a 16-year-old boy, and a charge of failure to appear in court. The evidence \npresented in support of SOR \u00b6 2.a, the alleged arrest in September 2002, fails to \nestablish that an arrest occurred, and the evidence of the underlying conduct fails to \nestablish criminal conduct by Applicant. I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAlthough Applicant testified he was wrongly convicted of contempt of court (SOR \u00b6 2.e), \nhe pleaded not guilty, was convicted, and paid his fine. I conclude there is substantial \nevidence to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.e. \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). The evidence is sufficient to raise AG 31(a) and (c). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest for assault and battery charges in January 2007 was not \nalleged in the SOR.  However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered: A(a) \nto assess an applicant=s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision \nof the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.@ ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006) (citations omitted). I have considered Applicant\u2019s arrest in January 2007 for these \nlimited purposes. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Applicant\u2019s latest \nincident of domestic violence occurred in January 2007. Like all his incidents of \ndomestic violence, it arose from an argument that became physical. Although he \ntestified he and his fianc\u00e9e have matured and changed their way of communicating, it is \ntoo soon to tell whether their physical altercations will recur. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). As noted above, it is too soon to determine whether he has changed his behavior \nwith respect to domestic violence. The evidence is insufficient to establish \u201csuccessful \nrehabilitation.\u201d \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by not \ndisclosing that his charge of failure to appear in court was pending (SOR \u00b6 3.a), and \nfailing to disclose his arrests in 2002, 2004, and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 3.b). It also alleges \nApplicant was discharged from the Navy for a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d (SOR \u00b6 3.c). No \ndocumentary evidence of his discharge or the basis for it was presented by Department \nCounsel. The record does not reflect whether Applicant was performing his duties \npoorly because he was distracted and depressed by his marital problems, or whether he \nmanifested his mental distress by other misconduct in addition to the one incident that \nresulted in a captain\u2019s mast. I conclude the allegation of a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d is not \nsupported by substantial evidence, and I resolve SOR \u00b6 3.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b is \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not disclose the September 2002 arrest because he did \nnot believe he was arrested. He testified did not disclose the arrests in September 2004, \nMay 2006, September 2006 because they had been resolved and he believed, based \non advice from a probation officer, that he was not required to disclose them. He did not \nexplain his failure to disclose that the charge of failing to appear in court was pending.  \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). Applicant has given no plausible \nexplanation for not disclosing his pending charges for failure to appear in court in his \nresponse to question 23c. His explanation for not disclosing the September 2002 arrest \nin his response to 23f is plausible, credible, and supported by the record. His \nexplanation for not disclosing his domestic violence arrests in response to question 23f \nis plausible and credible, but the plain language of question 23f required him to disclose \nhis arrest for failure to appear in response to question 23f if he did not disclose it in \nresponse to question 23a. His failure to disclose the charge of failure to appear in \nresponse to either question 23a or 23f raises AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Security concerns based on false or misleading answers also \nmay be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or \nconcealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process.\u201d This mitigating condition is not \nestablished unless, \u201c[u]pon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or \nprovide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(b).  \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant stated he tried to contact the security \nspecialist who signed the SOR when he realized he had answered question 23f \nincorrectly. His attempts to contact the security specialist are not corroborated by any \n\n \n11 \n \n \nother evidence, but his statement was not refuted by any evidence offered by \nDepartment Counsel at the hearing. He also asserted he received bad advice from a \nprobation officer, but he did not assert any bad advice regarding his failure to disclose \nhis pending charge for failing to appear. When he was interviewed by a security \ninvestigator in April 2007, he disclosed his arrests in May and July 2006, but not his \narrests in September 2004 and September 2006, and he told the investigator he had not \ncommitted any other related offenses. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (b) are not \nestablished, because Applicant did not fully disclose his arrest record in his security \ninterview or in response to DOHA interrogatories. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also can be mitigated if \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s omissions from his security clearance application were not minor, and they \nwere recent. He repeated some of the omissions in his security interview in April 2007. \nHis omissions were not the product of unique circumstances, and they cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \nThe government\u2019s failure to prove that Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Navy was \nbased on a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d does not end the inquiry under Guideline E. The \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 17(c) is raised where there is \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s difficulties in the Navy, his financial situation, his record of \ndomestic violence, and his lack of candor during the security clearance process, when \nconsidered as a whole, raise this disqualifying condition. None of the enumerated \nmitigating conditions, including those discussed above, are established. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n12 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, J, and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a sincere young man who appears to have finally found a rewarding \njob. His personal life has been tumultuous. He is working hard to overcome his past, but \nhe has limited income, and he has not yet demonstrated that his record of domestic \nviolence is behind him. His lack of candor on his security clearance application and \nduring the ensuing security investigation raises questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F, J, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial \nconsiderations, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.v: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.w-1.z: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 2,\n2007. On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 23, 2008, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 16, 2008.  Applicant received a\n1\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 26, 2008, and was provided the\nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Applicant submitted additional information on July 31, 2008. The\ncase was assigned to me on August 12, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated April 23, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.I, 1.m, 1.n, 1.s, 1.u, and 1.v of the SOR. She\ndenied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l 1.o, 1.p, 1.r, 1.t, and 1.x of the SOR with explanations\nbecause she had no knowledge of them. She neither admitted nor denied allegations\n1.q and 1.w. Applicant provided additional information to support her request for\neligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school, and attended college for several years from 1981 until 1983. She has taken\nother courses over the years. She is divorced with one daughter who is 15 years old.\nShe has worked for her current employer since February 2007 (Item 4).\nFrom 1994 until 2001, Applicant worked in a home business (Id). She had\nperiods of unemployment for seven months in 2006. She also reported unemployment\nfrom April 2004 until June 2005 (more than one year). \nApplicant had no financial difficulties until 2003 when her husband divorced her.\nShe did not receive alimony or child support. She used various credit cards to purchase\nfurniture for her apartment and for other essentials. She has student loans in deferment\nstatus. Applicant injured her back in 2006, had surgery and resultant medical bills that\nshe could not pay, even with insurance. She could not work for months as described\nabove. This led to more delinquent bills (Item 5).\nThe SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts, including medical collection accounts\n($17,000) The total amount of other debt that Applicant owes is approximately $55,286\n(Items 6 and 7).\nApplicant admitted that the medical accounts in allegations \u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.\nare not paid because she is dealing with the insurance company. She provided no\ndocumentation for this assertion. \nApplicant admitted some of the debts but claimed they were due to periods of\nunemployment or low paying jobs. There is no evidence of any payments that were\nmade to any accounts.\nApplicant stated that she does not know what the debts are in the following\nallegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.w, and 1.x. She did not\nprovide any documentation to support a dispute regarding the debt. Applicant stated\nshe is awaiting an updated account from one of her credit reports (Item 5).\n\n3\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: all accounts\nlisted in the SOR remain unpaid or in collection. Applicant did not report receiving\nfinancial counseling. She claimed she has thought about counseling and obtaining help\nfrom a company to establish a repayment plan but has not done so. Applicant also\npromised to use tax refunds to take care of some of the debts (Item 5).\nApplicant\u2019s answer and submissions to the FORM explain the delinquent debts\nfrom her credit reports and her inability to pay due to making insufficient income. She\nstated that when she has some extra money, there is usually a car repair or some other\nunexpected medical expense. She states that she tries to pay her current bills. She\nemphasized that she disputed the delinquent bills or claimed that the debt was unknown\nto her. She did not provide sufficient documentation to support her position concerning\nthe disputed debts alleged.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $2,186. She reported monthly\nexpenses of $1,628 a month. Her net remainder is listed as $5.00 (Item 5). She has a\ncar payment of $376. She listed assets of $5,000 (miscellaneous).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n4\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous credit\naccounts and medical collections. She did not meet her financial obligations from 2003\nuntil the present time. Her credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\n\n5\nfinancial worries arose in approximately 2003. She accumulated some delinquent debt\ndue to an inability to pay due to a divorce in 2003 and periods of unemployment. While\nthose circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that\npoint. She has not acted responsibly. Her conduct over the last six months with her\ncreditors does not remove security concerns or doubts about her current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. She has approximately $55,000 in delinquent debt.\nThis potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported periods of unemployment in her answer to the FORM and divorce in\n2003. She had back surgery in 2006. Although Applicant\u2019s divorce may have initially\nstarted a downturn for her, she did not provide any explanation as to how this impacted\nher ability to pay other debts. After she became re-employed, she did not act\nresponsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. Applicant did not\nprovide documentation that the debts alleged have been disputed. Her reliance on lack\nof knowledge about the debts is not resolution of the financial issue. Her efforts are not\nsufficient to carry her burden in this case. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant originally stated that\nshe disputed some debts. She did not elaborate in her response or provide\ndocumentation. Her efforts focus on dispute rather than paying them or providing\ndocumentation that they are not her bills. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition\ndoes not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a single parent and provides for her\ndaughter without benefit of alimony or child support. She had a medical problem and\nsurgery in 2006. Since her divorce in 2003, she has fallen behind on her bills. She had\nto use credit for living expenses. She had low paying jobs and some unemployment.\nHowever, Applicant has a long history of financial difficulties and has not resolved any\ndebts. The record contains scant information concerning Applicant. She chose to have\nher case decided on the written record. Her answer to the SOR and submissions to the\nFORM are not sufficient for her to meet the burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the financial\nconsiderations guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",
