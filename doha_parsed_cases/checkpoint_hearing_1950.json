Eligibility to hold a public trust position is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 7, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why \nunder the financial considerations guideline it could not make the preliminary affirmative \ndetermination of eligibility for holding a public trust position, and recommended referral \nto an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility to hold a public position \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1\n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR on June 30, 2020 with the aid of an \nextension granted to her prior counsel, and requested a hearing. A hearing was \nscheduled for November 17, 2020. The case was heard on the scheduled date. At the \nhearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits (GE 1 through 3). Applicant \nrelied on 17 exhibits and one witness (herself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 14, 2020. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 15 delinquent debts that exceed \n$63,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged debts covered by \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p with explanations. She claimed that each of the debts listed in \nthe SOR have either been paid or are covered by payment plans. She claimed full \nresponsibility for her debts and explained that her financial difficulties were due to \ncircumstances beyond her control after losing her job in March 2017 and \nthen \ncommitting to becoming a full-time caregiver for her recovering mother and cancer-\nstricken grandmother. \nApplicant claimed that her grandmother has since passed away and her mother \nis improved and can now walk without a walker. She further claimed that now that now \nthat she has returned to work with a good-paying job she can afford to start making \npayments on her debts, which she has done. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old executive assistant for a defense contractor who seeks \neligibility to hold a public trust position.

She has since addressed all of the \ndebts (save for a medical debt for $282 covered by SOR \u00b6 1.k). Reportedly, SOR \ncreditor 1.k is no longer in business and could not be reached to resolve the debt. \nSince returning to full-time employment in 2019, she has paid off five of the listed \ndebts in full: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($808), 1.j ($565), 1.l ($ 241), 1.o ($454), and 1.p ($420). (AEs   \nF-L; Tr. 51-56) Addressing the remaining debts, she has entered into payment plans \nwith all but one (SOR \u00b6 1.k) of the named creditors in the SOR.

(AE O; Tr. 56, 60) She \nis current with her remaining debts. (GEs 2-3) \nCharacter references, awards, and performance evaluations \nApplicant is well-regarded by her manager and colleagues who know her well, \nhave worked with her, and are aware of the financial circumstances that impacted her \nability to address her debts. (AE C) Uniformly, they credit her with good character traits: \nhonesty, caring for her colleagues and customers, and exceptional enthusiasm for her \nwork. (AE C) They characterize her as a colleague with excellent leadership and \ncommunication skills and with a heart full of passion for helping others. (AE C) Her \nprogram and task manager with daily interaction with her credited her with being honest, \ntrustworthy, and diligent in providing quality services for her government clients and \nreliable handling of sensitive information. (AE C) \nApplicant has received solid performance evaluations from her employer. (AE A) \nHer 2029-2020 performance ratings credit her with meeting expectations in most of the \nrated categories. Only in the areas of adaptability and results were improvement needs \nnoted. (AE A) In these two later rating areas, her rating manager urged her to continue \naccepting and learning from constructive criticism, continue to assist her team in \nmanaging the daily workload, become a subject-matter expert on all administrative \nfunctions, and continue to provide excellent customer service.  (AE A) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified and sensitive information may only be granted \u201cupon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information (and implicitly sensitive information) within Industry \n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for holding a public trust position is predicated upon the applicant \nmeeting the criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not eligibility for holding \na public trust position should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines \ndo not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .

This relationship transcends normal \nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. Public trust eligibility decisions must be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, \n1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access classified or sensitive information. The Government has \nthe burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s public trust position suitability. See ISCR \nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance\u201d (implicitly public trust position eligibility as well). ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at \n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance (and \nimplicitly public trust eligibility) determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nTrustworthiness concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s history of accumulating \ndelinquent debts. Most of the debts involve delinquent student loans. Other debts \ninclude delinquent consumer accounts. \nJurisdictional issues \nHolding a public trust position involves the exercise of important fiducial \nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor in \nprotecting and guarding personally identifiable information (PII).

Applicant has made considerable \nprogress in addressing her debt delinquencies since returning to gainful employment in \nJanuary 2019. Important also to establishing a favorable whole-person evaluation is the \nhigh regard in which she is held by her manager and colleagues. Overall public trust \neligibility assessment of Applicant based on the compiled documentation and \ncorroborating testimony enables her to establish judgment and reliability levels sufficient \nto overcome trust concerns associated with her accumulation of delinquent debts over a \nthree-year period. \nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt accruals and ensuing probative efforts to pay off and resolve \nthem, conclusions are warranted that her finances are sufficiently stabilized to warrant \nfavorable conclusions about her eligibility to hold a public trust position.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did no mitigate financial concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 7, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 27, 2020 and elected to have her \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

Allegedly, \nthese debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the listed debts with \nexplanations. She claimed her consumer debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.d-1.e) were \ndischarged in her recent 2020 bankruptcy proceeding. (Item 1, attachment to \nApplicant\u2019s response) Addressing her delinquent student loan debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c), \nshe claimed she is making payments on her student loans since the discharge of her \nbankruptcy. \nApplicant further claimed that she and her husband have been paying their joint \nfederal tax debts owed for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) through \nvoluntary payments and IRS application of a scheduled refund for tax year 2015 to past-\nowed taxes. (Item 1, attachments to Applicant\u2019s response) And, Applicant further \nclaimed that she and her husband have been making payments on their delinquent joint \nstate tax debts for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018, and have since paid off all of the \ntaxes owed to the state taxing authority.

(Item 2) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nApplicant and her husband accumulated delinquent federal and state taxes for \ntax years 2015 and 2017-2018. (Item 3) Records document that she owed delinquent \nfederal taxes for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018 in the aggregate amount of $2,000. \n(Items 2-3) She accrued comparable delinquent taxes ($2,000) owed to her state of \nresidence for the same tax years of 2015 and 2017-2018. \nApplicant attributed her federal and state tax delinquencies to confusion and \nuncertainty over how to file her joint federal and state tax returns for the years in issue \nwithout her husband\u2019s cooperation. (Items 2-3) Evidently, she did not consult a tax \ncounselor until 2019. (Item 1, attachment to Applicant\u2019s response) \nIn 2017, Applicant leased a vehicle for $31,000 that carried monthly lease \npayments of $480. (Items 3-5) After being denied her request to the leasing to return the \nvehicle without charge due to mechanical issues, Applicant returned the vehicle anyway \nto the dealership in February 2017. (Item 3) She reported that the dealership accepted \nher return and informed her that she still owed $9,939 on the sales balance on the \nvehicle. (Items 3-5) \nIn February 2019, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (Item 1) \nShe received her bankruptcy discharge in September 2020. (Item 1, attachment to \nApplicant\u2019s response) She claimed without any schedule documentation that her three \nlisted delinquent consumer debts listed in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d-1.e) were \ndischarged in her 2020 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Item 1, attachment to Applicant\u2019s \nresponse) Without the included creditor schedules, discharge of these three SOR \nconsumer debts cannot be verified and credited to Applicant. \nClaiming her delinquent federal tax debts for tax years 2015, 2017, and 2018 \nwere set off by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2019 by applying an earmarked \nrefund for tax year 2015 to the owed taxes for tax year 2015, Applicant documented an \ninstallment agreement she completed with the IRS that left a $2,000 balance owing to \nthe service. (Item 1, attachments to Applicant\u2019s response). With the applied refund to \nthe balance owing for the 2015 tax year credited, Applicant was left with a balance \nowing for 2015 in the amount of $551. (Item 1, attachment to Applicant\u2019s response) \nWhether any remaining federal taxes are owed for tax year 2015 is not clear from \nApplicant\u2019s submissions. \nApplicant also supplied a payment summary from the IRS documenting monthly \npayments of $200 between November 2019 and May 2020 (totaling $1,400) that the \nIRS applied to Applicant\u2019s carried forward balance for tax year 2017.

(Item 1, attachments \nto Applicant\u2019s response) Based on her submissions, Applicant is entitled to credit for \nresolving her state tax debt. \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s history \nof financial difficulties warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) \nof the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies.  \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

Her undertaken initiatives enable her \nto take partial advantage of three mitigating conditions (MCs). MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u201cthe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medial emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d; and 20(d), \u201cthe individual \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts,\u201d partially apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant, however, has a considerable amount of work to cover in addressing \nand documenting the resolution of her delinquent debts and accounts before she can be \ncredited with stabilizing her finances sufficient to meet the eligibility requirements for \nholding a security clearance. This administrative record is lacking in schedules of the \nconsumer debts she claims were discharged in her Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. \nDocumentation is lacking as well of balances remaining on her 2015 and 2017-2018 \nfederal and state tax deficiencies. \nAnd while Applicant has evidenced her making voluntary $5.00 monthly \npayments to the DoE on her reported delinquent student loans, she has not provided \nany documentation of her having a rehabilitation agreement in place with the student \nloan creditor, or how long she must continue making her modest $5.00 monthly \npayments before she is eligible for rehabilitation and the opportunity to return her \ndelinquent student loans to current status. Clarification from Applicant of her \nrehabilitation status is needed before she can be credited with material progress in the \naddressing of her delinquent student loans. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \nsuch debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s \ncase, she is to be credited with some cognizable progress in addressing and resolving \nher listed debt delinquencies. It is still too soon, however to be able to make safe \npredictions about her ability to stabilize her finances to the extent necessary to fully \nmitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. In Applicant\u2019s case, she has provided some documented evidence \nof her addressing her delinquent consumer, student loan, and federal and state tax \ndebts. Overall, Applicant\u2019s efforts to date in addressing her finances and satisfying the \nrequirements of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in her professional and \npersonal life are not enough at this time to enable her to meet the minimum \nrequirements for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

At hearing, he testified that he made the required monthly payments on \nthose loans until about 2015 around the time of his most recent period of unemployment. \nApplicant has not made any payments on his student loans in the past six years. When \nasked why he did not resume his loan payments when he regained employment, he stated \nthat he forgot about them despite receiving notices from the creditors holding those loans. \nEventually, the federal government began diverting Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds each \nyear and Applicant considered those diversions as his \u201cpayment for the year.\u201d (GX 1; Tr. \n45, 50, 61 \u2013 62) \nThe credit reports presented by Department Counsel document all of the \ndelinquent debts addressed in the SOR.

In October 2016, he was interviewed by \na government investigator about his finances. After initially denying that he had any \naccounts that were in collection or more than 120 days past due, he was confronted with \nthe contents of a credit report dated December 16, 2017. Applicant then told the \ninvestigator that he did not list the student loans because he did not realize they \nconstituted debts to the federal government. He also stated that he was paying them on \na monthly basis. In response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was confused by the \nquestions at issue and did not intend to provide false answers to the questions about his \ndebts. At hearing, he testified that he either did not read the questions carefully or that he \ndid not pay attention to what was being asked by those questions.

He has not yet made any \npayments because he is availing himself of relief for student loan payments, regardless \nof whether they are current or delinquent, provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and \nEconomic Security (CARES) Act. I take administrative notice of the fact that in August \n2021, CARES Act protections were extended to January 2022. (GX 2; AX A; Tr. 50 \u2013 51, \n61 \u2013 62, 64 \u2013 66) \nApplicant has an excellent reputation in the workplace and his community. Four \ncurrent and former co-workers testified for Applicant. They have known him for most of \nthe past ten years and are aware of the financial and personal conduct issues in this case. \nThey have observed Applicant to be professional, reliable, honest and trustworthy. They \nalso have observed that he lives modestly and within his means, although those \nobservations are not based on any specific knowledge of his finances. (Tr. 22 \u2013 42) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government provided sufficient, reliable information to support the SOR \nallegations under Guideline F. Applicant has admitted those allegations. The facts \nestablished reasonably raise a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s information requires \nconsideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \nNone of these mitigating conditions can be applied here. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are recent, in that, he still owes more than $58,000 in delinquent student loans \nthat were subsidized by the federal government. He also owes another $3,000 for three \ncommercial debts. All of the debts alleged in the SOR have been delinquent for nearly \nfive years, but Applicant only began to address his debts less than a month before his \nhearing. After last paying on his student loans in 2015, he has yet to resume paying his \ndebts despite being asked about his debts during interviews in 2018 and 2019, when he \nstated his intent to contact his creditors and arrange repayment plans. Even after he \nreceived the SOR in April 2020, he apparently took no action to resolve his debts. \nApplicant legitimately is excused under the CARES Act from making any student loan \npayments until 2022; however, this does not excuse the fact that he ignored his debts for \nseveral years before the pandemic began. \nApplicant suggests that his debts arose from unforeseen circumstances when he \nwas laid off for six months in 2014 and 2016. He did not establish that he acted \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nresponsibly regarding his debts when he again found employment. Applicant also did not \nprovide any information showing he disputes any of the debts alleged or that he sought \nprofessional financial counseling to help resolve his financial problems. On balance, \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F. \nPersonal Conduct \nDespite Applicant\u2019s denial of SOR 2.a, there is sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegation under Guideline E. The facts established herein reasonably \nraise a security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct finances that is articulated at \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct requires application of AG \u00b6 16(a): \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAll available information probative of Applicant\u2019s intent when he completed his e-\nQIP shows that he decided to ignore the questions about his past-due debts. His claimed \nconfusion about the question is not credible. His negative answers to those questions \nwere not the result of mistake or misunderstanding. Inaccuracies resulting from a knowing \ndecision to gloss over those questions cannot be discarded as unintentional. At the very \nleast, Applicant did not intend to provide the government all of the financial information in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis background on which adjudicators would rely in assessing his suitability for continued \naccess to classified information. Also contributing to my assessment of Applicant\u2019s intent \nand credibility is the fact that he apparently lied to a government investigator during his \nfirst interview when he claimed he was making monthly payments on his student loans. \nHad that conduct been alleged in the SOR, it would require application of AG \u00b6 16(b): \ndeliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe record does not support application of any of these mitigating conditions. \nApplicant did not correct his omissions after submitting his e-QIP. When he was \ninterviewed a year later, he first denied owing any debts that were in collection, more than \n120 days past due, or otherwise delinquent. Even after being confronted with information \nabout his debts, he was less than honest about why he did not disclose them. Further, \nApplicant has not claimed that he omitted the adverse financial information pursuant to \nany qualified advice, and he did not support his claims that his omissions were the result \nof confusion or misunderstanding. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his debts is not a minor transgression. The \ngovernment must be able to rely on applicants to be candid at all times so that an accurate \nand well-informed assessment of the risks associated with granting access can be done. \nHis conduct also is recent, in that, even now he has provided conflicting and implausible \nexplanations for his failure to disclose his debts. His conduct in this regard continues to \nreflect adversely on his judgment and trustworthiness. On balance, Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his intentional failure to disclose his debts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The favorable information from his workplace associates is significant. \nNonetheless, it does not outweigh the negative effects of Applicant\u2019s persistent failure to \naddress his longstanding delinquent debts, or his intentional falsifications in response to \nthe government\u2019s questions about his background. The resulting security concerns \nremain unresolved and sustain doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued access \nto classified information. Because protection of the interests of national security is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

In December 1987, she \ngraduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. \nApplicant and her husband have been married since August 1990 and have three \nchildren, all now in their 20s.

Between August \n2013 and March 2015, Applicant worked as a software engineer for two companies not \ninvolved in the defense industry. She first received a security clearance in 2008 in \nconnection with her employment as a senior software engineer at a defense contractor \nbetween May 2007 and April 2013.

Even though the documents were not classified, most were proprietary \ndocuments containing sensitive information about Company B\u2019s development of systems \nfor its federal government customer. As such, company policy required that employees \nprotect those documents from unauthorized disclosure. Applicant was not authorized to \ntransmit the documents in question outside the control of Company B information \nsystems. Available information further shows that Applicant actually was fired from her \nCompany B position rather than leaving \u201cby mutual agreement.\u201d (FORM, Items 3, 4, 5, \nand 7) \nOn October 14, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by Company B security officials, \nwho asked Applicant if she had sent sensitive or proprietary information to her personal \nemail. At first, Applicant was evasive about her actions, admitting to sending one \ndocument. She then stated she sent \u201ca few\u201d documents, then \u201cfive\u201d documents. At that \ntime, after giving consent to search her Company B computer and employee email \naccount, Applicant was suspended pending completion of Company B\u2019s investigation. \nUltimately, 37 documents were identified as having been transmitted between April and \nOctober 2015 to four personal email accounts attributed to Applicant. She has claimed \nthat she was not truthful when interviewed because she felt intimidated by Company B \nofficials. In response to SOR Guideline E allegations, Applicant claims she was under \nduress during the Company B interview. (FORM, Items 3, 5, and 7) \nConcurrent with Company B\u2019s investigation, the FBI also investigated Applicant\u2019s \nactions as possible economic espionage. The investigation lasted from October 2015 until \nJanuary 2016, closing after the Department of Justice declined prosecution. During an \ninterview with FBI agents on January 7, 2016, Applicant confirmed that she had deleted \nfrom her email accounts, computer, and handheld devices, all of the files she had sent. \nThe FBI report of investigation further shows that Applicant was not truthful in October \n2015, when she was first interviewed by Company B officials. In her response to the SOR, \nApplicant claimed that the FBI agents informed her that Company B \u201cdid not handle this \nincident correctly, and has blown this incident out of proportion.\u201d Nothing in the FBI report \nor any other portion of this record supports her claim. (FORM, Items 5 and 8) \nOn April 25, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part \nof her background investigation. During that interview, Applicant stated that she did not \nunderstand that the information she emailed to herself needed to be protected in much \nthe same way as information that was actually classified. Further, and as she also stated \nin response to the SOR, Applicant averred that she had not received adequate training \nregarding protection of sensitive information. Finally, Applicant characterized her actions \nin sending 37 documents to her personal email accounts as \u201cinadvertent.\u201d (FORM, Items \n3 and 5) \n3 \n \nOn March 3, 2015, when she first began working at Company B, Applicant \nexecuted a \u201cConfidentiality and Innovation Agreement\u201d whereby she agreed that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation for which she might be responsible during her employment was sensitive, \nproprietary information, the unauthorized disclosure of which would be contrary to internal \ncompany policies and, potentially, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. At the outset of \nher employment with Company B, Applicant also completed extensive training in matters \nrelated to the protection of classified information as well as other sensitive and proprietary \ninformation. In response to the SOR, Applicant claims there has been no recurrence of \nthis type of conduct since 2015. She further avers that Company A, for whom she now \nworks, has given her the training and resources she needs to perform her duties without \nmishandling sensitive information. Applicant produced information that shows she has \nreceived numerous awards for her work at Company A; however, she did not provide any \ninformation that would corroborate her claims regarding training and resources. (FORM, \nItems 3, 6, and 7) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n4 \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \n\n \n \n \n \n \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \n \nAvailable information about Applicant\u2019s mishandling of sensitive information while \nemployed at Company B reasonably raises a security concern about her willingness and \nability to properly handle protected information. That concern is stated at AG \u00b6 33: \n \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information, which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information and proprietary information, raises doubts \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nBetween March and October 2015, Applicant knowingly transferred to her four \npersonal email accounts at least 37 documents containing information her employer \ndeemed as proprietary and sensitive to Company B\u2019s work in support of the federal \ngovernment. This information establishes the following AG \u00b6 34 disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; and \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nBy contrast, Applicant has claimed that her actions were inadvertent, and that \nCompany B did not provide her with the proper training and resources as she claims has \nbeen the case at Company A. Additionally, Applicant cites the passage of nearly six years \nwithout a recurrence of her actions at Company B. These claims require consideration of \nthe following AG \u00b6 35 mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nAll available information probative of these mitigating conditions leads me to \nconclude that none apply here. As to AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), 35(c) and 35(d), although six years \nhave elapsed without a recurrence of the events cited in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s \nmischaracterization in her e-QIP of the circumstances of her job termination and her \ncontinued false claims that her conduct was \u201cinadvertent\u201d undermine confidence in her \njudgment and reliability. It is beyond question that Applicant was fired and did not leave \nCompany B by mutual agreement. It is also beyond question that her actions were \ndeliberate and multiple. As to training, Applicant\u2019s conduct occurred over the seven \nmonths after she signed a \u201cConfidentiality and Innovation Agreement,\u201d and after she \nreceived extensive training in the protection of sensitive information when she began her \nemployment with Company B in March 2015. It is reasonable to conclude that she was \nadequately trained in procedures to protect sensitive and proprietary information, and that \nshe knew the information she emailed to herself was subject to those procedures. \nApplicant also is unable to benefit from application of AG \u00b6 35(b). She claims that \nher current employer, Company A, has provided her with better training and resources \nwith which to do her job while protecting information as required. However, Applicant did \nnot provide any information about that training, or about her adherence to security \nprocedures, from which to conclude that AG \u00b6 35(b) can be applied. On balance, \nApplicant failed to present information sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under \nthis guideline. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAvailable information shows that Applicant knowingly made false statements to \nCompany B officials when she was interviewed in March 2015. This information, as well \nas information about her mishandling of protected information, reasonably raises the \nsecurity concerns addressed at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information establishes the following AG \u00b6 16 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information. \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs to AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b), the record shows that when she was interviewed by \nCompany B officials, Applicant attempted to grossly minimize the actual scope of her \nmisconduct. It was not until she was suspended from work and those officials were able \nto search her company computer and email account that all 37 documents were identified. \nAdditionally, Applicant was not being advised in her answers by anyone authorized to do \nso. Finally, she has never herself corrected the misrepresentations she made during the \ninterview. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) do not apply. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply for the same reasons AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a) \u2013 35(d) do \nnot apply. Applicant continues to characterize her disclosures as inadvertent and as the \nproduct of insufficient training. She also did not support her claims regarding recent \ntraining (the equivalent of \u201ccounseling\u201d in AG \u00b6 17(d)) that might preclude a recurrence of \nher misconduct. On this issue, I have considered the fact that she falsified the nature of \nher Company B termination in her most recent e-QIP. She also insisted on characterizing \nher conduct as inadvertent, both in response to the SOR and during her subject interview \nin 2019. Although not alleged in the SOR, this information is relevant to an assessment \nof her current credibility and rehabilitation. Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns \nunder this guideline. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and K, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant received several \nawards for her work with Company A; however, she did not present necessary information \nabout her training and about her adherence to procedures for protection of sensitive \ninformation. Additionally, she made statements in response to the Government\u2019s \ninformation that continue to cast doubt on her judgement and trustworthiness. \nAccordingly, available information is not sufficient to resolve the doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance that have been raised by the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus in these adjudications, \nany remaining doubts must be resolved against allowing access to sensitive information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 40 years old. It is unclear whether she is an employee or a prospective employee of a defense contractor. She is applying for a security clearance for the first time. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which she earned in 2011, and additional college credits, but no post-graduate degree. The most recent information available indicates that she is married for the second time. She has a 15-year-old child. (Items 2, 3) Applicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleges eleven delinquent debts totaling about $27,400. The debts include four defaulted student loans totaling $19,240 and seven miscellaneous debts ranging from a $162 payday loan to a $2,825 medical debt. Applicant admitted owing all the debts. Applicant asserted that her student loans were being paid by garnishment, and then were consolidated. The credit reports support her assertions. The April 2019 credit report listed the four student loans with balances totaling $21,673, with the annotation: \u201cPaid by Garnishment.\u201d The December 2019 credit report listed the four student loans with balances totaling $19,240, which indicates that payments were made since the previous credit report.

Applicant responded to the SOR on May 6, 2020, and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on July 22, 2020. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on July 29, 2020. As of \nSeptember 1, 2020, she had not responded. The case was assigned to me on January \n26, 2021. The Government exhibits included in the FORM are admitted in evidence. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. It is unclear whether she is an employee or a \nprospective employee of a defense contractor. She is applying for a security clearance \nfor the first time. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which she earned in 2011, and additional \ncollege credits, but no post-graduate degree. The most recent information available \nindicates that she is married for the second time. She has a 15-year-old child. (Items 2, \n3) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleges eleven delinquent \ndebts totaling about $27,400. The debts include four defaulted student loans totaling \n$19,240 and seven miscellaneous debts ranging from a $162 payday loan to a $2,825 \nmedical debt. Applicant admitted owing all the debts. \n \n \nApplicant asserted that her student loans were being paid by garnishment, and \nthen were consolidated. The credit reports support her assertions. The April 2019 credit \nreport listed the four student loans with balances totaling $21,673, with the annotation: \n\u201cPaid by Garnishment.\u201d The December 2019 credit report listed the four student loans \nwith balances totaling $19,240, which indicates that payments were made since the \nprevious credit report. She also had student loans that were in deferment and not \nalleged in the SOR. The July 2020 credit report showed that she was current and in \ngood standing on all of her student loans. (Items 1-6)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the sudden death of her father in \n2013 and the associated funeral and burial expenses. She stated that \u201c[t]he year \nfollowing his death was a very rough time for [her] and [her] family and [they] went \nthrough a period of frivolous spending.\u201d She and her husband met with a bankruptcy \nattorney in 2014, who advised them to stop paying all of their debts, with the exception \nof car payments, rent, and utilities. They decided not to file bankruptcy. She indicated \nthat they paid some debts over the years, focusing on her husband\u2019s debts first, as he \nwould be taking over his family\u2019s business. She stated that she moved; she has a \nbetter-paying job; and their current bills are being paid. Other than her student loans, \nthere is no evidence that Applicant paid or is paying any of the other debts alleged in \nthe SOR. There is no evidence of financial counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \ndefaulted student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the sudden death of her father in \n2013 and the associated funeral and burial expenses. She also admitted that she went \nthrough a period of frivolous spending. Her student loans were being paid by \ngarnishment. However, court-ordered or otherwise involuntary means of debt resolution, \nsuch as garnishment, are entitled to less weight than means initiated and carried \nthrough by the debtor himself. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). She then consolidated the student loans. She is now current and in good \nstanding on all of her student loans. The allegations related to her student loans are \nmitigated. \nWith the exception of the student loans, there is no evidence that Applicant paid \nor is paying any of the debts alleged in the SOR. She did not present a plan to resolve \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher financial problems, and she does not have a sufficient track record to enable me to \ntrust that she will pay her debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that \nher financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find \nthat she acted responsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort \nto pay her debts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant may \nreach a point where her finances are sufficiently in order to warrant a security \nclearance, but she has not established that she is there at this time. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. at 22-31; AE A1-A4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant parents and brother are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant \nand his wife own adjacent properties in Pakistan with an estimated value in U.S. dollars \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof about $25,000 each. The potential for terrorist and other violence against U.S. \ninterests and citizens remains high in Pakistan, and it continues to have human rights \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and assets create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Pakistan. Guideline B is not limited \nto countries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding sensitive information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife came to the United States in 2015 and became U.S. \ncitizens in 2019. His children were born in the United States, and his daughter is buried \nhere. His mother-in-law is a U.S. citizen and resident, and he petitioned for his parents \nand brother to immigrate to the United States. He expressed his undivided allegiance to \nthe United States, which he considers his home. He credibly testified that his family and \nfinancial interests in Pakistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Pakistan are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the \ninterests of Pakistan. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable, and AG \u00b6 8(f) is partially applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated, and in it he elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on January 8, \n2021.

There \nwere no objections to any of the evidence offered, and it is admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on March 4, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f and 1.h, which he \ndenied. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is a high school graduate and has earned some \ncollege credits, but not a degree. He was married in 2009 and divorced in 2012. He has \na child from the marriage. He was in the Marine Corps Reserve from 2009 to 2014, when \nhe was discharged due to unsatisfactory performance in the ready reserves. His \ndischarge was under other than honorable conditions. He has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since March 2019. \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m) totaling approximately $36,101. \nThese debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in the SOR; disclosures and \nadmissions in his security clearance application (SCA) from April 2019; his admissions \nduring his May 2019 background interview; and credit reports dated April 2019 and \nNovember 2019. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he disclosed the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e, 1.g, 1.i. and 1.j. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is for delinquent child support. \nApplicant stated in his background interview with a government investigator that the state \nwhere he resides automatically withholds child support payments from his paycheck. This \nis how the state processes such payments. When he changed jobs his child support \npayments stopped because his new employer did not take action to withhold the \npayments. Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund was involuntary applied to the delinquent \nchild support balance. Applicant provided documentary proof dated February 2020 that \nthis debt is resolved. (Items 1, 2, 3) \nConcerning the delinquent debts, Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he was either \nmaking monthly payments or was planning to make monthly payments and the debts \nwould be resolved by the end of the year (2019). When he was interviewed in May 2019, \nhe said he was either making small payments towards many of the alleged debts and \nthey would be resolved by the end of the year; was working with the creditor to settle the \ndebt; would start making payments soon; or would pay the debt by the end of the year. \n(Items 2, 3) \n \n \n \n2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR for those debts he admitted he owed, he \nindicated he had payments arrangements. He said he was to pay as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a- \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$300 a month; \u00b6 1.b-$67 a month; \u00b6 1.c-$50 a month; \u00b6 1.e-$40 a month; \u00b6 1.g-$40 a \nmonth; \u00b6 1.i-$20 a month; \u00b6 1.j-$75 a month; \u00b61.k-$25 a month; and \u00b61.l-$50 a month. \nIn Applicant\u2019s FORM response, he said he had one more payment to resolve the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($599) and a couple of payments to resolve \u00b6 1.i ($718). He also stated \nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g were the only remaining debts to be \npaid. He did not provide documentary proof to support his assertions. (Item 1; AE A) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a repossessed vehicle from 2015, he \nexplained in his SOR answer that he returned the vehicle to the dealership when he could \nno longer make the payments. He received a letter from the bank and a lawyer regarding \nthe debt, but he did not pay it. He has some questions about the balance owed. It is not \nresolved. (Items 1, 2, and 3). \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant provided copies of receipts from January to March \n2020 to show he made payments towards the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \n($1,374) and 1.h ($921) His receipts reflect four payments totaling $1,147. In his response \nto the FORM, he provided a receipt ($288) that he said was for the medical debt in \u00b6 1.l \n($338). Applicant claimed that these payments resolved the debts, but did not provide \ncorroborating documentation that his lesser payments had fully satisfied the debts or were \naccepted as settlements for the debts. Insufficient evidence was provided to resolve these \ndebts. (Item 1; AE A, B) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided a receipt from September 2020 \nto show the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m was paid in full. It is resolved. (AE C). \nApplicant told the government investigator that his financial problems began in \nDecember 2012 when his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and he took out two loans \nto help the family (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). He made payments on the loans until sometime \nin 2013 when he switched jobs and could no longer afford to pay them. He said he was \n\u201cyoung and dumb\u201d and stopped the payments. Other accounts that became delinquent \nwere for credit cards used for his personal purchases, cell phone accounts, and medical \nexpenses. (Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2013 that are not paid or resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in about 2013 when he stopped \nmaking payments on loans and other accounts that then became delinquent. He stated \nhe took two loans out to help his family after his mother was diagnosed with cancer. When \nhe changed jobs he could not afford the loan payments. In his 2019 SCA, he stated most \nof the debts would be paid by the end of the year. Applicant did not take action to pay any \nof his debts until early 2020 when he made some payments towards medical debts. He \nindicated the medical debts were resolved, but did not provide sufficient proof to conclude \nhis payments have resolved the debts. In his answer to the SOR, he stated he had \npayments agreements with his creditors, but did not provide proof that he was making \nregular monthly payments in compliance with agreements. He provided proof that he has \nresolved his child support debt and one other debt that is paid in full. \nApplicant failed to take action on his debts until after he applied for a security \nclearance. In 2012, he obtained two loans to help his family, but he failed to act \nresponsibly when he changed jobs and stopped making payments in 2013. He stated he \nis making payments to resolve his other delinquent debts, but failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentary proof. Due to the age of the debts, and Applicant\u2019s lack of action on \nresolving them for many years, his conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s illness was a circumstance beyond his control that impacted \nhis finances, but he did not act responsibly when he changed jobs and stopped making \npayments on the two loans he owed. He also accumulated other delinquent debts. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. There is no evidence he has received financial \ncounseling. Applicant has made payments on a couple of his medical debts, but \ninsufficient evidence was provided to conclude they are resolved. He stated he has \npayment plans to resolve his other delinquent debts, but failed to provide documentary \nproof of the agreements or that he is in compliance and making regular payments. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply as Applicant has not received financial counseling and there are not \nclear indications Applicant\u2019s financial issues are under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \n\u00b6 1.m. It does not apply to the remaining debts alleged as the evidence does not support \nthat Applicant is adhering to a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant also has numerous debts that have been delinquent for many years. He \nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness, late student loans, and \nallegedly failed to file income taxes for tax year 2016. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(c) the individual has received financial counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source . . . and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has addressed and/or paid the vast majority of her past-due \nindebtedness and student loans. She has only two debts, totaling about $420 that she \nmay have yet to address. Applicant has received financial counseling. She has \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.ff:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

This allegation is found for Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a plethora of late tax filings, significant back-taxes; and significant \npast-due-student loans, private loans and a car loan. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his financial problems to failed marriages, \nperiods of unemployment, and family deaths, his financial difficulties are ongoing. He \nhas a long history of delinquencies. He has only recently addressed these past-due \ntaxes and debts, which is too little too late. He has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nperforms well at his job. (AppXs L and M.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.v. and 1.w: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.x: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:   \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information.

Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She has failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Two are former residents of the UAE currently residing in \nPakistan.\u201d \nPakistan \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. Historically, constitutionalism and \nparliamentary democracy have fared poorly in Pakistan, marked by tripartite power \nstruggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. The country has endured \ndirect military rule for nearly half of its 72 years of independence, interspersed with \nperiods of generally weak civilian governance. \nThe Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is Level 3: Reconsider \nTravel, due to COVID-19, terrorism, and sectarian violence. U.S. citizens are advised \nnot to travel to certain areas of the country due to terrorism, kidnapping, and the \npotential for armed conflict. \nPakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups, and \nsuccessive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even \nsupported some of these as proxies in Pakistan\u2019s historical conflicts with its neighbors. \nLocal history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist \nelements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSince 2001, U.S. policy has broadly been to assist the creation of a more stable, \ndemocratic, and prosperous Pakistan that actively combats religious militancy. A key \nU.S. ally in combatting terrorism after September 11, 2001, Pakistan has since been a \nleading recipient of U.S. assistance, receiving more than $30 billion in aid and military \nreimbursements. The United States continues to press for decisive and irreversible \naction against externally-focused militant groups and UN-designated terrorist \norganizations operating from its territory; pending such action, security assistance from \nthe United States to Pakistan remains suspended. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npolice targets. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the \npast. \nKidnapping is a concern throughout Pakistan. Extremist groups and criminals \nhave targeted business owners and prominent families to finance terror operations and \nprofit through ransom. U.S. citizens and foreign nationals working for non-government \norganizations have been targets, and U.S. citizens have been kidnapped in other \ncountries and held in Pakistan. The U.S. Government has a limited ability to provide \nemergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. \nHuman rights issues in Pakistan have included credible reports of extrajudicial \nand targeted killings; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary and lengthy pretrial \ndetention; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; censorship, site-blocking, and \narbitrary restrictions on journalists\u2019 freedom of movement; severe harassment and \nintimidation of and high-profile attacks against journalists and media organizations; \ngovernment restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly and association, including \noverly restrictive nongovernmental organizations laws; restrictions on religious freedom \nand discrimination against members of religious minority groups; restrictions on freedom \nof movement; corruption within the government; recruitment and use of child soldiers by \nnon-state militant groups; lack of criminal investigations or accountability for cases \nrelated to rape, sexual harassment, so-called honor crimes, female genital \nmutilation/cutting, and violence based on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation; \nlegal prohibitions of consensual same-sex sexual conduct; forced and bonded labor and \ntransnational trafficking in persons; and the worst forms of child labor. In 2019, \nauthorities seldom punished government officials for human rights abuses. \nUAE \nThe UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates-- Abu Zaby \n(Abu Dhabi), \u2018Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah (Sharjah), Dubayy (Dubai) Ra\u2019s al \nKhaymah, and Ummal Qaywayn. The rulers of the seven emirates constitute the \nFederal Supreme Council, the country\u2019s highest legislative and executive body. The \nemirates are under political rule with political allegiance defined by loyalty to tribal \nleaders, leaders of the individual emirates, and leaders of the federation. \nThe United States has had friendly relations with the UAE since 1971, and the \ntwo countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1972. The UAE plays an \ninfluential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the United States.

The U.S. Department of State has assessed Abu Dhabi and Dubai as being a \nmedium-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government \ninterests. The continued threat posed by terrorist groups seeking to target U.S. interests \nrequires those working or traveling in the UAE to remain vigilant, maintain a low profile, \nand vary routes, times, and routines while in the country. \nThe UAE is a drug transshipment point for traffickers given its proximity to \nSouthwest Asian drug-producing countries; the UAE\u2019s position as a major financial \ncenter makes it vulnerable to money laundering; anti-money-laundering controls are \nimproving, but informal banking remains unregulated. Through transshipment and \ndiversion, U.S. goods, dual-use, military and electronic components, and internet \ntechnology have passed through the UAE and UAE-owned businesses on their way to \nforbidden destinations, including Iran and Syria. \nThe most significant human rights issues in the UAE in 2019 included allegations \nof torture in detention; arbitrary arrest and detention, including incommunicado \ndetention, by government agents; political prisoners; government interference with \nprivacy rights; undue restrictions on free expression and the press, including \ncriminalization of libel, censorship, and internet site blocking; substantial interference \nwith the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; the inability of citizens \nto choose their government in free and fair elections; and criminalization of same sex \nsexual activity. \nFindings of Fact \n4 \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 40 years old. He was a \nPakistani citizen born in the UAE. His parents, both Pakistani-born citizens, lived in the \nUAE because his father started working as an electrician there in the 1970s. Applicant, \nalong with his mother and siblings, moved to Pakistan when he was in the 10th grade of \nhigh school; his father continued to live and work in the UAE. He graduated from high \nschool in Pakistan in 1999. In 2000, at age 19, Applicant emigrated from Pakistan to the \nUnited States on a student visa. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information \nsystems in 2007. He married a native-born U.S. citizen, who he met in college, in 2009, \nand they have three minor children, all of whom were born in the United States. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen and was issued a U.S. passport in November 2012. \nApplicant is a cyber-engineer, and he has worked for his current employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since 2018. He has never held a security clearance. (Answer; Tr. at 7-8, 61-\n142; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s siblings are Pakistani citizens. As of the date of the hearing, his 35-\nyear-old brother resided in the UAE; two of his sisters, ages 38 and 34, who previously \nresided in the UAE, resided in Pakistan; and his 29-year-old sister resided in the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s brother works for a U.S.-based insurance company in the UAE. His \n38-year-old sister lives with her second spouse in Pakistan. His 34-year-old sister, along \nwith her spouse and children, moved to Pakistan in late 2020.

(Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2; AE B, C, D, E) \nApplicant maintains quarterly telephonic and electronic contact with his siblings. \nHe gave wedding gifts of approximately $500 to his 34-year-old sister in 2009, $400 to \nhis 29-year-old sister in 2017, and $400 each to his brother and 38-year-old sister in \n2021. He has never financially supported his siblings. Applicant petitioned to the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, for his \nbrother in the UAE and sisters in Pakistan to move to the United States in 2015; as of \nthe date of the hearing, his petitions were pending. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2; AE B, C, D, \nE) \nApplicant testified that his 38-year-old sister\u2019s husband works for an oil company \nin Pakistan; Applicant spoke to him once, which was before he married Applicant\u2019s \nsister in 2021. Applicant was unaware who his 34-year-old sister\u2019s husband\u2019s employer \nwas in Pakistan, but stated that he previously worked for a U.S.-based shipping \ncompany in the UAE. Applicant was unaware of any family members in Pakistan having \nworked for the Pakistani government or military. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s 67-year-old parents, who he sponsored to move to the United States, \nare permanent U.S. residents, who have lived with him since approximately 2016. They \nintend to apply for U.S. citizenship once they are eligible to do so. His father is retired, \nalthough he recently began delivering pizzas to stay active. His mother has always been \na stay-at-home wife and mother. Since moving to the United States, they have traveled \nto Pakistan twice and the UAE once, all without Applicant. In 2017, they traveled to \nPakistan to attend Applicant\u2019s 29-year-old sister\u2019s wedding; they also provided her \napproximately $5,000 to help her pay for her wedding. In early 2021, they traveled to \nthe UAE to attend Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s wedding, and they also traveled to Pakistan to \nattend Applicant\u2019s 38-year-old sister\u2019s wedding. They provided $1,000 to his brother and \n$2,000 to this sister to help pay for their respective 2021 weddings. Applicant chose not \nto travel to the UAE or Pakistan in 2021 to attend these siblings\u2019 weddings, because he \nhad already been notified that his connection with his siblings could potentially affect his \nability to obtain a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s parents stay with Applicant\u2019s aunt and \nuncle during their trips to Pakistan. His uncle is a cloth weaver and the women in his \nfamily have never worked outside the home. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2; AE F) \nPrior to becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant traveled to Pakistan twice--in 2004 to \nvisit his family, and in 2009, with his wife, to attend his 34-year-old sister\u2019s wedding. \nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, he has traveled to the UAE twice and to Pakistan once, \nall on his U.S. passport. He relinquished his previous Pakistani passports to his \nprevious employer for destruction in 2015. He traveled to the UAE in 2012 to visit his \nparents, who lived there at the time. He again traveled to the UAE in 2016. Initially, he \nplanned this UAE trip to attend his brother\u2019s wedding; he chose to proceed with this trip \nbecause he only received notice, two days before he was scheduled to depart the \nUnited States, that his brother\u2019s wedding was postponed. In 2019, he joined his father in \nPakistan to visit his ill grandmother and attend his cousin\u2019s wedding; he reported this \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrip to his employer.

After he completed the project, he \ndeliberately did not meet with his brother or sister in the UAE on his return home, \nbecause he had already been notified that they presented a potential security concern. \nWhile in Saudi Arabia, between 2018 and December 2020, he briefly met a cousin, who \nworks for a Saudi oil or gas company, for lunch. He had not seen this cousin in years \nand he has not since had further contact with this cousin. (Tr. at 16-142; GE 2) \n \nApplicant stated that his wife, children, and career in the United States are most \nimportant to him. He stated that his parents are aware that he works in the IT field for a \nDOD contractor, and he has talked with them about not discussing his employment with \nanyone. His siblings are only aware that he works in the IT field. He stated that he has \nundergone annual security training with his employment, and he has been trained to \nreport to the proper authorities any attempt by anyone to use his siblings in the UAE \nand Pakistan to exert any influence on him. He stated, \u201cI would never compromise the \nU.S. security for anything,\u201d and: \nAnd [the United States] has given me so much . . . I was born in Abu \nDhabi, never a citizen. . . . even though I went to Pakistan, I never felt like \nI belonged there because it was never my country. I got it through my \nparents, but I never really basically lived there. Or the only reason I had to \ngo was because that\u2019s the passport I had at that time . . . . So [the United \nStates] is where I came and basically accepted me. Basically when I came \nhere in the U.S., in the country, and I grew -- I grew here. I learned here. I \nwas -- I became independent. And I mean all my hard work, I studied. I \nmean this is where I basically -- as far as I remember, this is where I see \nmyself and my roots and all that. And I have no intention ever to go back \nto any country. \n(Tr. at 16-142; GE 1) \nApplicant purchased his home in the United States for approximately $515,000 in \n2016. As of January 2021, he paid his $400,000 mortgage in full, and the value of his \nhome, as of the date of the hearing, was approximately $600,000. He owns three cars \nthat have a combined value of approximately $20,000. He earns a base salary of \napproximately $192,000 annually, which can increase to approximately $300,000 \nannually when he is assigned overseas for work. He has $60,000 in his bank accounts, \nand he has around $190,000 in his retirement savings accounts. He also sets aside \nmoney in a 529 college savings plan for his children.

(Tr. at 16-142; GE 1; AE A, G, H, I). \nPrior to Applicant\u2019s parents moving in with him in 2016, Applicant provided them \na total of approximately $130,000 in financial support over the course of 10 to 15 years. \nHe sent them money \u201cevery now and then,\u201d and then he gave them $100,000 that they \nused to buy land and build a home in Pakistan, with the intention that they would retire \nthere. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s parents still owned their home and land \nin Pakistan, and Applicant estimated their value was $100,000 USD each. He stated \nthat his parents were renting their home in Pakistan, the income from which is used by \nhis aunt and uncle in Pakistan to maintain the home and land.

He stated that he has no standing to inherit his \nparents\u2019 home or land in Pakistan since his life is in the United States, and his parents \nintend to pass it on to his siblings in Pakistan. He stated that his parents do not have \nany further foreign assets or investments. (Tr. at 16-142; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s three character witnesses attested to his loyalty to the United States, \ntrustworthiness, and integrity. Two witnesses, who have been friends with Applicant \nsince approximately 2000, described Applicant as a straightforward and honest \nindividual. The third witness, an individual who previously served honorably in the U.S. \nmilitary for over 11 years and helped hire Applicant in 2018, has held a Top \nSecret/Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance since 2006. This witness \ntestified that he and Applicant lived and worked closely together in Saudi Arabia for 8 to \n10 months, during the 2.5 year-long project discussed above, and after 8 to 10 months, \nthe witness returned to the United States and entrusted Applicant as his lead engineer \nto complete the project. This witness described Applicant as an outstanding employee \nand consistently his top performer. \nLetters of support from a number of individuals, to include a retired U.S. Air Force \nlieutenant colonel who was an executive director for Applicant\u2019s employer and held a \nTop Secret security clearance, as well as another individual who has been Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor since 2018 and also a retired U.S. military officer of \u201cover 21 years,\u201d and \nthree other individuals who have had 20-year-long friendships with Applicant, attest to \nhis integrity, tireless work ethic, leadership, and humility. The supervisor, who also \nworked with Applicant on the overseas work project, wrote, I have no reason to question \nhis patriotism, loyalty, character, or witnessed any personal conditions that would lead \nme to suspect any questionable intent or risk.\u201d (Answer; Tr. at 16-61; AE A). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s 29-year-old sister, while a Pakistani citizen, became a permanent \nU.S. resident in early 2021. She lives in the United States with her husband and they \nown and operate several gas stations in their state. However, Applicant\u2019s brother, a \nPakistani citizen, resides in the UAE, and Applicant\u2019s two sisters, also Pakistani citizens \nwho formerly resided in the UAE, reside in Pakistan.

He also saw his brother and one sister in the UAE \nthree times between 2018 to 2019, during layovers on his return trip to the United \nStates from an assigned work project in Saudi Arabia. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, who have lived with Applicant since around 2016, maintain \ncontact with their children in the UAE and Pakistan. They traveled to Pakistan in 2017 \nand 2021, and to the UAE in 2021, to attend those children\u2019s weddings. They also \nprovided between $1,000 and $5,000 to help those children pay for their respective \nweddings. His parents also intend to pass on the profits from the sale of their home and \nland in Pakistan, which have a combined total value of approximately $200,000 USD, to \nApplicant\u2019s siblings in Pakistan. Concerns of terrorism, sectarian violence, kidnapping, \nthe potential for armed conflict, and human rights exist in Pakistan. The continued threat \nposed by terrorist groups seeking to target U.S. interests remains a concern in the UAE. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant, and his parents who live with him, maintain regular contact with his \nsiblings in the UAE and Pakistan, as previously discussed. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a or 1.b. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s foreign siblings are affiliated with the UAE or Pakistani \ngovernment or military. Applicant has never financially supported his foreign siblings. He \npetitioned for them to move to the United States in 2015. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the UAE and Pakistan against his ties to the United States. The \nconcerns over Applicant\u2019s ties to the UAE and Pakistan, through his foreign siblings, do \nnot create doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand ability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), and 8(b) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a \nand 1.b. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this \nguideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 2) Applicant held a security clearance while in the military. (Item 2) Financial The SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i alleged nine delinquent debts, consisting of overpayments by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an automobile loan, consumer and medical accounts, all totaling $25,814. Applicant attributes her financial problems to under employment and unemployment for several months in 2017 and for three months in 2019. In her security clearance application, she noted several short periods of unemployment and seeking assistance to \u201cclean up her credit\u201d. However, she noted that she had not actually started with a counseling company due to not making the first payment for their services.

Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that \nApplicant has not mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with the exception of \nSOR 1.b, with no explanation.  She is 31 years old. Applicant has never married, and \ndoes not have any children. After graduation from high school, she served on active \nduty in the U.S. Navy from 2007 until her honorable discharge in 2012. (Item 2).  \nApplicant completed her most recent security clearance application in September 2017. \nShe has worked for her current employer as an aircraft servicer since May 2019. (Item \n2) Applicant held a security clearance while in the military. (Item 2) \nFinancial \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i alleged nine delinquent debts, consisting of overpayments by \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an automobile loan, consumer and \nmedical accounts, all totaling $25,814. Applicant attributes her financial problems to \nunder employment and unemployment for several months in 2017 and for three months \nin 2019. In her security clearance application, she noted several short periods of \nunemployment and seeking assistance to \u201cclean up her credit\u201d. However, she noted that \nshe had not actually started with a counseling company due to not making the first \npayment for their services. (Item 6) \nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, Applicant has medical collections accounts totaling \n$2,271. She acknowledged that they became delinquent in 2019 due to catching up on \nother bills. (Item 6) In her subject interview she stated that she would contact the \ncompanies and start a payment plan. There is no documentation to support her claim. \nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.g, Applicant acknowledges that they are VA overpayments \u2013 \nrelating to a school loan and that Applicant used the money for personal expenses \nrather than tuition. She provided a payment plan for the VA accounts but has not \nprovided proof of any payments. (Item 6) She thought tax return payments were going \nto her accounts. In her credit report (Item 5) there is proof that she made some \npayments, but has not made any recent payments. The issue is not resolved. \nApplicant admits the debt in SOR 1.h for an account that is past due in the \namount of $523, with a loan balance of $21,696. This is a for a car loan. She has not \nbeen able to make any car payments. (Item 6) Her credit report shows that the account \nis now in collection. (Item 5) \nAs to SOR 1.i, a charged-off account in the amount of $1,271, she has not been \nable to make payments on this credit card. She stated that she tries to make a payment \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen she can.

She will not buy another car as expensive as the \none that she purchased. (Item 6) At that point she admitted that she had not received \nany financial counseling or sought debt consolidation. \nThere is no information in the file concerning Applicant\u2019s income or any evidence \nof a budget. She mentioned loss of income from a partner, but she did not elaborate. \nThere are no character references. Applicant did not respond to the FORM to \nsupplement the record with any mitigating information. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her record and her credit reports, \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nApplicant admitted, and her credit reports confirm, that she is still indebted for the \nalleged SOR accounts. She has not received financial counseling and stated that she is \nwilling to pay and make payment plan arrangements, but she has not provided any \ndocumentary evidence to receive mitigation. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable because she \ndoes not have her finances under control. \nApplicant provided no credible nexus as to the short periods of unemployment \nand her inability to pay her debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but she did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s inaction regarding the debts precludes a conclusion that her finances \nare mitigated. She did not receive credit counseling. AG\u00b6 20 (c) does not apply. She \nmade some payment plan for the VA overpayments but has not provided proof of \nconsistent or current payments. AG\u00b6 20(d) partially applies. Due to the lack of evidence \nsubmitted by Applicant, it is impossible to conclude she made sufficient good-faith effort \nto resolve her debts or that her financial situation is under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant served in the U.S. military, receiving an honorable discharge in 2012. \nShe obtained her high school diploma in 2012. She has had various jobs. She has been \nemployed with her current employer since May 2019. The debts are from as far back as \n2015. On balance, Applicant did not produce information sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns about her finances. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with some questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Based \non the record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 68-year-old operations research analyst who has worked in the same \npositon since January 2019. For a previous employer, he gained about a decade of \nexperience in that same area. Applicant has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics \nand a master\u2019s degree in operations research. Applicant has maintained a security \nclearance since 1974. He was honorably discharged from the United States military in the \n1990s after 21 years of service. Divorced, he has one grown child. \nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s then-current wife opened a restaurant. (Tr. 18) She had \npreviously gained experience in the catering business and was active in the hospitality \nministry at her church, but she had no prior experience as a restauranteur. Applicant often \nhelped with the restaurant after his regular work day. An accountant was hired to file the \nbusiness\u2019 tax returns, as well as the wife\u2019s personal taxes. (Tr. 20) From the beginning, \nthe restaurant operated at a loss for various reasons. (Tr. 20-21) This continued until at \nleast 2013. Meanwhile, Applicant tapped into his savings and retirement account to help \nthe business. (Tr. 23) He now estimates that he lost about $200,000 of personal funds on \nthe venture. \nIn 2014, the restaurant was closed, following the marital separation of Applicant \nand his now-former spouse. As a result, Applicant was paying for both his home and a \nseparate residence for his estranged wife. Around that time, the accountant informed the \ncouple that there were insufficient receipts and documents to permit the filing of tax \nreturns related to the business. This started a \u201csnowball effect\u201d in the late filing of tax \nreturns for both the business and the couple. (Tr. 24) Ultimately, the restaurant\u2019s and \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 federal tax return would not be filed until 2020, after more documents \nwere discovered in 2014 and thereafter. (Tr. 27) \nThe couple got the help of another tax preparer in late 2018 or early 2019 to \ncomplete their individual tax returns. Applicant testified that the new preparer filed their \nindividual tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019. (Tr. 28, 34-36; Exs. B, I-K) In \naddition, Applicant\u2019s tax year 2020 tax returns were filed. In the end, Applicant owed \napproximately $20,000 for tax years 2019 and 2020, including interest and penalties. (Tr. \n33) He attributes some of this sum to the fact he cannot take an exemption for either his \nex-wife or his grandchild, although he provides them with financial support. He has filed \nto satisfy this sum through instalment payments over a 60-month period. (Tr. 29-30, 41, \n45; Ex. B) To date, one payment has been made. (Tr. 41) His state taxes have also been \nfiled. (Tr. 37, 41-42, 46-47; Exs. D, F, N) He has been in repayment with the state \nregarding past-due sums since 2020.

Soon thereafter, an \namicable divorce was executed. Applicant continues to support his ex-wife financially. (Tr. \n25) This amounts to about $2,000 a month to help pay for her car, rent, and support of \ntheir grandchild. (Tr. 26, 60) He is not subject to court-ordered alimony. During the recent \npandemic, he has occasionally helped his son compensate for reduced wages by giving \nhim $500-$600 a month. (Tr. 61-62) At the end of each month, Applicant has a net \nremainder of about $1,000 to $2,000. He also has a retirement account with a balance of \napproximately $60,000. (Tr. 63) He recently increased his tax withholding through payroll. \n(Tr. 65-65) \n \n \n  \n \nIn sum, Applicant earns a salary from his employer of approximately $170,000 a \nyear, has a military retirement package of about $50,000 a year, and receives about \n$30,000 a year from Social Security. (Tr. 29; Ex. B) He rents his home. Other than the \ntax issues noted above, the following delinquent debts are reflected in the SOR: \n1.a \u2013 Charged-off account ($72,549) \u2013 Status unknown - This account is related to \na secondary mortgage. It was for an equity line of credit from Applicant\u2019s primary \nresidence, which was initially purchased in 2003. (Tr. 49) The line of credit was created \nbefore Applicant\u2019s wife opened her restaurant. The line of credit was used in about 2005 \nor 2006 to pay off credit cards. (Tr. 50) The home was ultimately subject to a refinance, \nthen later sold through short sale in 2016 after failing to sell after two years. (Tr. 51) It \nwas Applicant\u2019s understanding that the short sale satisfied his outstanding loans related \nto the property. (Tr. 52-53) He has not heard from any of the entities financially tethered \nto the property since the short sale. (Tr. 54) There is no documentation showing any \nattempts to ascertain the account\u2019s current balance or status. Consequently, the \naccount\u2019s current status remains unclear. \n1.b \u2013 Charged-off credit card ($14,328) \u2013 Settled - This obligation became \ndelinquent due to the failing restaurant. The debt was settled by the creditor, which offered \nto end the matter for a lesser amount. (Tr. 56) That offer was accepted and satisfied by \nApplicant. (Tr. 55; Ex. D-E) Applicant received an IRS 1099 form for this settlement, which \nwas submitted with Applicant\u2019s 2020 federal tax return. (Tr. 55) \n1.c \u2013 Charged-off account ($3,219) \u2013 One repayment payment made - Applicant \ninitiated contact with this creditor in the past year. He has made a $500 payment toward \nthe balance. The creditor said \u201cthey will take payments as [he makes] them.\u201d (Tr. 57; Ex. \nF) He is planning on paying off the remaining balance in the next few months. (Tr. 57) He \nwas unable to initiate a structured repayment plan because the account was so old. (Tr. \n58) Applicant provided documentation reflecting a payment in 2015. (Ex. L) The last \nknown date of activity on the account was in 2016.

Applicant testified that after locating some missing Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) W2 forms, tax returns for 2013-2019 were filed in 2020. (see, e.g., \nTr. 34-36, 39) He provided evidence reflecting that filings for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, \nand 2018 were accepted. (Exs. I-K) He provided no such documentation for tax year \n2017. \n1.e \u2013 Federal tax debt in the amount of approximately $22,630 for tax years 2014, \n2015, 2017, and 2018 \u2013 Initial repayment made - See above. In addition, Applicant \ntestified that he is in repayment through an instalment plan with the IRS on amounts owed. \n(Tr. 41; Ex. B) The first payment toward this balance was paid the same week as the \nhearing. (Tr. 41, 45) It is his intent to complete payments on any outstanding balance. \n1.f \u2013 State tax debt in the amount of approximately $8,292 for tax years 2013 \u2013 \n2018 \u2013 In repayment - Applicant has been in repayment on this debt. (Tr. 42; Ex. D) He \nprovided documentation showing his 2020 filing was received. He submitted paperwork \nreflecting $1,645 was due to the state. Applicant\u2019s exhibit D shows past payments to the \nstate \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant has \ndelinquent debts and that he failed to file federal and state tax returns for multiple years. \nThis is sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n. \nUnder these facts, four conditions could mitigate related security concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling\nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit\ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control, and  \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s tax years 2013-2018 federal and state tax returns were not filed until \nlate 2018 or early 2019, after hiring a new accountant. It is unclear why the recruitment \nof this new accountant took so long. It should, however, help assure that future tax returns \nare properly and timely filed, raising AG \u00b6 20(a) in part.  \nWhile Applicant also attributed the delay in the filing of these tax returns to an \ninability to timely gather all relevant documents, he failed to fully explain why or how these \ndocuments became so scattered. As for the tax filings and debts related to the restaurant \nand to any personal financial repercussions related to that venture, it cannot be said that \nhis now-former wife\u2019s undertaking a potentially risky business venture was a circumstance \nbeyond his control, obviating application of AG \u00b6 20(b) \nThere is no documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant has received financial \ncounseling. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. As for resolving the tax and financial \nissues raised in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s documentation is incomplete. It is unclear whether \nthe IRS has accepted his tax return for tax year 2017. The status of the line of credit noted \nin SOR allegation 1.a is unclear and there is no documentation showing a pattern of \nregular and timely payment on the debt at 1.c. Only the debt at SOR allegation 1.b \nappears to be fully addressed, albeit through the creditor\u2019s offer to settle the obligation. \nMeanwhile, status of the federal tax return for 2017 remains unclear and the sole payment \nmade toward the approximately $22,000 debt was made the same week as the hearing, \nbringing into question whether the motivation behind this singular gesture was to start \nsatisfying the obligation or to initiate a last minute gesture of attention to an issue in the \nSOR. He only started paying his state tax burden sometime last year, in 2020. At best, \nAG \u00b6 20(d) only applies in part. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 68-year-old operations research analyst who has worked in the same \npositon since January 2019 and has worked in the same filed for at least a decade before \nthat. He has attained a master\u2019s degree in his field. Applicant honorably served in the \nmilitary for 21 years. He has maintained a security clearance for an impressive period, \nnearly 47 years. Presently single with a grown, relatively independent child, he has a net \nmonthly remainder of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nDespite the many whole person factors that speak in Applicant\u2019s favor as a reliable, \ndutiful, and earnest man, the fallout from his ex-wife\u2019s restaurant failure still reverberates \nin relation to his finances and taxes. Moreover, his documentation is less than complete \nand much of his action exerted to address the factors at issue were not commenced until \nthis past year, with one delinquent debt neglected until the week of the hearing. More \nwork is needed to fully address the allegations raised and the related financial issues. \nBecause of these deficiencies, it cannot be concluded that financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nArthur E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly all of the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. and 1.f., and 1.g.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.c. and 3.d.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a help-desk technician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and part-time positions (exchange administrator, cyber watch officer, construction security assistant, package handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician, patient transporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008 high school graduate. He enlisted in the US. Navy Reserve in November 2014, and served on active duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman (E-3), and transferred to the Inactive Reserve. He is currently in the same military status. He was granted a security clearance in 2014, but because of issues discussed further below, that clearance was suspended in November 2017, reinstated in July 2018, and again suspended in April 2019. The most recent suspension is the basis for this security clearance eligibility review. He was married in 2017. He has three children, born i",

On an unspecified date, an \nunidentified office within the Department of Defense issued him a set of interrogatories to \nverify the accuracy of an investigator\u2019s summary of an interview. He responded to those \ninterrogatories on February 27, 2020. On May 12, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \nOn an unspecified date, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The administrative record is \nsilent until December 15, 2020, when his attorney entered a Notice of Representation and \nnoted that Applicant had previously erroneously indicated a waiver of a hearing, and now \nhe was requesting a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 20, 2020. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 14, 2021. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February \n5, 2021, scheduling the hearing for February 18, 2021. Upon the request of Applicant, the \nhearing was postponed and continued. On February 26, 2021, a new Notice of Hearing \nwas issued. I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 15, 2021. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 11, and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through AE J were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 29, 2021. The record closed on \nMarch 15, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly \nall of the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. and \n1.f., and 1.g.) and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.c. and 3.d.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nhis comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings \nof fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a help-desk technician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and \npart-time positions (exchange administrator, cyber watch officer, construction security \nassistant, package handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician, \npatient transporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008 \nhigh school graduate. He enlisted in the US. Navy Reserve in November 2014, and \nserved on active duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman \n(E-3), and transferred to the Inactive Reserve. He is currently in the same military status. \nHe was granted a security clearance in 2014, but because of issues discussed further \nbelow, that clearance was suspended in November 2017, reinstated in July 2018, and \nagain suspended in April 2019. The most recent suspension is the basis for this security \nclearance eligibility review. He was married in 2017. He has three children, born in 2012, \n2014, and 2015, as well as one stepchild, born in 2010. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his period of active duty, Applicant received the National Defense Service \nMedal and the Navy Marksman Ribbon for pistol and rifle. (AE I) \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nApplicant is involved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the \nmother of one of his children, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and \nnegative interaction that resulted in Applicant\u2019s repeated engagements with law \nenforcement authorities and the court system. The SOR alleged seven different incidents \nof criminal conduct, which also were alleged separately under personal conduct. Five of \nthe incidents, and possibly six of them, because Applicant could not recall one particular \nincident, consisted of interactions involving the same participants during 2016 \u2013 2019 \nassociated with a custody dispute over their child: Applicant, and the mother of the \nparticular child, who repeatedly brought charges against him, essentially for variations of \ndomestic violence, including assault, child abuse, and trespassing; and the eventual \nresolution of the various criminal charges, with the charges associated with the six \nincidents dismissed nolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. The seventh incident was \nunrelated to the others, and it referred to an incident involving Applicant\u2019s operation of a \nmotor vehicle while intoxicated, with additional charges, during Mardi Gras, for which he \nwas convicted. \nBecause the child\u2019s mother continued to interfere with, if not actually prohibit, \nApplicant\u2019s attempts to see his daughter, in 2015, he filed for custody. (Tr. at 25-26) At \nthat point, the situation turned from interference with his visitation rights to increased \nhostility involving repeated accusations and criminal complaints against him. The \nincidents and their eventual results are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to an incident that actually took place in January 2016, not June \n2016, as alleged in the SOR, when Applicant went to the residence of his child and her \nmother to exercise his child visitation rights. A verbal dispute took place when the mother \nrefused to allow Applicant to leave the residence with their daughter. Applicant initially \nrefused to answer any questions regarding the incident, and did not leave the residence \nwhen asked to do so. Eventually, he did slowly leave the building, but stopped \nperiodically. He was arrested, handcuffed, and transported to the police station for \nprocessing. He was charged with (1) failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order; and \n(2) trespass on private property, both misdemeanors. In July 2016, all charges were \ndismissed nolle prosequi because the State Attorney acknowledged that there was a \ncustody agreement in place. (GE 2, at 7-8; GE 3, at 3-4; GE 7, at 1-4, 31-32; AE D, at 10)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to an incident that actually took place in June 2016, not January \n2016, as alleged in the SOR, when Applicant went to the residence of his child and her \nmother to exercise his child visitation rights. A verbal dispute turned physical when the \nmother refused to allow Applicant to leave the residence with their daughter. The mother, \ndesignated the \u201cvictim\u201d by the police, told the responding police officers that when she \ntried to stop Applicant from leaving with their daughter, he started strangling her with both \n3 \n\n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhands around her neck for \u201cabout 3 minutes.\u201d As he attempted to depart, the victim started \npulling on his shirt, but he pushed her down. One arresting officer initially noted a slight \nredness on the victim\u2019s neck, but after taking photos of the neck, the redness was no \nlonger observable. Another arresting officer noted scratch marks on Applicant\u2019s neck. \nApplicant denied attempting to strangle the woman. Applicant was charged with (1) \nassault in the 2nd degree; (2) failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order; and (3) \ntrespass on private property, all misdemeanors. A handgun in his car was turned over to \nthe police at the time of the arrest, but it was later returned to him. (GE 7) In July 2016, \nall charges were dismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 2, at 8; GE 3, at 4; GE 7, at 1-2, 5-26, 28-\n30; AE D, at 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in August 2016. No facts \nregarding the circumstances of the incident were submitted by either party, and Applicant \ndid not recall the event. For some unexplained reasons, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with (1) trespass on private property; (2) malicious destruction of property less \nthan $500; (3) and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors. In March 2017, all charges were \ndismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 3, at 4-5; GE 8, at 6-7; AE D, at 7-9) \nIn January 2017, an Amended Order was issued by the court ordering that \nApplicant and the child\u2019s mother shall have joint legal custody of the minor child. Among \nthe compliance requirements were that all conversations, interactions, and dealings of \nany sort between the parties shall be conducted in a civil and courteous manner; they \nshall not place the child in a stressful or traumatic situation as a result of conflict between \nthe parties; and neither party shall disparage the other party in front of the minor child. \n(AE E)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to an incident that took place on September 30, 2018. Applicant \nand his wife met with the child\u2019s mother and her boyfriend at a mall to exchange physical \ncustody of their daughter pursuant to the child custody agreement. An exchange of verbal \ncomments was followed by certain gestures, and a mutual physical assault occurred. The \ntwo women attacked each other. Both women sustained scratches on their faces, arms, \nand feet. The child\u2019s mother claimed that Applicant \u201cstrangled\u201d her, allowing his wife to \nscratch her face. In addition, she accused Applicant of holding her from behind for about \none minute, during which she could not breathe. Applicant claimed that the mother \npunched him in the face, but acknowledged trying to separate the two women. The \nresponding police officer noted small scratch marks on Applicant\u2019s arms but no noticeable \nfacial injuries. One witness acknowledged that all four individuals were involved in the \nbrawl, but did not specifically recall Applicant choking the mother.  (GE 8, at 9-18) The \nfollowing day, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) assault in the 2nd degree; and \n(2) reckless endangerment, both misdemeanors. In January 2019, all charges were \ndismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 2, at 9-10, 16; GE 3, at 5-6; GE 6; AE D, at 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to an incident that took place in January 2019. At the time of the \nincident, the child was temporarily residing in Applicant\u2019s residence during a week of \ncustody. When she returned from school one particular Thursday, he noticed that she \nwas acting strangely because she had received a referral at school for striking another \nchild and not listening at school. He disciplined her with two smacks on her bottom with \n4 \n \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na cloth belt and sent her to bed early. He claimed that he did not bruise her. When the \nchild eventually returned to her mother on the following Monday, the mother found her to \nbe oddly quiet. The mother noticed a bruise on the child\u2019s thigh and wrist. She called the \npolice. The authorities called Child Protective Services, and the child was placed in her \nmother\u2019s emergency protective custody. Shortly thereafter, upon learning that there was \na warrant for his arrest, he turned himself into the authorities. They charged him with (1) \nchild abuse in the 2nd  degree \u2013 custody; (2) child abuse in the 2nd  degree \u2013 house; (3) \nassault in the 2nd  degree; and (4) reckless endangerment, the first two charges being \nfelonies, and the remaining charges both misdemeanors. Charges (1) and (2) were \nmerged into charge (2), and charges (3) and (4) were merged into charge (3)(GE 2, at 9; \nGE 3, at 5-6; GE 5, at 2-7) In June 2019, both charges were \u201cclosed\u201d when a Stet notice \nwas issued, placing them on an inactive docket and forgotten by the state. Applicant was \nrequired at attend anger management, to be completed within six months, and to avoid \nunlawful contact with the minor child. (GE 11; GE 5, at 12-16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a series of alleged violations that took place over an \nunspecified period that eventually resulted in Applicant\u2019s arrest in March 2019. He was \ncharged with seven violations, all of which were misdemeanors, such as violation of \nconditional release, violation of release, violation of release conditions, and failure to obey \ncourt order. All of the charges were associated with the criminal charges, already \ndiscussed above, for which those charges were dismissed nolle prosequi or placed on \nthe Stet docket. All of these charges were placed on the Stet docket in June 2019. (GE \n3, at 6-7; GE 4) \nAlthough it was not alleged in the SOR, there was another incident between the \nsame two protagonists that took place in August 2020 during another custody exchange. \nApplicant reportedly removed his daughter\u2019s watch and placed it on the hood of the \nmother\u2019s automobile, purportedly scratching the car. The mother got out of the car to \nreturn the watch to their daughter, but as she attempted to hand it to the child, Applicant \nrolled up the window and started to drive away, almost running over the mother\u2019s foot. \nShe managed to return the watch, but Applicant took it and threw it out the window. \nApplicant disputed her allegations and claimed she came over to his car and kicked it, \nand then she reached inside the window and hit him in the face. (Tr. at 31) After the \nmother reported the incident to the police, Applicant was eventually arrested and charged \nwith (1) malicious destruction of property less than $1,000. (GE 10) The matter has not \nyet been resolved. (GE 9) \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-\n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged criminal conduct will be \nconsidered only for the five purposes listed above. \nApplicant is remorseful about the situation with the mother of his child, and his sole \ndesire is to maintain a healthy and loving relationship with the child. Because of the \nrepeated situation, he requested and obtained mutual protective orders and has altered \nthe location of the child custody exchanges away from the mother\u2019s residence, initially \nrequesting that they take place at the police barracks. (GE 2, at 10) In addition, he has \nattempted to limit conversations to email. He now seeks alternative ways to discipline his \ndaughter when discipline is necessary. In October 2018, he successfully completed a 6-\nhour Co-Parenting/Divorce Class (AE F), and he routinely participates in family, as well \nas, class activities with his daughter. (AE C; AE H) \nAs noted above, there is also one incident that is vastly different from the ones \ninvolving the mother of his child. SOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to an incident that occurred during \nMardi Gras in February 2017, when Applicant got behind the wheel of his automobile after \nconsuming too much beer and becoming intoxicated. He was stopped by the police and \nadministered a breathalyzer. The reading was 0.98. He was arrested by the police and \ncharged with (1) operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI); (2) operating a vehicle with \na suspended license; and (3) procedure on approach of an authorized emergency vehicle \n(similar to failure to yield the right of way), all misdemeanors. He was ordered to perform \n40 hours of community service and fined $900. (GE 3, at 2; GE 2, at 9; AE A) \nAdditional Personal Conduct \nIn addition to the joint criminal conduct and personal conduct issues described \nabove, the SOR also alleged three incidents of personal conduct, not criminal conduct, \nwhich raised additional security clearance issues associated with his failure or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, thus questioning his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Those incidents \nand their eventual results are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 2.d. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in June 2016 when he \nwas terminated from the city public charter school for failure to meet performance \nstandards. He was initially hired in August 2013 as a substitute teacher and intern in a \nspecific health-care program managing approximately 40 students over three classes of \ndiffering content. When a certified teacher was hired for that position, Applicant was \nmoved into another internship with the health and physical education teacher in the \nmiddle grades. At the end of his first year at the school, his supervisor, the school principal \nretired. During the second year, Applicant was a health teacher, but his mentor was a \nmath teacher. Teaching on his own, he struggled because he was in over his head and \nneeded help, but it was apparently not given to him. At the end of the year, the new \nprincipal informed him that the health program was no longer to be offered and the \nteaching position was going to be abolished. Applicant was given referrals to other \nschools looking for health teachers. Applicant admitted that he was placed on a \nperformance improvement plan (PIP), but otherwise denied ever being told that his \nperformance was substandard. The following year, rather than securing another teaching \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition, he chose to seek different employment elsewhere. (GE 2, at 12-13; AE B, at 4; \nAnswer to the SOR, at 1, 3) Other than the fact that Applicant initially admitted the \nallegation, there is no other evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s other descriptions of his \nrelationship with the school system or how or why that relationship ended. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. refers to an incident that took place in January 2017 when he was \nterminated from his employment with a multinational technology company, where he had \nbeen working in package direction, for falling asleep while on shift. At the time, he had \nbeen working at multiple jobs, and on this one occasion he fell asleep while on break \nworking the night shift. He was called into the office and fired. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he had placed himself in a position where he had taken on more than he should have, \nand he pledged not to put himself in another similar situation in the future. (GE 2, at 6; \nAnswer to the SOR, at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in December 2017 when \nhe was terminated from his employment with a corporation that was sponsoring him for a \nsecurity clearance after it had previously been suspended. He was in the process of \ncompleting a new SF 86 and assumed that the information appearing in his original SF \n86 would be sufficient. However, because of new developments, the new SF 86 was \nincomplete. By the time the entire security clearance eligibility process was completed \nand his security clearance was reinstated, the employer no longer had the position \navailable for him. He denied that he was terminated. (GE 2, at 6; Answer to the SOR, at \n3; Tr. at 33) There is no evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s description of his relationship \nwith the employer or how or why that relationship ended. \nCharacter References and Work Performance \nApplicant\u2019s first city charter-school supervisor and principal, and a veteran, noted \nthat Applicant connected with the students in a way that many new teachers can\u2019t, which \ncontributed to his success while assigned to his position. Applicant was considered a \ndefinite asset to the school program. His \u201ccan-do attitude for any task assigned, his \nwillingness to go the extra mile, and his ability to develop relationships with all students \nand adults he came into contact with was a trait necessary to be successful in any course \nof work. . . .\u201d (AE B, at 4) \nApplicant\u2019s uncle, an ophthalmologist and a veteran, described Applicant in \nglowing terms: he maintained a 3.0 grade point average while he played football, \n\u201cdemonstrating versatility and a multifocal approach toward achievement\u201d; he was a \nvolunteer tutor for elementary, middle, and high school students; he honed critical skills \nin the health profession while working in the emergency room at the shock trauma center \nat a large medical center; he became a certified educator in the state; and he has a \nconstant will to overcome obstacles. (AE B, at 3) \nA lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps has known Applicant his entire life. \nHe noted that Applicant leaned on his faith and family members to persevere and endure \n\u201cthe fiery trials that came to him.\u201d He \u201cwithstood the pressures that crush most young men \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nof his age, but he thrived . . . .\u201d He added that Applicant is \u201ca driven and talented young \nman with outstanding moral character.\u201d (AE B, at 1-2) \nThe president and chief executive officer of the state university medical center \ncongratulated Applicant for completing ten years of service toward the commitment to \nimprove the health of people in the community. (AE J; AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s two most recent U.S. Naval Reserve Evaluation Report and Counseling \nRecords reflect that he is a vital member of the unit who displays the ability for increased \nresponsibilities. He is a solid and proven performer who produces quality work and \napproaches each endeavor with a positive attitude and without complaint, in a timely \nmanner ensuring his dependability. He has unlimited growth potential, and he should be \npromoted early. He either meets or is above the reported performance traits. (AE G) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAs noted above, during the three year period from 2016 through 2019, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged on seven different occasions for a variety of incidents, with all \nbut one of those incidents involving alleged violent behavior with the same woman \u2013 the \nmother of one of his children \u2013 who, since he was able to obtain joint custody of their \ndaughter in 2015, reported him to police and lodged the complaints that led to his arrests. \nAll of the six arrests eventually resulted in all charges being dismissed nolle prosequi or \nplaced on the Stet calendar. The one other incident, in 2017, was isolated and unrelated \nto the others, as it was for several driving violations, including DWI, for which he was fined \nand ordered to perform community service. Based on those seven incidents described \nabove, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32 (c), and 32(d) fully or partially apply. As noted above, Applicant is \ninvolved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the mother of one of his \nchildren, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and negative interaction \nthat resulted in Applicant\u2019s being repeatedly engaged with law enforcement authorities \nand the court system. On each occasion, the woman\u2019s version of the events \u2013 the sole \nsource of the information presented to the police \u2013 was accepted by the arresting police \nofficers, even when there was little or no independent evidence that her versions were \ntruthful. It is especially noteworthy that she reported that Applicant had attempted to \nstrangle her with both hands around her neck \u201cfor three minutes\u201d on one occasion when \nthere were no other witnesses, and that he tried to strangle her again on another occasion \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen there were witnesses who refuted her accusations.  Applicant disputed much of \nwhat she had described, and he steadfastly denied the allegations both to the \nprosecutorial authorities and the judges before whom he appeared. With few exceptions, \nhis explanations have gone unrebutted. Several of the charges, especially those related \nto child abuse, assault, reckless endangerment, and malicious destruction of property, \nwere investigated by the prosecuting authorities or the Child Family Services, and those \ncriminal charges were dismissed. Examining the rather sketchy and incomplete damaging \ndocumentary evidence submitted against him, and the substantial number of dismissals, \nleads to a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s explanations are essentially true.  \nThe lone independent criminal charges \u2013 the ones associated with his 2017 DWI \nduring Mardi Gras \u2013 occurred four years ago, and such conduct was not repeated. He \nacknowledged that his actions were foolish, and he has modified both his alcohol \nconsumption and driving after consuming alcohol. Considering the period of time since \nthat incident, it appears that it is unlikely to recur. He has been described as \u201ca driven and \ntalented young man with outstanding moral character,\u201d and he is dependable. His positive \nactivities with youth as well as his substantial volunteer work in the healthcare system \nseem to be at odds with the characteristics described by the woman who shares their \nchild\u2019s physical custody with him. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, and \nin this instance the most recent alleged criminal conduct \u2013 which had also been closed \u2013 \nis two years ago. With the expectation that other criminal complaints will probably be filed \nagainst him by the same woman, there are, nevertheless, no realistic concerns about \nfuture criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s past history of alleged criminal conduct, under the \ncircumstances, no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. In addition \nto the criminal conduct allegations discussed above, Applicant was allegedly involved in \nthree incidents or situations that brought into question his personal conduct: being \nterminated from employment. There is a scarcity of evidence presented by the \nGovernment, and aside from Applicant\u2019s comments, all of the evidence presented is from \nhim, and there is no independent evidence from the employers that support the \nallegations. Applicant denied having been terminated from one employer and contended, \nwithout rebuttal, that he was not terminated, but that once his security clearance was \nreinstated, there was no longer a position open for him. While he acknowledged being on \na PIP, he denied being terminated from the charter school and contended that he was \nrecommended for a school position at other schools. Other than the fact that Applicant \ninitially admitted the allegation, there is no other evidence to contradict or rebut \nApplicant\u2019s other descriptions of his relationship with the school system or how or why \nthat relationship ended. He was admittedly terminated from another position when he fell \nasleep during the night shift during a period when he was working multiple jobs. There is \nno evidence to rebut his comments regarding that situation. As to the allegations \nregarding the alleged personal conduct, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.c., AG \u00b6 16(c) \nhas been established. However, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 2.d., AG \u00b6 16(c) has not \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(e) apply. My comments associated with the criminal \nconduct section also apply in an assessment of personal conduct concerns. Applicant \nhas taken various steps to insulate himself from the ire of his child\u2019s mother; modify his \ndriving habits after consuming alcohol; and taken a more realistic approach to life without \nextending himself beyond his capabilities to avoid situations such as the one where he \nfell asleep on the job while holding multiple jobs. Those who know him attest to his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and outstanding performance. It is highly unlikely that \nApplicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct, especially that which was associated with his \ncriminal conduct, will recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the \nvarious aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not \nmerely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. \n1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nApplicant was involved in seven different incidents of criminal conduct, which also \nwere alleged separately under personal conduct. Five, and possibly six, of those incidents \nconsisted of interactions involving the same participants during 2016 \u2013 2019 associated \nwith a custody dispute over their child: Applicant, and the mother of the particular child, \nwho repeatedly brought charges against him, essentially for variations of domestic \nviolence, including assault, child abuse, and trespassing; and the eventual resolution of \nthe various criminal charges, with the charges associated with the six incidents dismissed \nnolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. The seventh incident was unrelated to the others, \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand it referred to an incident involving Applicant\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle while \nintoxicated, with additional charges, during Mardi Gras, for which he was convicted. He \nwas also fired by one employer because he fell asleep while on the job. While he was \ngranted a security clearance in 2014, that clearance was suspended in November 2017, \nreinstated in July 2018, and again suspended in April 2019. \nThe mitigating evidence is simply more substantial and compelling. Applicant is a \n31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a help-desk \ntechnician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and part-time \npositions (exchange administrator, cyber watch officer, construction security assistant, \npackage handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician, patient \ntransporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008 high \nschool graduate. He enlisted in the US. Navy Reserve in November 2014, and served on \nactive duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman (E-3), and \ntransferred to the Inactive Reserve. He is currently in the same military status. His military \nperformance reported that he is a solid and proven performer who produces quality work \nand approaches each endeavor with a positive attitude and without complaint, in a timely \nmanner ensuring his dependability. One character reference, a U.S. Navy chaplain, \ncharacterized him as \u201ca driven and talented young man with outstanding moral character.\u201d \nApplicant is involved in an extremely volatile and hostile relationship with the \nmother of one of his children, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and \nnegative interaction that resulted in his being repeatedly engaged with law enforcement \nauthorities and the court system. He was involved in seven different incidents of criminal \nconduct, which also were alleged separately under personal conduct. Six of the incidents, \nassociated with a custody dispute over their child, were initiated when the child\u2019s mother \nrepeatedly brought charges against him. All of the charges were eventually dismissed \nnolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. Applicant disputed much of what she had \ndescribed, and he steadfastly denied the allegations both to the prosecutorial authorities \nand the judges before whom he appeared. With few exceptions, his explanations have \ngone unrebutted. Several of the charges, especially those related to child abuse, assault, \nreckless endangerment, and malicious destruction of property, were investigated by the \nprosecuting authorities, or the Child Family Services, and those criminal charges were \ndismissed. While falling asleep while working during a period when he had multiple jobs \nis unacceptable in the workplace, and a poor performance in doing one\u2019s job in the \nworkplace may also be unacceptable, neither activity comes anywhere close to an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 47 years old, and married to his third wife. She has two children, ZS and NS. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as an insider threat analyst and is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 45-47.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in sexual behavior that reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject Applicant to undue influence or coercion. 1.a. Applicant denied this allegation, which concerned his alleged inappropriate conduct with his minor stepdaughter, EM, from 2012 to 2014. Applicant served in the Air Force for 24 years, retiring in 2017 with the rank of master sergeant (E-7). He was a member of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) for the majority of his career, including when these alleged incidents happened. (Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, F, G, and H; Tr. 47-48.) Applicant was married to his second wife, RL, from March 2013 to May 2015. Her daughter is EM. She has two other children, AC and LC. All three of the children lived with Applicant and RL during the time of their marriage. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 17.) On June 10, 2015, RL reported to the local police authorities that EM had been sexually assaulted. This original report concerned people other than the Applicant, and oc",

(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 45-47.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he engaged in sexual behavior that reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject \nApplicant to undue influence or coercion. \n \n1.a. Applicant denied this allegation, which concerned his alleged inappropriate \nconduct with his minor stepdaughter, EM, from 2012 to 2014.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant served in the Air Force for 24 years, retiring in 2017 with the rank of \nmaster sergeant (E-7). He was a member of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations \n(AFOSI) for the majority of his career, including when these alleged incidents happened. \n(Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, F, G, and H; Tr. 47-48.) \nApplicant was married to his second wife, RL, from March 2013 to May 2015. Her \ndaughter is EM. She has two other children, AC and LC. All three of the children lived \nwith Applicant and RL during the time of their marriage. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section \n17.) \nOn June 10, 2015, RL reported to the local police authorities that EM had been \nsexually assaulted. This original report concerned people other than the Applicant, and \noccurred at a time after Applicant and RL were divorced. (Applicant Exhibit R.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nEM was subsequently interviewed at a child advocacy center on June 11, 2015. \nDuring the interview she first discussed the sexual assault that had recently occurred to \nher. She then went on to discuss the Applicant. The report stated in part: \n \n \n[EM] reported that her ex step-dad [sic], [Applicant], sexually abused her in \n2014. She stated that he touched her when her mom was out of town for \nwork. [EM] reported that it happened more than one time. She stated that \n[Applicant] would rub on her thighs and try to \u201cfinger\u201d her. [EM] reported that \n[Applicant] would rub her genitalia on the inside and outside of her pants. \n[EM] reported that one time they were watching a movie when [Applicant] \nput his hand in her pants. She stated that [Applicant] inserted his fingers on \nthe inside of her vagina. [EM] reported that [Applicant] pulled his pants \ndown, showed her his penis and asked her to touch it. She stated that she \ntold him \u201cno\u201d. . . . She indicated that there was another time where \n[Applicant] digitally penetrated her anally and vaginally. [EM] reported that \n[Applicant] looked at her, told her that he should not have done that and not \nto tell her mom. . . . [EM] reported that some of the incidents happened on \nthe couch in the living room. She stated that her siblings would be in their \nbedrooms. She stated that she told her mom and [AM]. [EM] reported that \n[Applicant] would act inappropriately around her and [AM]. She stated that \n[Applicant] would \u201csmack\u201d her and [AM]\u2019s buttocks randomly. . . . She stated \nthat he touched her on the inside of her pants when she would sleep in the \nbed with him. [EM] reported that [Applicant] told her he made a mistake and \nnot to tell her mom. She stated that she still told her mom. [EM] reported \nthat [Applicant] and her mom convinced her that it was a dream and that it \ndid not actually happen. She stated that the last time anything happened \nwas while her mom was in the hospital which was around her mom\u2019s \nbirthday. [EM] reported that her mom\u2019s birthday is October 12th  2014. \n(Applicant Exhibit R at 21-24.) \n \nThe police forwarded the case to the county prosecuting attorney\u2019s office. That \noffice declined to prosecute the case due to \u201cinability to sustain a conviction.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit Q.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubsequent to the declination of prosecution the local police turned the case over \nto the AFOSI for their investigation. Applicant had been temporarily assigned to the \nInspector General\u2019s office during the pendency of the investigation. AFOSI began their \ninvestigation on September 17, 2015. AFOSI re-interviewed RL, which basically \nconfirmed what EM had told the local authorities. AFOSI did not re-interview EM. \n(Applicant Exhibit N.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAFOSI interviewed AM, a step niece of Applicant. She was 17 at the time of the \nalleged acts. The report stated: \nAn interview of VICTIM [AM] disclosed that she moved in with the [Applicant \nand RL] before her senior year in High School (2014), and lived with them \nfor about a year. One day (NFI; VICTIM [AM] could not recall the date), \nVICTIM [EM] came to her in tears and told her [Applicant] touched her \ninappropriately on the couch in the living room. VICTIM [EM] said [Applicant] \nwas touching her stomach and eventually touched her \u201cboobs.\u201d VICTIM \n[EM] told her [Applicant] would go into VICTIM [EM]\u2019s room at night when \nher mother was working and touch her when she pretended to be asleep. \nVICTIM [EM] told [RL] who convinced her it was just bad dreams. VICTIM \n[AM] described she felt uncomfortable around [Applicant], and he \ninappropriately smacked her buttocks. (Applicant Exhibit N at 5-6, 11-12.) \nEM also confided in another girl, ES. ES was also interviewed by AFOSI. The \ninterview was reported as follows: \n[ES] stated that VICTIM [EM] visited her residence after being released from \nthe hospital. . . . VICTIM [EM] stated she wanted to speak with ES. VICTIM \n[EM] started tearing up and told [ES] that when she lived at the first \nresidence, [Applicant] touched her legs, her buttocks, and gave \u201cweird\u201d hugs \nthat she did not like on several occasions. VICTIM [EM] then demonstrated \nhow [Applicant] touched her thigh and \u201cslapped her butt.\u201d (Agent Note: \nDuring this portion of the interview, [ES] placed her right hand in the area \nbetween her right hip and knee indicating where VICTIM [EM] stated \n[Applicant] touched her.) \n[ES] told her mother what VICTIM [EM] shared with her and as a result, \n[ES]\u2019s mother told [RL]. A few days later, [ES] and VICTIM [EM] talked about \nthe incident again. VICTIM [EM] asked [ES] if she told [RL] about what she \nshared with her and [ES] said that she told her mother due to the severity \nof the incident. [ES] then asked VICTIM [EM] if the incident really happened. \nVICTIM [EM] stated, \u201cYeah, but no, because I didn\u2019t want anyone else to \nknow.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit N at 16-17.) \nIt is noted that AM stated during the investigation that she did not believe EM about \nApplicant because EM has been untruthful in the past. The mother of ES also stated that \nshe did not believe RL or EM because, \u201cthey did not know the difference between the \ntruth and a lie.\u201d Evidence was introduced that RL had made unfounded sexual misconduct \nallegations against another former husband. (Applicant Exhibit N at 11-12, and 17, Exhibit \nV; Tr. 78.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant called two witnesses during his case. In addition to providing positive \nrecommendations regarding Applicant, further discussed below, the reputation of RL and \nEM for truth and veracity was also discussed. \nOne of the witnesses is a serving deputy sheriff in the county where the alleged \nincidents took place. He is a retired AFOSI agent and has known Applicant, RL and EM. \nHe had a very negative view of the veracity of RL and EM. The witness considers \nApplicant a close friend. (Tr. 20-31.) \n \nThe second witness is a former Air Force non-commissioned officer in the medical \nfield. She is also a friend of Applicant\u2019s. Applicant lived in her house for a year after his \ndivorce from RL. The witness does not believe the allegations made by EM against \nApplicant. She believes Applicant to be trustworthy and someone that she has trusted \nwith her children. (Tr. 31-43.)  \n \nAfter the AFOSI investigation the Air Force preferred charges against Applicant \nunder Article 120(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The specifications \nunder the charge consisted of two counts of Sexual Assault of a Child, and two counts of \nSexual Abuse of a Child. They were all connected to Applicant\u2019s conduct with EM. \n \nPursuant to the UCMJ an Article 32 hearing was held before a senior Judge \nAdvocate officer. EM did not testify at the hearing. However, she did provide a written \nstatement dated January 24, 2017. That statement was sealed by the Hearing Officer and \nis not a part of this record. However, the Hearing Officer did discuss the contents of this \nstatement in his \u201cPreliminary Hearing Officer\u2019s Report\u201d dated February 6, 2017, as \nfollows: \nAs to the first \u2013 in her mother\u2019s bed \u2013 she [EM] stated that she was 10 years \nold and it happened at the family home . . . (before the families moved in \ntogether). . . . She recalls waking up with the Accused [Applicant] \u201crubbing \nmy vagina on the skin with his hand.\u201d . . . She pretended to be asleep, the \nAccused eventually stopped, and the next day everyone seemed normal. . \n. . \nShe further explained that the \u201clotion\u201d incident occurred right after the family \nhad moved into their first home . . . She said that she complained about her \nsore tailbone, that the Accused told her to lay on her stomach on the couch \nand take off her underwear (she was just wearing a large t-shirt), and he \nthen took baby oil and starting [sic] rubbing her: \u201cHe was rubbing my back \nand then my butt. And then he inserted his fingers inside my vagina and \nanus. He would insert one whole finger and then transition to multiple \nfingers at a time, up to four fingers at one point.\u201d . . . She repeated that he \nadmitted to this sexual assault and asked her not to tell. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to the incident on the couch, EM stated: \nWhile we were living in the first house . . . , we were sitting on the \ncouch watching TV. He was rubbing my thigh (as he often did) for a \nlong time. He was wearing a blue underarmour short [sic] and black \nbasketball shorts and depending on how he was sitting on the couch, \nI could see his private parts. While we were sitting on the couch, he \nbegan to rub my vagina on the skin, and then he reached into his \npants and took out his hard penis from the top of his basketball \nshorts. He told me if I was ever curious or if I wanted to see and \nunderstand or something to that affect [sic]. He then grabbed my \nhand and tried to get me to touch his penis, but I pulled back and \ntensed up and then he let me [sic] hand go. I then got up and went \nto the bathroom and then went to bed. \n.\n.\n.\n. \nEM discussed a couple of other incidents of touching after this, and reported \nthat the last occasion was when she was 13 years old and her mother was \nin the hospital. (Applicant Exhibit O.) \n \nAs stated, the Hearing Officer prepared a report. In addition to the discussion \nabove, the report basically reiterated the facts as set forth in this decision. The Hearing \nOfficer found, \u201cThere is probable cause to believe that the Charge and each Specification \nhas been committed . . . . And there is probable cause to believe that Accused [Applicant] \ncommitted the offenses.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit O.) \nDespite his factual findings the Hearing Officer recommended that the charges be \ndismissed. He stated: \nOn the evidence before me, there is no reasonably [sic] possibility of \nsuccess on the merits. In the \u201cbest\u201d of circumstances, child sexual \nassault/sexual abuse cases are notoriously hard to prove beyond a \nreasonable doubt. There are numerous circumstances here that will make \nit even more difficult. Though not uncommon not to have third-party \nwitnesses to such offenses, here neither EM\u2019s mother, younger brother, \nyounger sister, or [sic] adult household resident [AM] will provide any \nsubstantive information to corroborate EM\u2019s allegations. Thus, proof beyond \na reasonable doubt will hang on EM\u2019s credibility. The Government will have \na difficult time establishing that as the Defense will likely subject EM to a \ndevastating cross-examination. \n,\n,\n,\n, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis analysis is not whether the offenses did or did not occur or whether EM \nis or is not telling what she believes to be the truth about. This analysis is \nsimply an experienced and objective overview of the difficulty of proving \nthese allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. Moving forward with trial with \nno reasonable likelihood of success it [sic] not fair to either the victim or the \nAccused. Here, there is no reasonably [sic] possibility of success on the \nmerits. Thus, I recommend the Charge and Specifications be \ndismissed. (Emphasis in original.) (Applicant Exhibit O.) \nThe Staff Judge Advocate of a major Air Force command recommended to the \ngeneral court-martial convening authority that the charges be dismissed without referral \nto a court-martial. His reasoning generally tracks with that of the Hearing Officer. Based \non that recommendation the court-martial convening authority, an Air Force lieutenant \ngeneral, dismissed the charges and specifications on April 4, 2017. (Applicant Exhibit P.) \nApplicant subsequently received a letter of reprimand from the commander of \nAFOSI on May 11, 2017. Its terms basically follow all the allegations discussed in the \nSOR. On June 29, 2017, Applicant was permanently disqualified from being an AFOSI \nagent. Applicant requested retirement, which was granted with an effective date of July \n1, 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at Exhibit O, and Exhibit 6; Tr. 79-80.) \nLater in 2017 Applicant was provided an administrative due process hearing by the \nDepartment of Children and Family Services in the state where he lived. After a hearing \nthe administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the department failed to show by a \npreponderance of the evidence that a specific incident regarding EM occurred, \nspecifically, \u201cSexual Penetration as to [EM].\u201d The ALJ recommended that the record be \nexpunged as to that allegation and one other, further described below. The particular facts \nof the allegation concerning EM are not set forth in the ALJ decision. (Applicant Exhibit \nT; Tr. 91-92.) \nApplicant was extensively questioned by his counsel, cross-examined by \nDepartment Counsel, and also questioned by me. He absolutely denied that any \ninappropriate sexual activity happened between him and EM. (Tr. 50-59, 78-81, 84-96.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part this allegation, which alleged that \nin 2014 he sexually harassed his minor step-niece, AM, by smacking her on the buttocks. \nApplicant admitted that he engaged in such conduct. He testified that \u201cthere was a \nsmack on the bottom, but it wasn\u2019t anything sexual in nature. It was, I guess, a love tap, \nif you will, kind of like an attaboy with baseball.\u201d During the period this happened AM was \n17 and lived with Applicant and RL. (Tr. 59-63.) \nDuring the investigation of Applicant described in detail above AM was interviewed \nby AFOSI. The report of that interview stated, \u201cVICTIM [AM] described she felt \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuncomfortable around [Applicant], and he inappropriately smacked her buttocks.\u201d \n(Applicant Exhibit N at 5-6, 11-12.) \nAM provided a signed statement to Applicant\u2019s attorney dated January 26, 2021. \nShe stated, \u201cI am writing this email to confirm that [Applicant] did not sexually harass me. \nI believe it was just simply a misunderstanding. He has never done anything to me to \nmake me think that he did or would sexually harass me.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit U.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part this allegation, which stated that \nhe \u201csent a sexually suggestive message to A.S., an eighteen-year-old family friend. You \nwere married at the time.\u201d \n \n \nAccording to Applicant he saw an attractive picture of AS on the internet. He \nresponded with the comment, \u201cSooooo, you almost got me with the bewitching pic. As \nsoon as I saw it my thought was you can ride my broomstick anytime! Then, I realized \nwho you were [frowny face] stop growing up so fast. [whistling face]\u201d AS replied, \u201cXD I\u2019ll \ntry.\u201d According to Applicant this occurred in January 2015 and he was separated from his \nwife at that time. (Applicant Exhibit Q; Tr. 63-66.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n2.a. The Government alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant\u2019s alleged sexual \nmisconduct, as set forth above, was also cognizable under this guideline. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. \n2.b. The Government alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant falsified \ninformation regarding other alleged acts of sexual misconduct in interrogatories \npropounded to him by DOHA and signed by him on June 10, 2020. Specifically, Applicant \nis alleged to have falsified Section 2, Item 2 of the interrogatories, which asked him \nwhether \u201c[o]ther than the allegations made against you by your minor stepdaughter [E.M.] \nin about October 2014, have you EVER been accused of child sexual abuse by ANY \nperson at ANY time.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Applicant denied this allegation stating he \nforgot about these particular allegations due to the age of them. (Government Exhibit 3; \nTr. 67-70.) \nThis allegation has three subparts: \n2.b.i. In this subpart it is alleged that Applicant lied by not stating that he was \naccused in March 8, 2012, of abusing his minor stepdaughter, AC, by her biological father. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated this allegation was false and was instigated by AC\u2019s biological \nfather. He also stated that the allegation was unfounded, which is supported by the ALJ \ndecision in Government Exhibit 3 at Exhibit T. In addition, Applicant submitted a guardian \nad litem report from 2012 about this particular allegation, supporting the fact that it was \nunfounded. (Applicant Exhibit V; Tr. 69-72.) \n2.b.ii. The Government alleged in this subpart that Applicant failed to admit that in \nDecember 2015 his minor stepdaughter, AC, told her mother that he had \u201ctickled her \npeepee.\u201d Applicant denied this allegation, stating that it was actually made against the \nchild\u2019s birth father. Therefore, there was no need to report it since this allegation did not \ninvolve Applicant. (Tr. 72-74.) \n2.b.iii. The Government alleged in this subpart that Applicant failed to disclose that \nhe was the subject of at least five hotline complaints regarding the three children of RL \u2013 \nEM, AC, and LC; also the children of his cohabitant (now his third wife) NS and ZS. \nApplicant\u2019s interrogatory responses include the AFOSI report (Government Exhibit 3 at \nExhibit L), and the ALJ decision (Government Exhibit 3 at Exhibit T). Both documents \ndiscuss these allegations and discount them. (Tr. 74-77.) \nAttached to the interrogatory response (Government Exhibit 3) is Exhibit T, the \n2017 decision of the DCFS ALJ also discussed above. In addition to the allegation \nregarding EM the ALJ also adjudicated an allegation of \u201cSubstantial Risk of Sexual Injury \nas to [AC], [LC], [ZS], and [NS].\u201d Once again he found that the department had not proved \ntheir case using the preponderance of the evidence standard, and recommended that the \nreport be expunged. \nMitigation \nAs stated, two witnesses testified for Applicant. In addition to their testimony about \nthe factual allegations in this case they also discussed the Applicant as a person. Both \nwitnesses describe him as a friend who they trust in important matters in their own \npersonal lives. They recommend him for a position of trust. \n \nApplicant supplied positive letters from Air Force personnel who worked with him \nin the Inspector General\u2019s office after the allegations set forth in this case surfaced. The \nwriters stated that Applicant was a very good non-commissioned officer who helped the \nInspector General\u2019s office in many ways. With knowledge of the allegations against him \nthe writers recommend him for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibit F.) \nApplicant provided documentary evidence about his Air Force career.

In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for sexual behavior are set out in \nAG \u00b6 12, which reads in pertinent part: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case under \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n1.a Applicant was investigated for sexual abuse of his minor stepdaughter, EM. \nApplicant was eventually referred for court-martial. The case was eventually dismissed \ndue to evidentiary concerns. Applicant received a letter of reprimand and retired. All of \nthe above disqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case as set forth in allegation \n1.a. \n1.b. Applicant did spank his minor step-niece, AM, by slapping her on the buttocks. \nAt the time she indicated that the conduct was inappropriate. Now she states that he did \nnot mean to sexually harass her and she did not take it that way. Since she is the \ncomplaining witness, and has repudiated her earlier statement, I find there is insufficient \nevidence to support this allegation. It is found for Applicant. \n1.c. Applicant did send an email to an 18-year-old woman that could be interpreted \nas sexual in nature. Applicant was separated from his wife, RL, at the time the email was \nsent. The recipient was an adult. While arguably crass, given that the recipient was an \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadult at the time, there is no security significance in this act, and this allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \nThe following mitigating conditions have been considered in this case under AG \u00b6 \n14: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant has consistently argued that he did not engage in criminal sexual activity \nwith EM. He submits that the decision not to try Applicant in state court or by court-martial, \nevidence of RL\u2019s history of making false accusations, evidentiary issues with EM\u2019s \nreputation for veracity, and the findings of the state DCFS ALJ support his innocence. I \ndisagree. \nIn considering the allegations against Applicant by EM we start with one primary \nfact \u2013 that his alleged conduct was not her primary purpose for going to the police. In fact, \nher mother took EM to the police to report a later act of sexual assault against EM by \nother people. It was during that investigation she revealed the facts of Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct. In other words, the predicate for the investigation was not the alleged \nconduct by Applicant. \nWe also look at the facts as described by EM four separate times. She described \nthe conduct of Applicant to her relative, AM. She also described it to a friend, ES. She \nwas interviewed by a clinical social worker. Finally, she submitted a written statement to \nthe Hearing Officer. She described Applicant\u2019s conduct in great detail. While there were, \nadmittedly, some details that were inconsistent between the statements, the basic facts \nremain consistent. Applicant argues that RL, given her reputation for making false \naccusations, might have prompted EM to make a false report about Applicant to the \npolice. That does not explain EM\u2019s disclosures to the two girls. I have considered all of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments and find them wanting. \nThe decisions of other tribunals have been viewed and considered by me, but are \nnot controlling. Based on the state of the record, I find that Applicant did engage in criminal \nsexual acts with his minor stepdaughter, EM.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are applicable under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with his minor stepdaughter. \nThe Government also alleges that Applicant falsified his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories. All of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are applicable under \u00b6 17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged that behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct with his stepdaughter, as set forth above, shows extremely \npoor judgment. Applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for it means it cannot be \nmitigated either as a minor incident, or due to the passage of time. Neither of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Allegation 2.a is found against Applicant. \nApplicant is also alleged in allegation 2.b to have falsified his interrogatory \nresponses when he said that he had not been accused of other acts of child sexual abuse. \nThis answer was false in the response document. However, Applicant incorporated \nvoluminous documentary correspondence with his response, which is considered to be \npart of it. That documentation contained all of the information about the allegations he is \nalleged to have concealed. Accordingly, the Government was put on notice of all of the \nallegations that made up this paragraph in the SOR. Since Applicant submitted all the \ndocumentation voluntarily, I find that there was no intent to deceive on his part. \nAccordingly, none of the Disqualifying Conditions apply to allegation 2.b and it is found \nfor Applicant. However, based on the finding concerning allegation 2.a, this paragraph is \nfound against Applicant. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his misconduct with his stepdaughter, EM. Overall, the record \nevidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility, and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility.

In response to an inquiry concerning \nwhether he had illegally used any drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, \nApplicant reported that he started using marijuana as a teenager in approximately August \n2012 \u201cto cope with a strict home life/school stress and it became habit.\u201d He gave a date of \nJuly 2018 for his most recent marijuana use and related that he used marijuana \n\u201crecreationally and as a de-stresser. Smoked on weekends during high school, ramped up \nto every day after entering university for about four straight years.\u201d Applicant responded \nnegatively to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future, and gave the following \nexplanation: \n1 The FORM bears a date of \u201cJuly 29, 2020,\u201d but a transmittal letter dated July 1, 2020. Applicant signed the \ntransmittal receipt on July 16, 2020. The FORM was likely submitted on June 29, 2020. On September 23, \n2020, I contacted Applicant to confirm his receipt of the FORM. He indicated that he received the FORM and \ndid not to file a response. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI mainly smoked marijuana to deal with the excessive stress my education \nput on me. Since graduating college three months ago, my life became \nsignificantly easier to manage. I stopped feeling the urge to smoke, allowing \nme to quit cold turkey recently. Additionally, I have grown as a person since I \nwas 16 and found healthier ways of working through my personal issues. \n(Item 4.) \nApplicant also disclosed on his SF 86 that he used the hallucinogenic drugs LSD \nand mushrooms between March 2015 and May 2018, to the following extent: \nInitially taken purely out of curiosity. I tripped a few more times because I \nfound it quite enjoyable. These were few and far between, sometimes going \nas long as 10 months without use. 1 month was the smallest time frame \nbetween uses. My combined number of uses of [the drugs] totals 12, 10 LSD \nand 2 mushrooms. \nApplicant denied any intention to use hallucinogenic drugs in the future because of their \naffects on his brain and body. He related that his mood was adversely affected for several \ndays after his most recent use, which he took as a warning that he \u201ccould permanently \ndamages his psyche.\u201d In response to an SF 86 inquiry into whether he had intentionally \nengaged in the misuse of prescription drugs in the last seven years, Applicant reported that \nhe used Adderall twice as a study aid between August 2015 and April 2016. (Item 4.) \n \nOn April 1, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about his drug involvement, \nApplicant volunteered that he last used marijuana in January 2019. He explained that he \nused marijuana recreationally and as a sleep aid, outside, in his college dormitory, and at \nhis current residence. He used marijuana with five friends, whom he named. He \nacknowledged that he continues \u201cto correspond with them.\u201d He related that he obtained his \nmarijuana from \u201cvarious random individuals.\u201d Applicant indicated that he felt dependent on \nmarijuana, but he denied any adverse affects from the drug other than that his marijuana \nuse caused some strain in his relationship with his father and some decline in his grades. \nApplicant related that he used LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms in his college dormitory \nwith four of the same friends with whom he used marijuana. As for his limited Adderall use \nas a study aid in college, he obtained it from someone with whom he is no longer in \ncontact. Applicant denied any intent to use illegal drugs or misuse a prescription drug in the \nfuture but also then admitted that he could possibly use marijuana again. On June 5, 2019, \nthe OPM investigator interviewed Applicant by telephone. Applicant admitted that he \ncontinues to associate with the five friends involved in and knowledgeable about his \nmarijuana use. (Item 5.)   \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories inquiring about his illegal drug involvement, \nApplicant indicated on February 24, 2020, that he used marijuana as recently as February \n14, 2020. He explained that his use of marijuana varied from months of no involvement to \nmonths of daily use. He denied any intent to use marijuana in the future \u201cunless \ncircumstances change or it becomes legal nationwide.\u201d Applicant reported no use of LSD or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhallucinogenic mushrooms since May 2018 and no use of non-prescribed Adderall since \nApril 2016. He denied any intent of future use of any of the drugs. (Item 6.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nDespite some states\u2019 legalization or decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana \nfor recreational use, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 812. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have no currently \naccepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of \nthe drug under medical supervision. Applicant began using marijuana in August 2012, the \nsummer before his junior year in high school. He continued to use marijuana on weekends \nin high school. While in college from August 2014 to May 2018, he used marijuana \u201cup to \nevery day after entering [the] university for about four straight years.\u201d He also used LSD ten \ntimes and hallucinogenic mushrooms twice between March 2015 and May 2018, and \nAdderall not prescribed for him twice between August 2015 and April 2016. Applicant has \nabstained from hallucinogenic drugs and Adderall since he graduated from college, but he \ncontinued to use marijuana on occasion to as recently as February 14, 2020. Disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d clearly applies. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia,\u201d Applicant obtained the drugs that he used from others. It is unclear whether \nhe purchased or contributed funds for any of the drugs that he used. While Applicant had \nphysical possession of the drugs that he used when he used them, illegal possession was \nnot alleged as a separate disqualifier. AG \u00b6 25(c) is not implicated.  \nAG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d warrants \nconsideration. When Applicant applied for a security clearance in September 2018, he \nstated that he had been able to quit using marijuana \u201ccold turkey\u201d after a recent use in July \n2018, and that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Yet, as he volunteered \nduring his April 1, 2019 interview, he last used marijuana in January 2019. During his \ninterview, he stated that he might use marijuana in the future, and the evidence shows that \nhe used marijuana as recently as February 14, 2020. He now intends to forego any future \nmarijuana use \u201cunless circumstances change or it becomes legal nationwide.\u201d His candid \ndisclosure about his drug involvement on his SF 86, during his subject interview, and in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories allow me to accept as credible his February 2020 \nintention to forego any future marijuana use unless circumstances change, such as if \nmarijuana use is legalized nationwide. Even so, he has clearly shown an inability to abide \nby this intent to abstain. His failure to convincingly demonstrate a commitment to abstain \nfrom marijuana establishes AG \u00b6 25(g). \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply, and given \nthe extent and recency of his drug involvement and substance misuse, he bears a heavy \nburden. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nan individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nApplicant\u2019s use of hallucinogenic mushrooms went beyond experimentation, but it \nwas limited to the college environment. His abuse of non-prescribed Adderall occurred \ntwice during his sophomore year in college, and so it can reasonably be considered \ninfrequent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply in mitigation of his Adderall use, and AG \u00b6 26(b) \napplies in mitigation of his use of hallucinogenic drugs. \nHowever, none of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana became \u201ca habit\u201d for him in college. He continued to use \nmarijuana after graduating from college and leaving the dorm environment. The change in \nhis environment brought some decrease in the frequency of his involvement, but it did not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nbring about a cessation of his use. He continues to associate with friends involved in his \nrecreational use. Applicant has also used marijuana as a sleep aid. He used marijuana \nafter he submitted his SF 86 and was interviewed for his security clearance, which casts \nserious doubts about whether he can be counted on to comply with federal laws and DOD \npolicies and regulations concerning the possession and use of illegal drugs. Perhaps most \nconcerning, he has shown an inability to abide by his promises to the DOD that he will \nabstain from marijuana. Although his candor about his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse weighs in his favor, it does not immunize him from the negative security implications \nof his extensive marijuana involvement. The risk of Applicant using marijuana in the future \ncannot be ruled out. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are not \nfully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions, and Applicant\u2019s candor about his drug involvement weighs in his favor. Yet, \nit is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). The Government must be \nable to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to fulfill their \nresponsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard to their \npersonal interests. Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use raises enough doubt in that regard \nto where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must be considered before \ndeciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. \nAlthough, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n4 \n   The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.

AG \u00b6 18. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special \ninterest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Other concerns are raised in connection with Applicant\u2019s 2018 \ndomestic violence charge. \nFinancial concerns \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nDC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d both apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create  \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23, 2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with his delinquent debt accumulations raise \nconsiderable concerns over his ability to manage his finances in a responsible and \nreliable way. \nExtenuating circumstances appear to have played some role in Applicant\u2019s debt \naccumulations following his spousal separation in 2018. With so little financial \ninformation to work with on the state of his finances since his marital separation, no \nmeaningful extenuation credit can be assigned based on his marital separation claims \nalone. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of his financial conditions and \nexplanations of his lack of payment progress on his delinquent debts, Applicant \nprovided no persuasive clarifications or explanations for (a) why he allowed his \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccounts to become delinquent, and (b) why he has failed to take any documented \nsteps to address his delinquent accounts. For lack of any documented repayment or \nfinancial counseling initiatives by Applicant, other potentially available mitigating \nconditions cannot be applied to Applicant\u2019s situation. Based on his failure to date to \nestablish a meaningful track record of addressing his account deficiencies, it is too soon \nto make safe predictive assessments as to whether Applicant can restore his finances \nto stable levels consistent with minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nAdditional security concerns are raised in connection with Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated domestic violence incident in February 2018. Based on a thorough review of the \ndeveloped evidence in the record, one pertinent disqualifying condition (DCs) is \napplicable to the facts of Applicant\u2019s situation. DC \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information \nin several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder any other guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation,\u201d applies. \nApplicant has since reconciled with his wife (although they remain separated) \nand learned to curtail his drinking and avoid intoxicated encounters with his spouse in \ntheir interactions. He has avoided any recurrent incidents, does not socialize or work \nwith persons who are involved in criminal activity, and assured that he will never engage \nin any recurrent conduct of the nature that resulted in his domestic violence guilty plea \nin 2018. One mitigating condition (MCs) applies to Applicant\u2019 situation: MC \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his accrued delinquent debts and his failure to sufficiently \naddress them heretofore are otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his contributions to the \ndefense industry, his employment contributions are not enough at this time to overcome \nhis accumulated delinquent debts and his lack of a meaningful track record for dealing \nwith them. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that, while personal conduct \nconcerns are mitigated, financial considerations concerns are not mitigated.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 29, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated, and in it he elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on January 7, \n2021. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.

I \nreopened the record on March 22, 2021, to permit Applicant an opportunity to submit \nupdated information. On April 1, 2021, he submitted an email and three documents. They \nare marked as Appellant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4 and admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He is a high school graduate. He took some college \ncourses, but did not earn a degree. He served in the Marine Corps from July 2001 to \nSeptember 2005 and was honorably discharged. He is not married and has no children. \n(Item 3) \nOn his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that \nhe was a student from September 2005 to January 2008 and again from March 2010 to \nJune 2010. He disclosed that he was employed from January 2008 to March 2008; \nunemployed March 2008 to June 2008; employed June 2008 to September 2008; \nunemployed September 2008 to March 2010; employed March 2010 to September 2016; \nunemployed September 2016 to April 2017; and employed April 2017 to June 2017. He \nbegan his current job working for a federal contractor in July 2017. (Items 3, 7) \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent student loans totaling approximately $26,099, and \na delinquent medical debt in the approximate amount of $1,001. During Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2019 background interview with a government investigator, he explained that \nthe student loans were for a school that he attended that later closed. According to his \ncredit reports, he received the loans in 2006 through 2008. He said he did not pay the \nloans because he was not earning enough. He applied for a student loan forgiveness \nprogram. He told the investigator he had not received any information on his application. \nHe did not provide evidence to show what actions he may have taken regarding the loans \nwhile he was working or if he made any contact with the creditor to request a forbearance. \nHe stated that in January 2019, his wages were garnished to pay his student loan debt. \nIn his submissions, he stated that he was advised that he did not qualify for the loan \nforgiveness program. He provided pay stubs to show in January 2019 his wages were \ngarnished to repay the student loans. In 2020, the garnishment was paused due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The garnishment resumed in 2021. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7: AE 1, 2, \n3, 4) \nDuring his background interview, Applicant denied the medical debt alleged in the \nSOR, believing his medical expenses were covered by his veteran\u2019s benefits. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he admitted the debt. He did not provide any information about the \nstatus of this debt, nor did he mention its status in his submissions. All of the debts alleged \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; AE \n1) \nApplicant told the investigator that he is capable of meeting his financial obligations \nand intends to resolve his debts immediately. He attributed his financial problems to \nunemployment and underemployment. (Item 7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has six delinquent student loans and a delinquent medical debt that \nbegan accumulating in approximately 2010. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. He secured student loans to attend college from 2005 to 2008, and \n2010. He failed to pay the loans. He indicated the school where he attended went out of \nbusiness. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in January 2019 to pay the student loans. \nSubsequently, Applicant applied to have the loans forgiven. He was advised his loans did \nnot qualify for the forgiveness program. Applicant did not provide evidence of any \nvoluntary actions he may have taken prior to his wages being garnished to pay the \ndelinquent loans or actions he may have taken when he was employed from 2010 to 2016 \nor when he began his most recent employment in July 2017. His unemployment and \nunderemployment was beyond his control. Applicant did not provide evidence of any \naction on his part to contact the holder of the loans before garnishment commenced to \nbegin payments. I find Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) partially applies. \nGarnishment is not considered a good-faith effort to repay a debt. There is no \nevidence Applicant has received financial counseling nor did he submit information about \nhis current finances. Applicant failed to provide any evidence of his actions to dispute or \nresolve the delinquent medical debt. I find none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent student loans that he failed to address until his \nwages were garnished. He failed to provide evidence of any attempt to resolve his medical \ndebt. Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Item 2.) \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on May 2 and 3, 2019.

Applicant\u2019s mother lived in the apartment with one of his \nbrothers and Applicant intended to continue owning the apartment until his mother \npassed away so that she had a place to live. In Applicant Exhibit A he updated the \ninformation to state that his mother has left his brother\u2019s home and is now living with \nApplicant\u2019s sister. Applicant stated, \u201cI asked my brother to move out from my house \nbecause taking care of my mother was our deal and was broken by them [Applicant\u2019s \nbrother and his wife]. I informed him that I intended to sell my house and he needed to \nmove out.\u201d Applicant has stated that once the house is sold he will transfer the money to \nthe United States and use it for a down payment on a home here. (Item 4, Applicant \nExhibit A.) \nApplicant also stated to the investigator that he had an Iranian passport and \nintended to renew it so that he could travel to Iran to see his mother. He also needed an \nIranian passport in order to own and transfer property. Applicant also updated this \ninformation in his response to the FORM. He stated: \nI returned my Iranian passport to the Interests Section of I.R. [Islamic \nRepublic] of Iran (Embassy of Pakistan \u2013 Washington D.C.) because I \nintended to renounce my Iranian citizenship. Per their officials, this \nprocess might take 2 years or even more that is expected from an \nabnormal regime. They were supposed to send me confirmation letter but \nthey have not yet. Currently, I have no document except the post office \nreceipt. Hopefully, I would have enough time to sell my house and transfer \nthe money. (Item 3 at Section 10, Item 4; Applicant Exhibit A.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is also a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant obtained \nlawful permanent resident status for her and she moved to the United States at one \npoint. However, she subsequently returned to Iran and currently lives there. (Item 4.) \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. Applicant did not supply any \ninformation as to his financial situation here in the United States.

The U.S. Department of State advises \nAmerican citizens not to visit Iran due to the very high risk of kidnapping, arrest and \ndetention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans. Iran has \nbeen designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. Iran continues to present a \ncyber-espionage and attack threat. The Iranian government\u2019s human-rights record is \nextremely poor. There are numerous reports of unlawful killings, forced disappearances, \nand torture. (Request for Administrative Notice: Attachments.) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence) \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to Foreign Influence is set forth in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject an \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, four brothers, and mother-in-law all reside in Iran. He \nhas frequent contact with his mother and regular contact with his siblings. He owns a \nhouse in Iran valued at approximately $50,000. All three of the disqualifying conditions \napply to the facts in Applicant\u2019s case, thereby transferring the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate the concerns. \nIran has a government that operates contrary to U.S. interests. Iran\u2019s \ngovernment is a state sponsor of terrorism, and engages in significant human rights \nabuses. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country have the potential to \ngenerate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The DOHA Appeal Board has said that the mere \npossession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to \ncreate the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise \nof classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n6 \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant has close family connections in Iran. As stated, he speaks to his \nmother on a weekly basis, and his siblings fairly regularly. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not \napply to the facts of this case. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he has begun to make essential moves to make himself \nless vulnerable to coercion or pressure. Applicant\u2019s decision to revoke his Iranian \ncitizenship and return his Iranian passport is noted. It is also noted that Applicant has \nworked for several years for a defense contractor without a blemish on his record. \nHowever, there is little additional information in the file concerning Applicant\u2019s life that \nwould support a finding of \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties to the \nUnited States.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b) applies minimally to the facts of this case. \nApplicant has decided to sell his house in Iran. That will be an important fact \nonce the sale has been completed. However, there is no evidence in the record \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s financial situation in the United States that would allow \ncomparison with his financial interests in Iran. Without such evidence, I cannot find that \nAG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \n \nThe available evidence precludes a finding in Applicant\u2019s favor at this time. \nGuideline B is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s current relationship and \ncontacts with his family in Iran, as set forth above, make him ineligible for a position of \npublic trust at this time. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is \nsubstantial. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns under the whole-person concept. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. National security eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He followed his attorney\u2019s advice and did \nnot resolve his debts until the court divided their assets and liabilities and ordered that \nhe was responsible for the three debts owed to the credit union. He was also on short-\nterm disability after an accident in 2019. (Tr. at 16, 19-21, 24-25, 31; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE E, M) \n \n \nApplicant settled the charged-off auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for $5,364, with the final \npayment of $1,964 made in February or early March 2021. The SOR alleges the \namount owed was $18,840. That amount apparently came from the December 2018 \ncombined credit report. TransUnion and Experian reported that $18,840 was charged \noff, but the balance was reported as $15,327. Equifax reported that $15,327 was \ncharged off, with a balance of the same amount. I conclude that $15,327 was owed on \nthe account before it was settled. Applicant settled the $14,330 charged-off auto loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) for $2,866, which he paid in December 2020. He paid $2,190 in December \n2020 to settle the $10,953 charged-off credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. at 15-\n17; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6, 8; AE A-C) \n \n \nApplicant paid, settled, brought current, or otherwise resolved the remaining \nthree SOR debts, which totaled about $3,641. His finances are otherwise stable. He has \na good job with an annual salary of $135,000. He also receives disability pay from the \nVA. (Tr. at 17-23, 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5, 6, 8; AE D, M) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant made three deployments to Afghanistan between 2007 and 2011. He \nsubmitted letters attesting to his excellent performance of duties in the military and his \nstrong moral character. He is praised for his dedication, professionalism, \ntrustworthiness, and integrity. He was arrested in 2014 and charged with driving under \nthe influence and a weapons charge. He pleaded guilty to the DUI charge pursuant to a \ndeferred adjudication, and the weapons charge was dismissed. (Tr. at 14, 29-32; GE \n10; AE F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including six delinquent consumer \ndebts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to reduced earnings after his \ndischarge, a protracted divorce, and an accident that resulted in him going on short-\nterm disability. He followed his attorney\u2019s advice and did not resolve his debts until the \ncourt determined who was responsible for the debts.  \n \n \nAll of the SOR debts have been settled, paid, or otherwise resolved. Applicant\u2019s \nfinances are otherwise stable. He has a good job with an annual salary of $135,000, \nand he receives disability pay from the VA. \n \n \nApplicant had a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence, years of honorable military service, and also his 2014 \narrest and subsequent conviction.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

On \nApril 22, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H.

The \ncase was assigned to me on October 15, 2020. On December 10, 2020, DOHA issued \na notice scheduling the hearing for January 5, 2021. On December 14, 2020, I issued a \nCase Management Order to the parties by e-mail. It largely concerned procedural \nmatters relating to the health and safety of the hearing participants due to the COVID-19 \npandemic.

(Tr. 62-64) \nIn 2015, Applicant began experiencing immense joint pain and difficulty walking. \nIn December 2015, she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She testified that \nthe condition was sufficiently painful and debilitating that she was unable to work for a \nperiod of time. She began pursuing treatment options, and was prescribed prednisone \nand methotrexate, a cancer drug with significant side effects. (Tr. 35-37, 44, 49-51; GE \n2; AE C) \nApplicant lives in a state that has a medical marijuana program. In April 2017, \nfollowing consultation with her physicians, she applied for and received approval in her \nhome state to use medical marijuana. (Tr. 30-31, 44-45; AE C; AE E)) \nApplicant provided documentation from her physician confirming her condition \nand the fact that it was \u201camenable to treatment with medical cannabis\u201d under her home \nstate\u2019s regulations. The documentation states, however, that \u201c[t]his is not a prescription.\u201d \n(AE F) Applicant also provided her medical marijuana Patient ID card, issued by her \nstate\u2019s medical cannabis regulatory agency. (AE F) \nAdditional documentation from Applicant\u2019s medical cannabis treatment facility \nnoted that she has been compliant with state laws regarding the use of medical \ncannabis for her condition. The letter acknowledged, however, that \u201c[a]lthough [State] \nrecognizes the recommendation of medical cannabis for various conditions, our \ncompany does understand that this is still not recognized by Federal agencies.\u201d (AE E) \nApplicant began using marijuana for medical purposes in December 2017. By \nthat time, she was unemployed and was not actively sponsored for a clearance. (Tr. 55-\n59, 61-62) She reported her medical marijuana use (from December 2017 to March \n2018) on her March 2018 SCA. She noted that she was an \u201capproved medical cannabis \nuser\u201d in her home state. She said she used marijuana \u201cas needed for [a] medical \ncondition: oral tincture and pills mostly, and/or dried flower.\u201d She noted that she \nintended to use the drug in the future, and explained \u201cI am currently trying to wean off \nprescription cancer medication and cannabis is helping me do this.\u201d (GE 1 at 38; Tr. 45-\n46) \nAt the time of her August 2018 background interview, Applicant typically used \nmedical marijuana two to five times a week, always after work or on weekends. She \nacknowledged using marijuana while possessing at least an interim security clearance. \n(GE 2 at 2-3) \nIn February 2020, before the SOR was issued, a DOHA Department Counsel \n(DC) e-mailed Applicant about her case. The DC noted that Applicant had \nacknowledged in her interview summary that she used marijuana pursuant to a valid \nmedical prescription in her home state. He noted further that \u201cwhile some states have \nlegalized marijuana, possessing marijuana remains illegal under Federal law.

(GE 3 at 2) \nApplicant responded and elected the latter option, though her response was \nsilent as to her future intentions as to marijuana use. (GE 3 at 2) The SOR was issued \nin April 2020. During her testimony, Applicant acknowledged the e-mail exchange, and \nconfirmed her response, and her awareness of the negative impact on her clearance \napplication. (Tr. 74) \nAt her hearing, Applicant testified that she now uses medical marijuana about \none to three times a week, typically on the weekends. She used medical marijuana as \nthe weekend before the hearing. She confirmed a future intention to continue doing so. \n(Tr. 76-78) (\u201cI will continue to use medical cannabis for medical purposes, and weaning \noff of methotrexate,\u201d while continuing to pursue other RA medications.

(Tr. 54) She takes care not to drive under the influence of marijuana. (Tr. \n34-35, 54, 60-61) She gets the marijuana from a legal dispensary, and does not grow or \ndistribute it herself. (Tr. 72, 78-79) She confirmed that she uses marijuana or cannabis, \nbeyond cannabidiol (CBD). (Tr. 75-76) \nApplicant testified that she considers treatment options for her RA other than \nmedical marijuana \u201call the time.\u201d (Tr. 59-60) She remains under the care of her \nphysicians, including a lead physician at a pain-management practice, and a \nrheumatologist. They are aware of her medical marijuana use, and see no evidence of \nsubstance abuse. (AE C; AE E) Applicant testified that she uses medical marijuana \nunder their consultation. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant testified that she uses the medical \ncannabis \u201cjust like I would any other prescribed medication,\u201d for pain relief. (Tr. 31) \nApplicant testified further that her RA is chronic, and worsening. She remains on \npainkillers that allow her to walk and function. (Tr. 36-37) \nApplicant was assessed for substance abuse by a drug counseling center, and \ndid not fit the criteria for a diagnosis, though the center did recommend counseling.

(Tr. 79) \nShe testified that she is aware of state laws in her home state and does not violate \nthem. Applicant acknowledged that she was \u201cvery well versed\u201d with the fact that \nmarijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under Federal law. Recognizing \nthe \u201ccontradictory nature\u201d of state and Federal law, Applicant nevertheless asserted a \ndesire to \u201cbe up front and transparent and navigate this to the best that I can without \nencroaching on my principles and how I want to manage my own health. And it is a very \ndifficult place for me to be in.\u201d (Tr. 73; Tr. 76) \nApplicant testified that she believes she is regarded at work as reliable, \ntrustworthy, experienced, and knowledgeable. There has been no negative impact on \nher work performance or quality, her integrity or her ethics. She believes she provides \nan important service to her government customer and the important work that they do. \nShe understands the importance of confidentiality and integrity and is proud and \nprivileged to contribute to the defense community. (Tr. 32, 380-39; AE C) \nApplicant provided strong recommendation letters from several references. (AE \nD) Mr. N is a retired project manager both as a cleared contractor and employee of a \nU.S. government agency. He is familiar with the SOR and the issues in the case. He \nhas known Applicant since 2007 when they worked together for two years on a large \nproject. He also served as a career mentor. Mr. N attested that Applicant made a \nsignificant contribution and was a conscientious and talented employee who he could \ncount on to perform. He attested to her sound judgment and attention to protecting \nsensitive government information. Mr. N is aware of Applicant\u2019s medical condition and \nher legal use of medical marijuana to treat it. She \u201cremains as reliable and trustworthy \nas [he] knew her to be\u201d when they worked together. (AE D) \nMr. W is a retired Army officer who currently works as a program manager for the \nArmy. He has held a clearance for many years. He is familiar with the SOR and the \nissues in the case. He was a supervisor and co-worker of Applicant\u2019s from 2000 to 2006 \nat a factory that manufactured frozen dairy products. Applicant was involved in quality \ncontrol, inventory, and shipping. Mr. W and his team \u201cplaced great trust in her ability to \ndocument, maintain, and manage proprietary information.\u201d She has excellent judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and responsibility. Mr W is aware of Applicant\u2019s medical condition and \nher legal use of medical marijuana to treat it, and he believes her worthy of holding a \nclearance while under proper medical care. (AE D) \nMr. S and Ms. F are lifelong friends of Applicant\u2019s. Their families know each other \nwell. Both are familiar with the SOR and the issues in the case. Applicant is a caring \nand supportive mother to her three children. She is also a consummate professional. \nShe is focused and detail-oriented. She is trustworthy and \u201cunimpeachably honest.\u201d Her \nintegrity and honesty are \u201cbeyond reproach,\u201d and they both highly recommends that she \nbe granted a clearance.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment, \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nAt the end of the hearing, I took administrative notice of a memorandum issued \nby the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in October 2014 (DNI Memorandum, \n\u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d (HE V) and asked the parties to \nbrief its applicability to the facts of the case. I have read and considered their positions, \nset forth in their closing arguments and their post-hearing briefs.  \n \nThe DNI Memorandum makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to \nmarijuana by the various states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the \nexisting National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that federal law supersedes \nstate laws on this issue: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe Appeal Board has cited the 2014 DNI memo in holding that \u201cstate laws \nallowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do not pre-empt \nprovisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not \nbound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that \nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016).  \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2007, though it was likely inactive \nduring her periods of unemployment. Since December 2015, Applicant has used \nmarijuana for medicinal purposes to help alleviate the pain from her chronic medical \ncondition. She has done so under medical supervision, as a legal participant in her \nstate\u2019s medical-marijuana program. She has used medical marijuana on a regular basis, \nusually on weekends, since she resumed working as a cleared employee with a \ndefense contractor in March 2018, and as recently as the weekend before the hearing. \nShe indicated an intent to continue doing so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(f), and 25(g) therefore \napply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is recent and ongoing, and she intends to continue \nusing marijuana for medicinal purposes as treatment of her chronic medical condition. \nThe fact that her use is legal under her state\u2019s law, and the fact that she is fully \ncompliant with the requirements of that program, is not mitigating when her involvement \nwith marijuana continues to violate federal law. As such, her ongoing use of medical \nmarijuana continues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment, at least with respect to her suitability for a DOD security clearance. AG \u00b6 \n25(a) therefore does not apply. Given Applicant\u2019s stated intentions of continued use of \nmarijuana in the future, AG \u00b6 25(b) also does not apply. \nBond Amendment \nGiven the facts of the case, I also asked the parties to brief the issue of \napplicability of Appendix B of SEAD 4 (Bond Amendment Guidance). I have read and \nconsidered their positions. \nAppendix B reflects language in the Bond Amendment to the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2008, as amended (IRTPA), which prohibits granting or \nrenewing a \u201csecurity clearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of a \ncontrolled substance or an addict ...\u201d. (SEAD 4, App. B, para. 1) In citing this prohibition, \nthe DNI memorandum notes that \u201cunder Federal law, use of marijuana remains \nunlawful.\u201d (DNI Memo at 2) \nThus, regardless of whether Applicant\u2019s use of medicinal marijuana is legal under \nher state\u2019s law (under a prescription or otherwise), it is not legal under Federal law, and \nthe Bond Amendment applies. I am therefore prohibited from granting Applicant a \nclearance as long as her marijuana use remains current and ongoing. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, and the record evidence, including Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and other statements, as well as Applicant\u2019s strong whole-person evidence \nfrom her work references. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my \nwhole-person analysis. \nApplicant presents as an intelligent, thoughtful individual who is caught on the \nhorns of a dilemma. She has a debilitating, chronic medical condition, and she has \nchosen to relieve her suffering through medical marijuana, administered, with \nappropriate oversight from her physicians, under her lawful state\u2019s medical marijuana \nprogram. This is the only issue with her clearance suitability, as she otherwise presents \nas an appropriate, even excellent, candidate for continued eligibility. Her problem is that \nshe seeks a security clearance (and renewal of it) by the U.S. Department of Defense, \nand marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under Federal law. Even \nthough her marijuana use, for purely medical purposes, is legal under her home state\u2019s \nlaw, I therefore cannot find that Applicant has met her burden of showing that she has \nfully mitigated the security concerns set forth by her ongoing use of medical marijuana, \nand her declared intention to continue such use in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for continued access \nto classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, five of his eight siblings, and his in-laws are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. None of his immediate family members or in-laws are currently \nassociated with or employed by the Iraqi government. The potential for terrorist and \nother violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and Iraq \ncontinues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05\u00ad\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist in support of the U.S. \nmission from 2005 to 2007, which earned him a special immigrant visa. He hopes to \nreturn to Iraq in support of the U.S. military. I give this experience significant weight. I \nfind that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of \nthe United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him a special immigrant \nvisa. His goal is to obtain a security clearance to once again serve the United States. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the \nUnited States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant in a \nGuideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). The \ncomplicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his family members in Iraq do not pose an unacceptable \nsecurity risk. He has met that burden. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $35,707 for six delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). In response, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c. He denied with explanations SOR 1.d \u2013 1.f. (FORM, Items 1 and 2). His admissions establish the SOR allegations as facts. As to his denials, Department Counsel noted that Applicant provided explanations with his responses but no documentation. To be clear, Applicant\u2019s denials framed the allegations in SOR 1.d \u2013 1.f as controverted issues of fact. Accordingly, it became the Government\u2019s responsibility to present sufficient information to prove those allegations. (Directive, E3.1.14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked as an installer since February 2018. Between October 2004 and November 2016, he worked in similar positions for other defense contractors. He was unemployed for nine months in 2016 and 2017 after a previous employer lost its federal contract. All of Applicant\u2019s work since 2004 has been performed overseas in the same country.

After reviewing the \ncompleted background investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified \ninformation, as required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive \n5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOn May 15, 2020, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations).

In response, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c. \nHe denied with explanations SOR 1.d \u2013 1.f. (FORM, Items 1 and 2). His admissions \nestablish the SOR allegations as facts. As to his denials, Department Counsel noted that \nApplicant provided explanations with his responses but no documentation. To be clear, \nApplicant\u2019s denials framed the allegations in SOR 1.d \u2013 1.f as controverted issues of fact. \nAccordingly, it became the Government\u2019s responsibility to present sufficient information \nto prove those allegations. (Directive, E3.1.14) In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked as an installer since February 2018. Between October 2004 and November 2016, \nhe worked in similar positions for other defense contractors. He was unemployed for nine \nmonths in 2016 and 2017 after a previous employer lost its federal contract. All of \nApplicant\u2019s work since 2004 has been performed overseas in the same country. Applicant \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Navy between June 1995 and August 2004. He has held \na security clearance since at least December 2006. (FORM, Items 3 and 7) \n2 \n \nApplicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he had incurred a delinquent credit card debt \nfor $8,000, and \n \n that he had paid off that debt in January 2014. He also disclosed that he \nhad missed one mortgage payment in January 2015, and that had also resolved that past-\ndue debt. During the ensuing background investigation, government investigators \nobtained a credit report in August 2017 that documented the debts listed at SOR 1.a and \n1.f. As to the latter, the report showed Applicant was past-due for $4,227 on an account \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbalance in July 2017 of $11,679. On July 5, 2019, Applicant completed a subject interview \n(SI) with a government investigator during which he discussed those debts. Applicant \ndenied the SOR 1.a debt was his, suggesting that it actually was his father\u2019s debt. \nApplicant acknowledged the SOR 1.f account was his, but he could not provide details \nabout the origin or history of the debt. He acknowledged during the interview that his \nspending habits likely contributed to this delinquency. He also stated that he planned to \nhave all of his debt resolved by the end of 2019. A credit report obtained by DOD \nadjudicators in November 2019 reflects the debts addressed at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.e, but makes \nno mention of the debts at SOR 1.a or 1.f. All of the delinquent or past-due debts \ndocumented by the Government\u2019s information were accrued between 2015 and 2017. \n(FORM, Items 3, 6, and 7) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant now acknowledges that SOR 1.a is his \nresponsibility, claiming it is a debt he incurred because he lost track of it as he moved \u201cto \ndifferent locations.\u201d He further asserted that he and the creditor agreed to settle the debt \nfor half of the total owed, which was to be paid by \u201cMay 2021.\u201d In response to the FORM, \nApplicant claimed this debt is being paid down; however, he did not support this claim \nwith any payment receipts or other documentation. (FORM, Items 2, 5, and 6; FORM \nResponse) \nAs to SOR 1.b, in response to the SOR, Applicant claimed that this credit card debt \nwas incurred with a joint user, and that Applicant has contacted the creditor to verify the \ncharges on the card and to arrange for repayment. In response to the FORM, Applicant \nclaimed that the original $5,371 delinquency has been reduced to $2,417 and that, as of \nOctober 13, 2020, \u201c[p]ayment was being sent via regular mail and (sic) should have a \nzero balance in the next two weeks.\u201d None of this has been documented. (FORM, Items \n2, 5, and 6; FORM Response) \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, he averred the SOR 1.c debt had been \npaid off and that he was waiting for confirmation from the collection agency in possession \nof the account. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated claimed the account had a \nzero balance and that he anticipated having it removed from his credit history. The \naccount still showed as delinquent in credit reports obtained in November 2019 and \nAugust 2020. Applicant did not submit any documentation to support his claims that the \ndebt has been resolved. (FORM, Items 2, 5, and 6; FORM Response) \nApplicant denied owing $1,360 for the delinquent cell phone account alleged at \nSOR 1.d. The account still showed as delinquent in credit reports obtained in November \n2019 and August 2020. Although he disputes this debt as \u201cin error\u201d in response to the \nFORM, he indicated that he settled the matter and now has a zero balance due with that \nservice provider. Again, there is nothing in the record that supports this claim. (FORM, \nItems 2, 5, and 6; FORM Response) \nApplicant denied the alleged debt for an unpaid utility bill in SOR 1.e. He owns \nmultiple rental properties, and claims that one of his tenants was responsible for this \naccount. Applicant provided documentation showing that he paid this debt in September \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020, and stated he planned to seek reimbursement from his tenant. (FORM, Item 2; \nFORM Response) \nApplicant describes his current finances as sound and claims that he is able to \nmeet all of his regular financial obligations without difficulty. He has worked overseas for \nmost of the past 15 years and ascribes his financial problems to a combination of poor \nspending habits and his failure to keep track of his accounts caused, in part, by multiple \nrelocations. As of September 11, 2020, Applicant earned a net bi-weekly income of about \n$4,000, which equates to about $8,600 in monthly take-home pay. His paystub also \nshows he receives a bi-weekly housing allowance of $1,503, which equates to about \n$3,250 monthly. In the FORM, Department Counsel repeatedly highlighted the \nimportance of documentary support for Applicant\u2019s claims. Additionally, the deadline for \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM was extended for 30 days, yet he did not provide any \nother information about his monthly expenses or about any professional financial \ncounseling he has received. (FORM at page 3; FORM, Items 2 and 7; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that between 2015 and 2017, Applicant accrued \ndelinquent or past-due debts totaling more than $35,000. When the SOR was issued \nabout three years later, with one exception those debts remained unresolved. This \ninformation reasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 \n18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Applicant claims he has been acting to \nresolve his debts, yet he has not documented his claims. The mere absence of entries in \nhis credit report is not sufficient. Applicant had ample opportunity to submit corroborating \ninformation. His financial problems are recent, in that, with the exception of SOR 1.e, they \nare still unresolved. Although at one point he was unemployed for nine months, he did \nnot present information that shows his debts arose from circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. Further, Applicant has not acted promptly to resolve his debts. He has not sought \nprofessional financial assistance, and he did not show that his finances will not present \nsimilar concerns in the future. \nOn balance, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s information. In addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me \nin the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). My review of all of the \navailable information leaves unresolved the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus \nof these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the individual. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, from about 2005 to present, and that she continues to consume alcohol despite two diagnoses of alcohol use disorder, one qualified as moderate in 2019, and the other as mild in 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) Specifically, the SOR alleged that: in 2005, while in the Army, Applicant was reprimanded for being involved in a physical altercation where alcohol was involved (SOR \u00b6 1.g); in 2008, Applicant participated in the Army\u2019s Alcohol Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) (SOR \u00b6 1.c); in 2015, she was arrested and charged with alcohol-related misconduct (breaking and entering, receiving stolen property, criminal mischief, and theft) (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and in 2017, she was arrested and charged with alcohol-related misconduct (criminal mischief, aggravated assault, public 2 drunkenness, and disorderly conduct). It also alleged that in 2017, she was treated for alcohol abuse and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, mild (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and in 2019, she was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that: \u201cYour boyfriend, with whom you have cohabited, is a citizen of India residing in the United States.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.a, as amended); and that she continues to associate with an ex-boyfriend who is a Saudi Arabian citizen working for the Saudi embassy (SOR \u00b6 2.b).

Since then, she has \nestablished a pattern of modified, responsible alcohol consumption. Applicant has a close \nromantic relationship with an Indian citizen living in the United States. On balance, \nbecause of her service and deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in and to \nthe United States, she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. Foreign influence (Guideline B) and alcohol consumption (Guideline G) \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 11, 2017, \nseeking continuation of her clearance eligibility, required for a position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, \nthe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 9, 2020, alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline G and Guideline B.

I \ngranted the motion as requested. (Tr. 114-115) \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts concerning \nSaudi Arabia and India. In Guideline B cases, I am required to consider, among other \nthings, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its internal and external affairs, its relations \nwith the United States, and its human rights record to assess the likelihood that an \napplicant or his family members are vulnerable to pressure or coercion - to determine \nwhether foreign influence security concerns are raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to \ncitizens of other countries. Applicant did not object, and I took administrative notice as \nnoted in the decision. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the source documents and \nsummarized in Department Counsel\u2019s written request and will not be repeated verbatim \nin this decision. (GE 11) It is sufficient to note that India has engaged in technological, \neconomic, and industrial espionage against the United States. India is one of the \ncountries with the highest numbers of terrorist incidents. Human rights abuses continue \nwithout punishment for those involved. (GE 11) \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to \nthe point of intoxication, from about 2005 to present, and that she continues to consume \nalcohol despite two diagnoses of alcohol use disorder, one qualified as moderate in 2019, \nand the other as mild in 2017.

Applicant\u2019s SOR admission and those at her hearing are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant, 35, graduated from high school in 2004, and received her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2014. She enlisted in the U.S. Army after high school and honorably served \nuntil November 2008, when she was discharged as an E-4. During her service, she held \na clearance; was deployed twice for 15-months to a combat area; and was awarded three \nArmy Commendation Medals for distinguished performance, a Good Conduct Medal, and \nreceived a highly prestigious award for exceptional performance. Applicant married in \n2010 and divorced in 2012. She has a daughter, age 12, of this relationship. \nIn 2005, while deployed abroad, Applicant, a friend, and two other soldiers were \nconsuming alcoholic beverages. After a verbal altercation, she threw a drink into a \nsoldier\u2019s face and all four were involved in a physical altercation. The two other soldiers \nwere intoxicated. There is no evidence Applicant and her friend were intoxicated. She \nreceived an oral reprimand for the offense. (GE 6) In May 2008, Applicant completed 16 \nhours of ASAP. She testified that she attended ASAP to earn promotion points, and not \nbecause she was ordered to do so. (AE 14; GE 3) \nApplicant attended college between 2009 and 2014. While in college, Applicant \nstudied Arabic. The Arabic class also hosted Middle East students learning English. The \nprofessor required students to interact and teach each other their respective languages. \nIn early 2014, Applicant met a citizen of Saudi Arabia in the Arabic class, and they \ndeveloped a romantic relationship. (Tr. 19-20) In December 2014, he graduated and \nmoved back to Saudi Arabia. He returned to the United States in early 2015, but the \nrelationship had ended in May 2015, except for a few emails. \nApplicant has had no personal contact with the Saudi national since 2015. In April \n2017, he contacted Applicant by email to tell her he was back in the United States to \ncomplete his doctorate degree, and informed her he was working at the Saudi embassy. \nThey had infrequent email contact until June 2017. Applicant has had no contact with the \nSaudi Arabian citizen during the last three years. She reported her contact with the Saudi \nnational in her April 2017 SCA.

He is 38 years old and entered the United States in 2010 \non a student visa and never left. They met via a dating website in November 2015. After \nsome dating in early 2016, they started living together as a couple in July 2016. \nApparently, he moved out of her apartment in July 2017, and the relationship ended in \nFebruary 2018 for 10 months. \nIn December 2018, Applicant and IC rekindled their relationship and are now in a \nlong-distance romantic relationship. He is a chemical engineer working on developing \nbatteries for a company in another state. Applicant and IC communicate daily via \ntelephone calls, emails, or text messages. The relationship is getting more serious. He is \nschedule to visit Applicant\u2019s parents sometime after the hearing. Applicant has met his \nparents and other family member via the internet. (Tr. 65-73) \nAccording to Applicant, IC never worked for the Indian government and is not \ninvolved with its military or intelligence services. She does not know what IC\u2019s parents do \nfor a living in India or whether he has relatives with connections to the Indian government, \nits military, or intelligence services. She does not know how IC paid for his master\u2019s \neducation in the United States; however, she believes he did a work-study program for \nhis doctorate, and either the Indian government helped him or he received a scholarship. \n(Tr. 113-114) She reported her contact with IC in her April 2017 SCA. (GE 1) \nIn 2015, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages to excess. While intoxicated, \nshe fell through a pharmacy door and used the pharmacy\u2019s bathroom. While in the \nbathroom, she stole about $289 of merchandise. The next day, Applicant walked into a \npolice station and self-reported her misconduct. She was charged with burglary, theft, \nreceiving stolen property, and criminal mischief. In December 2015, pursuant to a pre-\ntrial agreement, Applicant plead guilty to simple criminal trespass. She was fined $300, \nplus court costs, and paid $300 in restitution. All other charges were dismissed. (GE 7) \nFollowing this incident, Applicant did not seek substance abuse counseling. \nIn February 2017, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages to excess while taking \nChantix, a smoke cessation drug. Chantix was prescribed to Applicant by a Veterans \nAffairs physicians\u2019 assistant. (AE 15) Chantix\u2019s literature indicates that some people \ndevelop changes in behavior including agitation, hostility, depression, suicidal thoughts, \naggression, hallucinations, and paranoia. The drug also increases the impairment due to \nalcohol consumption. (AE 16) \nWhile intoxicated, Applicant\u2019s behavior became aberrational, as if suffering a \npsychotic episode. She abruptly left her apartment without proper clothing or shoes for \nthe weather conditions. She had suicidal ideations, and climbed a tree, from which she \nfell. She was screaming belligerently and police officers responded. Applicant resisted \narrest and physically assaulted several police officers. She was charged with aggravated \nassault, drunkenness, and disorderly conduct. In September 2017, she pled guilty to \ndisorderly conduct hazardous/physical offense. She was fined $300 and required to pay \ncourt costs and fees.

The evaluation was performed by a Veterans Affairs physician with a \ndoctorate degree in psychology. Applicant told the psychologist she first consumed \nalcohol when she enlisted in the Army at age 18. Her heaviest consumption period \noccurred while in the service, from age 18 to 21. She reported having about a dozen \nblackouts during that period. After her discharge, she substantially reduced her alcohol \nconsumption because she was raising her daughter as a sole parent. She claimed that \nprior to the February 2017 incident, she was consuming about a six-pack of beer or a pint \nof vodka over the course of a weekend. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder \u2013 mild. No follow-up treatment was recommended. (AE 17; GE 3) \nAfter her February 2017 incident, Applicant did not seek alcohol counseling. She \nstopped drinking for about three months, and then started consuming light beer. She \nconsumed approximately six light beers during a period of three to five hours, twice a \nmonth while socializing. The consumption of six beers made her feel a little giddy. (GE 5) \nApplicant testified that she has not been involved in any alcohol-related misconduct after \nFebruary 2017. However, she has continued consuming alcohol to the point of \nintoxication. The last time she remembers drinking to intoxication was in May 2019. In her \nJuly 2020 answer to interrogatories, Applicant indicated she was consuming three to five \nbeers daily with dinner, about two mixed drinks once a month, and two to four glasses of \nwine monthly. Her most recent consumption of alcohol was two weeks before the hearing, \nafter returning from a deployment. (Tr. 105) \nIn May 2019, Applicant participated in a psychological evaluation requested by the \nDOD CAF. It was performed by a licensed psychologist. (GE 2) The report indicates that \nafter the February 2017 incident, Applicant resumed consuming alcoholic beverages in \nJune 2017. She claimed she was consuming light beers, five or more drinks on a bi-\nmonthly basis. In May 2019, Applicant stated she does not consume alcohol while \ndeployed - about seven times since she was hired, for a period of about three months at \na time.  \nApplicant reported to the psychologist in 2019 that she currently consumes \napproximately eight glasses of wine per week, but not every day. She noted the greatest \nnumber of drinks she will consume include a six-pack of light beer over a weekend, \napproximately five times per month. \nAccording the psychologist, Applicant has engaged in habitual binge drinking to \nthe point of impaired judgment; used alcohol to cope with emotional distress; does not \nacknowledge her substance abuse issues; and continues to engage in binge drinking and \nregular use of alcohol. The psychologist concluded Applicant has an alcohol use disorder, \nmoderate. Because Applicant continued to drink after her history of legal charges, the \npsychologist believes her drinking behavior seems imprudent and considered her \ndiagnosis as guarded. She concluded Applicant presents a condition that could pose a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsignificant risk to her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified \ninformation.

Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAppellant was involved in three alcohol-related incidents that occurred in 2005, \n2015, and February 2017. The 2015 and 2017 incidents demonstrate that she has \nconsumed alcohol excessively and to the point of impaired judgment, establishing the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional . . . \nof alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigating conditions that may be applicable to this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s 2005 incident appears to be loosely related to her alcohol \nconsumption. The military police reports do not show she was intoxicated or that alcohol \nwas a factor in her throwing her drink into another soldier\u2019s face. She was only orally \nreprimanded because of her misconduct. \nThe 2015 alcohol-related misconduct shows that Applicant engaged in binge \nalcohol consumption. To her credit, the next morning she self-reported her misconduct to \nthe police. Her most recent alcohol-related misconduct occurred in February 2017. \nApplicant drank alcohol while taking Chantix. The medication\u2019s literature indicates that \nsome people develop changes in behavior including agitation, hostility, depression, \nsuicidal thoughts, aggression, hallucinations, and paranoia. The drug also increases the \neffects of alcohol intoxication. Applicant\u2019s behavior became aberrational, as if suffering a \npsychotic episode. Thus, this incident could be attributed to the drug reaction with alcohol. \nShe stopped taking Chantix after the February 2017 incident. \nApplicant abstained from consuming alcohol during a period of three months after \nFebruary 2017, and subsequently established a pattern of modified, responsible alcohol \nconsumption. She successfully completed all court-mandated substance abuse \ncounseling. Considering the evidence as a whole \u2013 particularly the lack of any additional \nalcohol-related misconduct after February 2017 - Applicant has demonstrated an \nestablished pattern of modified, responsible consumption of alcohol. \nI considered that Applicant has continued consuming alcohol after the two \ndiagnoses of alcohol use disorder (both mild and moderate); that she only completed the \ncourt-ordered substance abuse counseling; that she has not participated in any aftercare \ntreatment; and that she believes she does not have an alcohol problem. I also considered \nthat the DOD CAF psychologist considered Applicant\u2019s prognosis as guarded, and her \ndrinking imprudent, because she continued to drink after her history of legal charges. She \nconcluded that Applicant presents a condition that could pose a significant risk to her \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant made lifestyle changes to eliminate her alcohol-related \nproblems, and she abstained from consuming alcohol for a period and has established a \npattern of modified consumption after February 2017. I believe that it is unlikely that \nAppellant will engage in alcohol-related misconduct. As a result of the security clearance \nprocess, she is aware that any additional alcohol-related misconduct could cause her to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nlose her clearance eligibility, and potentially her job. Applicant\u2019s supervisors believe that \nher performance is excellent and would like her to continue working for them. Another \ncoworker recommended she retain her clearance eligibility. In light of the evidence as a \nwhole, I find that Applicant has demonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior to \nconclude that the questionable judgment associated with her alcohol-related misconduct \nis behind her. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nBetween early 2014 and May 2015, Applicant dated a Saudi Arabian citizen \nresiding in the United States under a student visa. Apparently, his father has connections \nto the Saudi government, and in 2017, the ex-boyfriend was working in the Saudi \nembassy. Applicant no longer maintains a relationship with the Saudi citizen. He last \ncontacted her in June 2017. She reported the relationship in her 2017 SCA. Considering \nthat the relationship ended in 2017, Applicant\u2019s past relationship with the Saudi citizen no \nlonger raises a Guideline B security concern. \nApplicant has an ongoing romantic relationship with an Indian citizen (IC) residing \nin the United States on a work visa. IC is 39 years old. He entered the United States in \n2010 under a student visa and never left the country. They met in November 2015. After \nsome dating, they started living together as a couple in July 2016. He moved out of her \napartment in July 2017, and the relationship temporarily ended in February 2018. In \nDecember 2018, Applicant and IC rekindled their relationship and are now in a long-\ndistance romantic relationship, apparently with a view toward getting married. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence did not indicate whether IC\u2019s parents or other relatives living \nin India have connections to the Indian government, its military, or intelligence services. \nIt is also not clear whether the Indian government sponsored IC\u2019s education in the United \nStates. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to coercion from foreign governments or other entities. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThere is evidence of a threat of domestic terror, sectarian violence, criminal \nactivity, and ongoing human rights problems in India. Additionally, India and its citizens \nhave engaged in technological, economic, and industrial espionage against the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a potential conflict of interest, and there \nis evidence of a risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to IC, her possible in-laws, and their \nconnections to India are sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b). \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant ties to IC and his connections to close relatives \nin India. India is generally regarded in the United States as a friendly country. However, \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has \na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any \nperson, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United \nStates.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. India has significant human rights \nabuses that continue without punishment for those involved; and that terrorist incidents \nhave occurred throughout India. Additionally, India and its citizens have engaged in \ntechnological, economic, and industrial espionage against the United States. \nThe evidence shows that the government of India conducts intelligence operations \nagainst the United States. Because of IC\u2019s relatives and their property and financial \ninterests in India, Applicant, directly or through IC, could be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of IC\u2019s family members and the interests of the United \nStates. \nApplicant is a solid American citizen. She served in the Army and was deployed to \ncombat areas. She attended college in the United States and has established herself \nfirmly as a solid American citizen. She is respected at work for her performance, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. She has been promoted to a lead position because of her \nexcellent performance. All of Applicant\u2019s financial and property interests are in the United \nStates. She shares custody of her 12-year-old daughter, born in the United States, with \nher ex-spouse. \nApplicant credibly testified that her loyalty is only to the United States, she is not \ninterested in visiting India, and she would promptly report any efforts by anyone to obtain \nany classified information from her, even if it was her boyfriend. She does not have any \ncontacts with her boyfriend\u2019s relatives in India, except for one virtual meeting. \nOn balance, I find that Applicant submitted sufficient evidence of her ties to the \nUnited States. There is no conflict of interest because Applicant has established \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. She can be expected to \nresolve any possible conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Her most important \nfamily interests all reside in the United States.

An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFor APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFor APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On an unspecified date, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set \nof interrogatories. Applicant responded to those interrogatories on June 20, 2019. On May \n1, 2020, the DCSA CAF issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

In addition to the FORM, \nApplicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines \napplicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on November 13, 2020. His \nresponse was due on December 13, 2020. Applicant did not to respond to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 7, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.i.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a production technician II with his current employer since March 2018. He previously \nworked for a variety of employers as an electronics technician from May 2016 until March \n2018; as an electronics technician from January 2016 until May 2016; as a \ntelecommunications specialist from April 2014 until May 2015; and as a field service \nrepresentative in Afghanistan for different defense contractors from August 2013 until \nApril 2014; and from July 2012 until August 2013. He is a May 1995 high school graduate \nwith some university credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy (USN) in January \n1996, and served on active duty until January 2012, when he was honorably discharged \nas an E-5. During his active military service, he was deployed to Bahrain, Oman, and \nDjibouti (September 2004 until March 2005); to Iraq (September 2009 until March 2010); \nand Bahrain (September 2010 until July 2011). He served in the USN inactive reserve \nfrom January 2012 until January 2015. He was granted a secret clearance in 2007. \nApplicant was married in 2002. He has two children, born in 2002 and 2005, respectively, \nas well as two stepchildren, born in 1994 and 1996, respectively. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can \nbe found in the following exhibits: Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, undated); Item 2 (SF 86, \ndated March 22, 2017); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated July 3, 2018, and \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubject Contact, dated July 17, 2018); Item 7 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated May 4, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 9, \n2019); Item 4 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated June 20, 2019); and Item 5 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated October 29, 2020). \nFinancial difficulties are not new to Applicant. On January 28, 2009, the \nDepartment of the Navy (DON) CAF issued him an SOR citing security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). On April 2, 2009, the DON CAF issued him a \nfavorable determination indicating that he had submitted sufficient mitigating \ncircumstances and explanations to support a favorable decision. Nevertheless, despite \nthe favorable determination, he was strongly cautioned to avoid similar derogatory \ncircumstances. (Item 8, SOR and Favorable Determination) \nApplicant went through two separate periods of unemployment. The initial period \noccurred upon his discharge from active duty, and it lasted from January 2012 until July \n2012. During that period, he was supported by unemployment benefits and G.I. Bill funds \nfor school, and he attended a university from March 2012 until October 2012. The second \nperiod started when he was terminated due to a communications issue in May 2015, and \nlasted until January 2016. During that period, he was supported by unemployment \nbenefits, savings, and his wife\u2019s part-time employment wages. \nIn July 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). During the interview, he acknowledged only two \ndelinquent accounts. One referred to a repossessed automobile, and the other was \nrelated to student loans and G.I. Bill benefits for which there were conflicting facts. As a \nresult of the student loan issue, Applicant explained that his wages were garnished ($200 \nper month until February 2017). He did not submit any documentation to support the \ngarnishment. He denied having any other delinquent accounts. When the OPM \ninvestigator confronted him with other delinquent accounts, Applicant either claimed to be \nunaware of the account(s) or recalled some facts regarding other accounts. On July 3, \n2018, he described his financial situation as improving, and he claimed that he was able \nand willing to repay all debts. He contended he was on a budget. He acknowledged that \nhe had never received financial counseling. (Item 3, at 10-11) During a subsequent \ninterview, he recalled additional facts pertaining to some of the accounts he had already \ndiscussed. (Item 3, at 13) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that he has not always been \nthe most financially responsible person, but he had always tried to live within his means. \nHe attributed his financial problems to having lost a very high paying job in 2015, and his \nover six-month period of unemployment. He contended that he prioritized his bills, and \npushed the bills that were not immediately important off to the side while trying to care for \nhis family of six individuals. When he obtained new employment, it was at a lesser salary, \nand he fell back even further financially. He borrowed money from his family, and although \nhe repaid most of what he had borrowed, he was still in the process of doing so. (Item 1) \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,711, but it \nfailed to allege any delinquent balances for two of the alleged accounts, and simply \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalleged that they had been charged off. In fact, two of the alleged accounts refer to the \nsame account during different phases of existence. The accounts are set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to an automobile loan for Applicant\u2019s stepson. His stepson \nstopped making the $500 monthly payments when he lost his job in January 2015, and \nalthough Applicant tried to continue making those payments, when he lost his own job, \nhe too was eventually unable to continue doing so, and the vehicle was voluntarily \nrepossessed in February 2016. The vehicle originally cost $22,000, and although the \naccount was charged off in the amount of $17,234 in May 2016, the SOR alleged that the \nunpaid balance is $11,847. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 1; Item 7, at 2; Item 3, at 10) In the \nnearly five years since the repossession, Applicant has made no effort to enter into \npayment arrangements with the creditor or make any payments. (Item 4, at 2) The \naccount has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to an unsecured loan that Applicant\u2019s wife took out for her \ndaughter, in Applicant\u2019s name, using his power of attorney. Payments stopped being \nmade in June 2016, and the unpaid balance of $5,056 was charged off. In July 2018, \nApplicant told the OPM investigator that he was \u201ccurrently working\u201d with the creditor to \nset up a payment plan, and that he was willing and able to pay the debt. (Item 5, at 4; \nItem 6, at 2; Item 7, at 6; Item 3, at 13) Since he made that statement, Applicant has made \nno effort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor or make any payments. \n(Item 4, at 2) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of \n$4,247 that was placed for collection. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2) Applicant has made no \neffort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor or make any payments. (Item \n4, at 3) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to an unspecified type of retail account with an unpaid balance \nof $969 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (Item \n5, at 2; Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 11) Applicant contended that the account was associated \nwith his daughter\u2019s dental services, and that she had repeatedly failed to make payments. \n(Item 3, at 11) He has made no effort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor \nor make any payments. (Item 4, at 3) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.h. refer to the same bank-issued credit-card account with an \nunpaid balance of $640 that was charged off and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 3; \nItem 6, at 2) Applicant has made no effort to enter into payment arrangements with the \ncreditor or make any payments. (Item 4, at 3) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $460 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 6, at 2) Applicant has made no effort to enter into payment \narrangements with the creditor or make any payments. (Item 4, at 4) The account has not \nbeen resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to a bank-issued credit-card account with a high credit of $793 \nthat became delinquent and placed for collection. An unspecified balance was charged \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noff.

(Item 4, at 4) The account has not \nbeen resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. refers to a student loan or G.I. Bill overpayments with an unpaid balance \nof $2,492 that was placed for collection. (Item 7, at 11) It remains unclear if Applicant has \nmade any effort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor or make any \npayments. The account has not been resolved. \nAs noted above, when Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in July \n2018, he claimed to be willing and able to pay his delinquent accounts. Nevertheless, he \noffered no evidence that he had entered into any repayment arrangements or made any \npayments to his creditors. In June 2019, he submitted a Personal Financial Statement in \nwhich he indicated that his net monthly income was $4,900; his monthly expenses were \n$4,055.25; and that his monthly remainder available for discretionary spending or savings \nwas approximately $845. Despite claiming that he was repaying a family loan, he listed \nno loans or other debts under the debts section of the Personal Financial Statement. (Item \n4) His current financial situation is not known. He claimed that he had a family budget, \nbut he offered no documentation to support his claim. In the absence of additional more \nrecent financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a \nbetter position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,711, but it \nfailed to allege any delinquent balances for two of the alleged accounts, and simply \nalleged that they had been charged off. In fact, two of the alleged accounts refer to the \nsame account during different phases of existence. Although Applicant contended in July \n2018 that he was willing and able to pay his identified creditors, since that time he offered \nno evidence to indicate that he tried doing so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, and because of his previous indication of an ability to resolve his debts, along \nwith a monthly remainder of approximately $845, and his inaction with respect to \nsatisfying his debts, AG \u00b6 19(b) has also been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other mitigating conditions apply. A \ndebt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing \nfinancial issues, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve those delinquent \naccounts, despite repeated promises to do so, make it rather easy to conclude that they \nwere not infrequent and they are likely to remain unchanged, much like they have been \nfor several years. Applicant has attributed his financial issues essentially to his 2015 \nperiod of unemployment, and subsequent much lower salary. But he also acknowledged \nthat he has not always been the most financially responsible person. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in March 2017; underwent his OPM interviews in June \n2018; completed his responses to the interrogatories in June 2019; the SOR was issued \nin May 2020; and the FORM was issued in November 2020. Each step of the security \nclearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the financial issues \nconfronting him. With respect to his delinquent debts, he offered no evidence that he took \nany action to resolve any of those debts. Instead, he made promises to do so, and none \nof those promises were fulfilled. He claimed that he was paying off a family loan, but he \nalso failed to furnish any documentation to support his claim. His own Personal Financial \nStatement indicates that he was making no debt payments to any creditors. By failing to \naddress his delinquent debts, he does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is no evidence, either verbally or supported by \ndocumentation, that Applicant fulfilled his promises or took any good-faith corrective \nactions with respect to his financial issues, to date. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a production technician II with his current employer since March 2018. He previously \nworked for a variety of employers as an electronics technician, an electronics technician, \na telecommunications specialist, and as a field service representative. He was honorably \ndischarged from the USN. During his active military service, as well as while he was a \ncivilian contractor, he was deployed or assigned to various locations in the Middle-East. \nHe was granted a secret clearance in 2007. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has eight delinquent accounts, totaling \napproximately $25,711. Although he initially claimed that he had insufficient funds to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status, and he prioritized his accounts to care for his \nfamily, he indicated in 2018, that he was willing and able to resolve those delinquent \ndebts. But, as of the date the record closed, he had not addressed, much less resolved, \nany of those delinquent accounts. Moreover, other than Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions \nregarding his efforts to resolve a family loan, he admitted that he had not engaged any of \nhis creditors in a dialogue to establish a repayment plan or that he had made any \npayments. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 9, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn February 8, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and he elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He provided a supplement to his \n1 \n\nanswer on July 16, 2021. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on August 31, 2021. He was afforded \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified \nas Items 2 through 9. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM or file objections \nto any evidence offered. All Items are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to \nme on October 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6. 1.a through 1.j, 1.n through 1.q, 1.r, \nand 2.a. He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.m and 1.s through 1.w. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He never married. He has a nine-year-old child. He has \nworked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since July 2018. He was \nunemployed from November 2013 to April 2014. He attended college from 2004 to 2007. \n(Item 3, 4) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2018. In it he did \nnot disclose any delinquent debts. He disclosed that in 2016, he was made aware during \na traffic stop by police that he had an outstanding warrant. He said he was unaware of it. \nThe charge was for criminal mischief from an incident with a former partner. The parties \nagreed that Applicant would make restitution and pay a fine, which he did. He provided \nsupporting documents. The charge was dismissed. (Items 2, 3) (Any derogatory \ninformation that was not alleged in the SOR, will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination, in applying the \nmitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j allege collection accounts for student loans from a state \nguarantor agency. This agency purchases and administers defaulted student loans. The \ntotal amount alleged for these student loans is approximately $18,287. Credit reports from \nJuly 2020 and August 2019 reflect that these student loans became delinquent in July \n2015, and the original creditors were banks. The credit reports do not note when these \naccounts were originally opened. (Items 5 and 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n through 1.q allege collection accounts from the Department of \nEducation for student loans. The total amount alleged for these loans is approximately \n$14,325. Credit reports from July 2020, August 2019, and November 2018 reflect that \nthese accounts were opened in 2008 and 2009 and became delinquent in 2015. (Items \n5, 6, and 7) \nIt appears that all or some of these student loans may have been transferred or \nassigned by the government to other collectors who administer the collection of student \n2 \n\nloans, but I am unable to decipher the specific status of each loan, where it might have \nbeen transferred, and if it was transferred more than once. \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 2021 answer to the SOR, he stated that the student loans \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j were consolidated into a single loan and are in good standing. \nHe does not understand why his credit report reflects that the loans are being listed as \ndelinquent with the state guarantor. He stated that when he reviewed his Equifax and \nCredit Karma reports the delinquent loans were not reflected under the guarantor. He did \nnot provide a copy of these reports. In his supplemental answer, Applicant provided a \ncopy of \u201cloan details\u201d from the loan servicer from July 2021, which reflect a repayment \nstart date of November 2011, and the guarantor is listed as the state guarantor listed in \nthe SOR. The documents provided are for three loans with payoff amounts of $2,898; \n$2,979; and $2,293. The SOR allegations are for ten loans totaling $18,287. (Items 1and \n2) \nIn response to government interrogatories from May 2020, Applicant provided \ndocuments for three loans reflecting they were opened in 2007 and had balances of $927, \n$400, and $5,214. The payment history on the three accounts reflects two missed \npayments in 2019, two missed payments in 2018, one missed payment in 2017, and five \nmissed payments in 2016. There is no information for 2015 and either no information for \n2014 or delinquencies more than 90 days. It is unclear if these are the same loans as \nnoted in his July 2021 answer. (Item 4 pages 26-28) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2019. He was \nconfronted with the delinquent student loans that were in collection from the state \nguarantor (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j), and other delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.l-$253; 1.m - $1,484; 1.r - $628; 1.s - $190; 1.u - $661; 1.v - $576; and 1.w - $332). \nHe said he had no knowledge of what any of these debts were and said his identity had \nbeen stolen in 2015 and 2016. He was confronted with DOE student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n \nthrough 1.q) and said he had no federal debt and all of his student loans were current. He \nsaid he had refinanced his DOE student loans to lower the payments. He let the loans \nbecome past due and put off making payments because he was focused on other \npriorities at the time. He said the loans were delinquent from July 2016 to October 2016. \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with collection accounts. He explained that \nthey were the original carrier of the loans, which were then rolled into the DOE loans. \nIn Applicant\u2019s Mary 2020 responses to government interrogatories, he said he had \nplaced his student loans into deferment because he was unemployed for a period and \nhad other financial obligations such as housing, healthcare, and basic needs. He said he \nwas notified by the Office of Personnel Management in December 2014 that his social \nsecurity number and other identifying information were part of a data breach. This \nhappened to tens of thousands of people who worked in various capacities for the federal \ngovernment. He was provided with free credit monitoring for a year and when he noticed \na credit card had been compromised, he requested it be extended. He said he disputed \ncertain entries on his credit report and requested verification from other creditors. (Items \n2, 4) \n3 \n\nApplicant provided letters he sent to the credit bureaus in July 2021. For some \naccounts that were not alleged in the SOR, he states he was a victim of identity theft and \nhe never opened the accounts. In the letter to the credit bureau regarding the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.s, and 1.u, Applicant provided the account name, its balance, and \nthe original creditor. He then stated: \u201cI never had a contract with this debt collector for any \ndebt. Please provide proof from the original creditor that this debt collector owns this debt \nand has the legal authority to collect it or delete this account.\u201d In his answer to the SOR, \nhe stated the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l and 1.u were disputed as being opened in his \nname without his consent due to identity theft. His letter to the credit bureau asks that the \noriginal creditor verify it sold the debt to a collector who now has the legal authority to \ncollect the debt. In his July 2021 letters, Applicant is not disputing the original debts and \ndoes not claim the debts were incurred through identity theft. He stated he did not have \na contract with the collector, not that he never owed the debt. I did not find Applicant\u2019s \nstatements credible. I find these accounts legitimately belong to Applicant, and they are \nunresolved. They are supported by entries on his credit reports. \nIn the letter regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.r, he stated: \u201cThis account was charged \noff and I no longer owe money to this creditor but it\u2019s still showing a balance due.\u201d This \nwas a credit card that was opened in 2012 and defaulted on in 2014. In his February 2021 \nanswer he stated: \u201cI acknowledge [creditor] this matter was a compromised charge that \noccurred in relation to the OPM leak. It was considered delinquent and charged off before \nI received information from OPM stating as such.\u201d I did not find Applicant\u2019s statements \ncredible. The account was opened in 2012, before the breach. This account remains \nunresolved. (Items 2, 5, 6, 7) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t, 1.v and 1.w are medical accounts. The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.t was incurred in December 2012 and \u00b6 1.w was incurred in April 2014. Applicant \nstated in his answer that he had contacted the creditors seeking information about the \ndebts and questioning the validity of them. He provided no additional information. The \nmedical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.v is listed in Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit report, but does not identify \na specific creditor. It is not listed in subsequent reports. I find in his favor for this allegation. \nThe other debts are unresolved. \nApplicant did not provide any evidence he has participated in financial counseling. \nHe did not provide information as to his current income, expenses, budget or financial \nstability. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent student loans and other unpaid debts. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThere is some evidence that Applicant\u2019s identity may have been misused. \nHowever, for the debts alleged in the SOR, there is sufficient evidence they are legitimate \ndebts. Although Applicant stated he disputed some, he did not provide evidence that the \ndisputes were resolved in his favor. There is some evidence that Applicant consolidated \nstudent loans and has a payment plan with the loan servicer. However, there is insufficient \nevidence to identify which loans were consolidated and the status of those remaining. \nBased on the number of loans and the different balances owed, it is unlikely that they all \nwere included in the payment plan. There is also evidence that these loans were in a \ndefault status and were in collection. Those that are with the loan servicer are no longer \nin default, but Applicant has the burden to provide evidence regarding all of the student \nloan allegations. He did not. I am not in position to decipher which student loans are now \nheld by the loan servicer, which are still held by the state guarantor, and which are with \nDOE, if any, and their current status. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there was a \nmoratorium on the collection of student loan payments. The evidence supports that \nApplicant defaulted on the student loans years before the pandemic. \nThere is also sufficient evidence to conclude that the medical debts and other \nconsumer debts alleged in the SOR belong to Applicant and are unresolved. Although, \nhe said he disputed them with the credit bureaus, he did not provide the results of the \ndispute or that they have been removed from his credit report. Applicant acknowledges \ncertain delinquent debts, and requested that the original creditors verify they transferred \nthe debts to the collection agency, who then can act on them. This inquiry does not negate \nhis obligation to pay his delinquent debts. I have considered that Applicant was a victim \nof identity theft, but he presented insufficient evidence to conclude that these debts did \nnot belong to him. Applicant provided snippets of information, but not enough to meet his \nburden of persuasion. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that are ongoing and unresolved. The \nstatus of his current finances are unknown. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant was \nunemployed for a period in 2013 and 2014. He did not provide any other financial \ninformation for what may have impacted his ability to pay his debts. There is evidence he \nwas a victim of identity theft and he disputed debts that were removed from his account. \nHe also provided evidence that he is paying three of his student loans and they are \ncurrent. However, Applicant has numerous other student loans and other delinquent \ndebts that he did not provide sufficient evidence to show they are either resolved, or he \nis addressing them. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \n7 \n\nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. There is evidence that Applicant is paying three student loans through a\nloan servicer. As I stated above, I cannot decipher which loans on the SOR he is paying. \nIn the interest of fairness, I have chosen three SOR allegations from the guarantor that \ncome closest to the balances alleged and loan servicer\u2019s balances. They are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.i and 1.j. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts, and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor on these \nallegations. \n \n \nApplicant disputed many of the debts, but he failed to provide sufficient \ndocumented proof to substantiate that the debts alleged did not belong to him. He has \nnumerous student loans, but failed to provide evidence to show which ones were \nconsolidated and being paid and the status of the others. He said he was the victim of \nidentity theft, but he acknowledged certain debts and then disputed them because they \nwere turned over to collection agencies, and he wanted the original creditors to verify their \nactions. He disputed another debt because it was charged off, and he wanted it removed \nfrom his credit report. Applicant is responsible for providing evidence of these disputes. \nHe provided letters he sent to the credit bureaus, but not the results of the disputes. He \nfailed to provide evidence of action he may have taken to resolve his medical debts. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(e) has limited application. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was charged in July 2016 with criminal mischief. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \n8 \n\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant was charged with criminal mischief in 2016 due to an issue with his ex-\npartner. The prosecutors agreed to dismiss the case if Applicant paid restitution. There \nwere limited facts available. It appears the restitution was for a broken window. Applicant \npaid the restitution and is eligible to have the charge expunged. It has been five years \nsince the criminal behavior. It appears he is no longer in a relationship with this person. I \nfind AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a significant history of financial problems. He has numerous student \nloans and other delinquent debts. He had the opportunity to provide evidence to show the \nstatus of each of the debts. Insufficient evidence was provided, and he failed to meet his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant successfully mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns, but failed \nto mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n9 \n\n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Henderson Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/17/2021 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on April 4, 2017. On \nMay 21, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a date not reflected in the record, and requested \na decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 28, 2020, the \nGovernment sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material \n(FORM), including pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6. \nHe was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, \nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on November 13, 2020, and did not respond.

Items 2 through 6 are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on January 7, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matter \nItems 4 and 5 contain the policies of Applicant\u2019s current employer that relate to \nemployee drug use. In the absence of an objection by Applicant, I admitted both Items \nbecause they are relevant to the issue of Applicant\u2019s drug use. However, each Item bore \na date that was outside of the alleged period of Applicant\u2019s drug use and, thus, were \naccorded less weight. The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s drug use ended in \u201capproximately \nlate summer of 2017.\u201d Item 4 is a copy of a code of conduct dated January 2020. Item 5 \nis a copy of the procedures related to a drug and alcohol free workplace program dated \nApril 2018. No evidence was proffered to establish that similar policies were in place \nbetween May 2012 and late summer 2017. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 40, has never married nor had children. He earned a high school \ndiploma in 1999, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003, and a master\u2019s degree in 2005. He has \nbeen employed as a software engineer by three different defense contractors from 2005 \nthrough present. He has worked for his current employer since September 2017. He has \nmaintained a DOD security clearance since 2006. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant used and purchased psilocybin mushrooms approximately two to three \ntimes per year from May 2012 through late summer of 2017. He estimated that he used \nthem no more than a dozen times during that period. His use occurred while in social \nsettings, such as parties and music or other festivals. He usually purchased one bag of \nmushrooms during a festival that he attended from \u201cvarious people\u201d at the festival. He \nspent approximately $30 per bag, which typically consisted of four \u201csmall\u201d mushrooms. \nHe generally used at least half of the mushrooms at the festival, and then saved any \nleftover mushrooms for use at a later time. The SOR did not allege facts about his \nmushroom purchases so I will consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole \nperson concept. (SOR Answer; Item 2 at 24-25; Item 3 at 4, 11) \nApplicant reported his mushroom use on his April 2017 SCA. He further discussed \nit during his August 2018 security clearance interview (SI), in his March 2020 response \nto interrogatories (ROI), and in his SOR answer. He attributed his first use of mushrooms \nto being depressed over a breakup. He continued to use them because it was \u201ckind of \nfun.\u201d He explained that he never \u201cconsciously decided\u201d to stop using mushrooms, but \n\u201cthey just hold so little influence in my life I don\u2019t actively seek them.\u201d When using \nmushrooms, he feels euphoric and sees colors and shapes differently. He has never been \ndiagnosed as drug dependent. (Item 3 at 5, 6, 11). \nApplicant gave varied responses about his future intent with respect to using \nmushrooms. In his SCA, he stated that he had no intent to use them in the future because \n\u201cthey are difficult for me to acquire.\u201d During his SI, Applicant stated that it was \u201cpossible\u201d \nthat he might use mushrooms in the future. He described his mushroom use as \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cmanageable and controlled.\u201d He stated that he did not believe that his mushroom use \nwas a habit or \u201cbad for him.\u201d He admitted that it was \u201cnot good judgment\u201d to use illegal \ndrugs while holding a security clearance. However, when asked if a person that \ndemonstrates poor judgment should hold a security clearance, he responded that there \nare \u201clevels of poor judgment.\u201d He then explained that he used mushrooms in a \u201ccontrolled \nenvironment\u201d without harming himself or negatively impacting anyone else. He denied \nhaving knowledge of his current employer\u2019s drug-use policy. In his ROI, Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had intentions of using mushrooms in the future. (Item 2 at \n25; Item 3 at 8, 12) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied ever having stated that he \u201cintend[ed] to \ncontinue to use mushrooms in the future,\u201d as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. However, he admitted \n\u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll never use [mushrooms] again.\u201d He acknowledged that \u201cADDICTION \nis bad, regardless of whether the addiction is something legal or illegal.\u201d However, he \ndenied having an \u201caddiction problem\u201d given that the frequency of his mushroom use was \n\u201cat the most frequent\u201d only three times in a year. Applicant asserted that he has proven \nhimself \u201cvery trustworthy\u201d and \u201cloyal\u201d to the defense of the United States because he was \nso forthcoming about his mushroom use (which he referred to as an \u201cindiscretion\u201d). (Item \n1) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s use of psilocybin mushrooms establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and \nAG \u00b6 25 (g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used and purchased psilocybin mushrooms several times per year over \na five-year period, during which time he possessed a security clearance. While he was \ncandid about it during the security clearance process, Applicant minimized his conduct \nand never fully acknowledged how serious a lapse in judgment it was. He provided \nconflicting statements about his future intent. He failed to accept responsibility for the fact \nthat he not only used and purchased an illegal drug, but also violated his security \nclearance obligations. \nInexplicably, Applicant believed that the circumstances of his mushroom use did \nnot rise to the level of poor judgment that would preclude him from eligibility for a security \nclearance. The fact his mushroom use occurred during a relatively short phase of his life \nand ended more than three years ago weighs in his favor. However, he failed to meet his \nburden to establish mitigation sufficient to overcome the significance of his use while in \npossession of a security clearance and his failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \nabstinence. I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement is unlikely \nto recur and have doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his illegal drug use. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Payments on the loans are suspended due to COVID relief. Applicant started repaying the loans in November 2020, with a $1,400 payment, followed by monthly $500 payments. He paid a total of $4,900 and reduced the total balance on the loans to $33,312. (Tr. at 17, 22-23, 28-29; GE 2-6, 8; AE A) The seven remaining student loans are handled by a different loan servicer.

He went through periods \nof unemployment and underemployment after graduate school. The SOR alleges 12 \ndefaulted student loans totaling about $89,000 and an unidentified $1,180 medical debt. \n(Tr. at 19-22; GE 2-6, 8) \nApplicant owes the U.S. Department of Education for five of the student loans. \nThe total balance of the loans was $38,609. Payments on the loans are suspended due \nto COVID relief. Applicant started repaying the loans in November 2020, with a $1,400 \npayment, followed by monthly $500 payments. He paid a total of $4,900 and reduced \nthe total balance on the loans to $33,312. (Tr. at 17, 22-23, 28-29; GE 2-6, 8; AE A) \nThe seven remaining student loans are handled by a different loan servicer. In \nMarch 2021, Applicant was approved for a loan rehabilitation program. He is required to \npay $5 per month for at least nine months, at which time the loans will be in good \nstanding. Applicant made the first three payments. He plans to continue the payments \nand then attempt to have the loans transferred to the Department of Education, so that \nhe can make one monthly payment. (Tr. at 18-19, 23-24; GE 2-8; AE A, B) \nApplicant admitted owing $157 to a medical account, but he denied owing \n$1,018. The July 2019 combined credit report lists a medical debt of $1,180 in \ncollection. The debt is reported by all three credit reporting agencies. The name of the \ncreditor is not identified in the credit report. The debt was assigned in July 2015 with a \ndate of last activity of June 2019. A medical debt of $1,180 is not listed on any of the \nsubsequent credit reports. Applicant established that he paid a $157 medical debt in \nOctober 2020. (Tr. at 15-17; GE 2-6; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s finances are otherwise stable. He has a good job. He does not have a \nlavish lifestyle.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes defaulted student loans and an \nunpaid medical bill, is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nThis is primarily a defaulted student loan case. Applicant went through periods of \nunemployment and underemployment after graduate school. He started repaying five of \nhis loans in November 2020, with a $1,400 payment, followed by monthly $500 \npayments. He paid a total of $4,900 and reduced the total balance on the loans from \n$38,609 to $33,312. He is current on a loan rehabilitation program for the seven \nremaining student loans. \nI am satisfied that the medical debt is resolved. Applicant\u2019s finances are \notherwise stable. He has a good job, and he does not have a lavish lifestyle. He credibly \ntestified that he intends to continue paying his student loans. Applicant has a plan to \nresolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to implement that plan. He \nacted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. The above mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

He attended \ncollege from August 2012 to May 2018. While in college, Applicant\u2019s curiosity and \ndesire to fit in socially with his classmates caused him to use illegal drugs. \nHe \nexplained that his decision to use illegal drugs was not a spur of the moment decision, \nbut rather an informed decision with months of research behind it. \nHe used and \npurchased marijuana with varying frequencies from approximately January 2017 to \napproximately July 2019. He used cocaine on one occasion in about October 2017. He \nalso used ecstasy from about March 2014 to August 2016. Applicant was hired by his \ncurrent employer in July 2019. He is currently awaiting his employment start date \ncontingent on the outcome of his security clearance application. (Government Exhibit \n2.) \nApplicant used marijuana one to two times a week on average from January \n2014 through July 2018, by smoking it or edibles while with friends in college at his or at \ntheir apartments. He then used it three more times, the last use occurred in March \n2019. In total, he believes he has used marijuana 300 to 350 times. From January \n2017 to July 2019, he would purchase marijuana at times every month or two from \ndispensaries because it was legal in the state. Applicant stated that he used marijuana \nto decompress from a high academic workload or a long day at work. He explained that \nit was a replacement to consuming alcohol, as he is allergic to alcohol, and he does not \nlike the way it makes him feel. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nDuring his interview with the authorized DoD investigator on November 12, 2019, \nApplicant stated that he last used marijuana in March 2019. Applicant used marijuana \nrecreationally with friends. He also remembers purchasing marijuana for his brother on \none occasion in June or July 2019, when his brother did not have his debit card. \nApplicant also admitted that he has used Adderall without a prescription on one \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccasion in 2015 or 2016.

His friend would acquire it, and Applicant normally used it when \nthey attended music festivals. Applicant was told by his friends that when attending a \nmusic festival he should use ecstasy to get the most out of the experience. Applicant \nlast used ecstasy in August 2016. (Government Exhibits 1 and 2.) \nIn October 2017, Applicant used cocaine on one occasion with college friends.  \nApplicant was drinking at a party, when cocaine was offered to him. He stated that he \nused it due to peer pressure from friends at the party where everyone else was using it. \n(Government Exhibits 1 and 2.) \n \nApplicant states that he no longer associates with any of his college friends or \nanyone who uses illegal drugs.  He does not intend to use any illegal drug in the future.  \nHe stated that the marijuana was always a temporary activity that he only planned to do \nwhile in college.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  Since graduating from college in May 2018, \nhowever, Applicant continued his marijuana on at least three more occasions.  He \nstated that he used it while visiting with friends he had not seen in a long time.  He \nregrets this use.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nApplicant argues that he could have said nothing about his drug use on his \nsecurity clearance application, and the DoD would only be aware of one transaction for \npurchasing marijuana after it was legalized for recreational use. \nRather than \ndeliberately lie on his application, he chose to disclose his extensive drug use history. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nOther than his admissions to the allegations in the SOR, the record is void of \nevidence in mitigation. There is nothing in the record in the way of documentary \nevidence to substantiate his eligibility for access to classified information. There are no \nletters of recommendation to substantiate his character. There is no statement of intent \nacknowledging that any further use of any illegal drug would result in automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance. It appears that Applicant stopped using marijuana \njust before he was hired by his current employer in order to try to obtain a security \nclearance. The evidence in this record is inadequate to grant access to classified \ninformation to this applicant. Applicant is young, and has made some poor decisions in \nthe past concerning the use of illegal drugs. It is not clear from his evidence that he \nunderstands the great responsibilities involved in holding a security clearance. It is also \nnot clear whether he understands that the use and purchase of marijuana is against \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFederal law. Although he states that his last use of marijuana occurred about 19 \nmonths ago, he also stated that he planned to discontinue his use of marijuana when he \ngraduated from college in 2018, and did not do so. Applicant continued to use it after \ncollege. Applicant is a college-educated man, whose actions have shown immaturity \nand poor judgment that is inexcusable. More evidence is needed to show that he has \ncommitted himself to a drug free lifestyle and can properly protect classified information. \nAt this time, he does not show the required level of good judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live his life to his \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the requisite character or judgment of someone who has the \nmaturity, integrity, good judgment, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. \nApplicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified \ninformation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. While holding a security clearance one is \nexpected to show responsibility and good judgment. Applicant has not demonstrated \nthe level of maturity needed for access to classified information. \nThis is not an \nindividual with whom the Government can be confident to know that he will always \nfollow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. He is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot qualified for access to classified information.  Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance.          \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

On April 8, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn May 21, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

He denied \nthe two remaining allegations. His comments with respect to both his admissions and his \ndenials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in \nthe record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a tool and fabrication inspector with his current employer since 2019. He previously \nserved as a quality control inspector for other employers from 2011 until 2018. A 2009 \nhigh school graduate, he received a technical school certification as a medical assistant \nin 2011; some college credits, but no degree; and he is currently enrolled in an unspecified \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) program. He has never \nserved with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been \nmarried. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86); GE 2 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated May 2, 2019); GE 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, \ndated April 9, 2019); GE 3 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 17, 2019); and \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Answer). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to several factors which depleted his \nfinancial resources and led to several financial accounts becoming delinquent: in around \n2014, his father experienced heart problems and underwent surgeries for which Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npaid the expenses; they resided together until 2019, and he paid the rent and for food; he \nwas unemployed for two months in 2017 (during which he received unemployment \nbenefits); he was involved in an automobile accident which totaled his vehicle, but his \ninsurance company refused to cover the damages; he needed transportation to get to \nwork and school so he purchased another vehicle; and his identity was stolen. He failed \nto submit any documentation to support or verify his contentions with respect to his \nfather\u2019s health issues and payments; the insurance issues; or identity theft. \nIn March 2019, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he acknowledged that there \nwas a delinquent automobile loan since 2012. On May 2, 2019, during an interview with \nan investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant \nacknowledged several identified delinquent accounts, but claimed to be unaware of \nseveral other described delinquent debts. He contended that he had matured and was \nnow living within his means; budgeting; prioritizing accounts; checking prices before \nmaking purchases; and seeking financial advice from friends who are good with their \nfinances. He described his finances as \u201cgetting better and improving.\u201d He stated an \nintention to look into those accounts about which he was unaware, and setting up \npayment arrangements. He denied that his failure to pay his accounts was intentional, \nand explained that he simply could not keep up with them. (GE 2) \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, charged \noff, or for which there was a repossession, totaling approximately $35,847, as set forth as \nfollows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to an automobile loan with a high credit of $22,185 made in 2012 \nthat became delinquent in 2013 after the vehicle was totaled but not covered by \ninsurance. In February 2013, $19,675 was charged off, but the creditor still reports a past-\ndue-balance of $25,374. (GE 4, at 5; GE 3, at 1; GE 2, at 4-5; Answer, at 1) Applicant \nacknowledged that he had not even attempted to contact the creditor to resolve the \ncharged-off account for the past five years. (Tr. at 47) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to an automobile loan with a high credit of $19,599 made in 2014 \nthat Applicant voluntarily returned via repossession when his monthly payments \n\u201cskyrocketed\u201d and he was faced with increased medical expenses for his father. In \nNovember 2014, $4,521 was charged off. (GE 4, at 5; GE 3, at 2; GE 2, at 6; Answer, at \n1) Applicant acknowledged that he last contacted the creditor about the account in 2017, \nbut claims he was told that the account had been charged off. (Tr. at 50-51) During the \nhearing, he stated that he had no intention to pay off the account, \u201cat the moment.\u201d (Tr. \nat 50) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to an automobile loan with a high credit of $10,564 made in 2015 \nthat was involuntarily repossessed in 2018. Applicant claimed that he was late with one \nmonthly payment and that there were \u201chidden\u201d late-payment fees. He spoke with the \ncreditor, but one morning the vehicle was gone. In January 2019, $3,061 was charged \noff. He has not made any effort within the past four years to resolve the account, and he \nintends to dispute it.

The account was for one of Applicant\u2019s \nvehicles that he no longer had, but failed to notify the company that he no longer had it to \ncancel insurance coverage. (GE 4, at 13; GE 3, at 2; Tr. at 54-55) He acknowledged that \nhe had made no efforts to resolve the account until two months before the hearing, and \nhis current intent is to pay it off. He previously disputed the account for unspecified \nreasons. (GE 3, at 2) He now contends he and the creditor agreed to have monthly \npayments to commence shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic. (Answer, at 2; Tr. at 56) \nApplicant offered no documentary evidence to support the existence of a repayment \nagreement. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to medical account \u2013 actually referred to by Applicant as a dental \naccount \u2013 with an unpaid balance of $412 that was placed for collection in 2019. (GE 4, \nat 12; GE 3, at 2; Answer, at 2) Although he initially had no recollection of the account, \nhe did subsequently acknowledge that the delinquency occurred after he was laid off in \n2017, and his coverage had lapsed without his knowledge. He acknowledged that he had \ninitially made no efforts to contact the creditor, and then claimed he was unsuccessful in \nattempting to do so in 2019. (GE 2, at 5; Tr. at 57) Applicant intended to contact the \ncreditor after Memorial Day in 2020 to establish a repayment plan. (Answer, at 2) He \nnever contacted the creditor. (Tr. at 77) Applicant offered no documentation or testimony \nto verify that such a plan had been established or payments made. The account has not \nbeen resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g. refer to two medical accounts with unpaid balances of $169 \nand $132 that were placed for collection in 2019.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nApplicant has nine delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, charged \noff, or for which there was a repossession, totaling approximately $35,847. Those \naccounts became delinquent essentially because of Applicant\u2019s inability to maintain them \nin a current status either because he had insufficient funds to do so, or he had other \nprioritized accounts and expenses, or that there was identity theft. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nhave been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to \nsatisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. As noted above, Applicant attributed his \nfinancial problems to several factors: his father\u2018s health issues; his covering those \nexpenses as well as for the rent and for food; his brief period of unemployment; the \nautomobile accident which totaled his vehicle; he needed transportation to get to work \nand school so he purchased another vehicle; and identity theft. While some of those \nissues might have increased his expenses for short periods, in the absence of specifics, \nnone of them were largely beyond his control for the long term. He denied that his failure \nto pay his accounts was intentional, and explained that he simply could not keep up with \nthem. Applicant failed to submit any documentation to support or verify his contentions \nwith respect to his father\u2019s health issues and payments; the insurance issues; or identity \ntheft. \nIn May 2019, during his OPM interview, Applicant contended that he had matured \nand was now living within his means; budgeting; prioritizing accounts; checking prices \nbefore making purchases; and seeking financial advice from friends who are good with \ntheir finances. He described his finances as \u201cgetting better and improving.\u201d He stated an \nintention to look into those accounts about which he was unaware, and setting up \npayment arrangements. However, he subsequently acknowledged that he had made no \nefforts during substantial periods, including several years, to resolve his accounts beyond \nclaiming that he had some unverified future repayment arrangements. He indicated no \nintent to resolve one automobile loan, at the moment (SOR \u00b6 1.b.); two accounts that \nwere supposedly the result of identity theft (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g.) were not challenged or \nreported to authorities; and he said he would contact one creditor to determine if the \naccount was valid (SOR \u00b6 1.i). As of the hearing, none of the delinquent accounts had \nbeen resolved. Instead, he simply furnished documentation showing that some routine \nmonthly expenses for other accounts were being made. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing financial difficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his \ndelinquent accounts, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is \nlikely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are some promises, but \nno actual resolution efforts over lengthy periods. Also, the payment of some normal \nmonthly expenses, to the exclusion of any payments towards the delinquent debts, does \nnot excuse the avoidance of addressing the SOR-related delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. It remains difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, \nespecially since he failed to submit the requested Personal Financial Statement. \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \ntool and fabrication inspector with his current employer since 2019. He previously served \nas a quality control inspector for other employers from 2011 until 2018. A 2009 high school \ngraduate, he received a technical school certification as a medical assistant in 2011; \nsome college credits, but no degree; and he is currently enrolled in an unspecified \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) program. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has nine delinquent accounts that were placed for \ncollection, charged off, or for which there was a repossession, totaling approximately \n$35,847. Three automobiles were repossessed. Applicant acknowledged that he had \nmade no efforts during substantial periods, including several years, to resolve his \naccounts beyond claiming that he had some unverified future repayment arrangements. \nAs of the hearing, none of the delinquent accounts had been resolved. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.

His acknowledged inaction in \ncontacting his creditors, as well as his unverified actions regarding identity theft and \ndisputed accounts, demonstrate that he has no plan to resolve his financial problems. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.

Alternatively, she was \nadvised that if she objected to the entire PSI on the ground that it was unauthenticated \nby a government witness, it would not be entered into evidence.

The typewritten page numbers in the upper right-hand corner of the page will be cited \nwhen referring to page or pages of the PSI.  \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges twelve delinquent student loan debts totaling $67,844. These \ndelinquent accounts appear in government credit bureau reports dated November 20, \n2020 (Item 6), February 4, 2020 (Item 7), and March 23, 2019 (Item 8). In her answer, \nApplicant admitted the delinquent accounts. However, she declared that she was paying \n$53 a month and the accounts were in good standing.

She has been living with \nher parents since February 2019. She received a high school diploma in May 2006, and \na bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2011. Since January 2019, Applicant has been \nemployed as a help desk engineer.

(Item 4 at 7, 13-20; Item 5 at 4) \nIn her February 2019 e-QIP, Applicant reported that she had no debts. She \nvacationed in the Caribbean for two or three days in September 2018, and again in April \n2015.

In August 2017, she spent between one and five days on vacation at a location \nin the Caribbean. (Item 4 at 27-29, 34) \nAfter completing her e-QIP in February 2019, Applicant provided a PSI in April \n2019 (Item 5). She claimed her student loans were deferred until August 2019, and not \npast due. The credit reports do not report any of the student loan accounts in a deferred \nstatus at any time. Rather, they are all posted as either in collection, transferred, or closed. \nThe last payment activity date on most of the accounts is November 2017, while Applicant \nwas employed as a claims adjuster. (Item 5 at 8; Items 6 at 6-7; Item 7 at 2; Item 8) \nApplicant explained that repaying the student loan accounts became a problem \nsix months after she graduated from college in December 2011. (Item 5 at 8) She recalled \npaying $50 a month in the past on the accounts, and planned to consolidate the accounts \nin the future. She did not foresee these financial problems repeating themselves in the \nfuture because she was managing her financial obligations under a balanced budget. \nApplicant has never received financial counseling. (Item 5 at 8) She provided no \nsupporting documentation to validate her claims of making any payments on the accounts \nor consolidating them. She provided no independent evidence to substantiate her claim \nof having a balanced budget. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other trust issues \nof personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nResponsibly managing ones financial obligations is an essential attribute for an \nindividual seeking security clearance eligibility. An individual who displays financial \nirresponsibility may also demonstrate irresponsible or negligent conduct in safeguarding \nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s PSI, the Government credit bureau reports, and her undated answer \nto the May 2020 SOR establish the Government\u2019s case under the financial considerations \nguideline. It is well-settled that negative information, i.e. delinquent accounts and charged \noff or collection accounts within credit bureau reports, can establish a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations under Guideline F. \nApplicant has twelve delinquent student loan accounts totaling $67,844. She \nstated that repayment of the student loans became a problem about six months after she \ngraduated from college. The credit reports show that she stopped paying on most of the \nstudent loan accounts in November 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAn applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion of producing evidence that \nrebuts or mitigates the Government\u2019s case and meets her burden of demonstrating she \nmerits eligibility for security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe only mitigating condition that is partially applicable is AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s \nfour-month period of unemployment between September 2018 and January 2019 was an \nunanticipated event beyond her control. However, the credit reports reflect that she \nstopped paying most of the student accounts approximately 10 months earlier in \nNovember 2017, when she was employed. While Applicant receives some mitigation \nunder the first prong of the mitigating condition because of the unforeseen unemployment, \nshe receives no mitigation under the second prong of the condition, \u201cacting responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d She resumed working in January 2019, but furnished no \ndocumentary evidence of addressing the student loan accounts. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because \nthe accounts, which became delinquent less than three years ago, are 12 in number. The \nlikelihood that the debts will continue in the foreseeable future raises doubt about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and judgement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply \nbecause Applicant has not received financial counseling and there are no indications the \naccounts are being resolved or under control, and Applicant produced no evidence of a \nbalanced budget. \nThough the loan accounts became delinquent less than three years ago, in her \nApril 2019 PSI and her answer to the May 2020 SOR, Applicant made several claims \nabout the status of her student loan accounts. However, she provided no documentary \ncorroboration of those claims, such as: (1) proof of payments; (2) ongoing proof of \ncommunication with her student loan creditors of the reasons why she was unable to \nmaintain payments and when she would able to resume payments; or (3) attempts to \nnegotiate payment plans or deferral arrangements of payments altogether. \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \ncontext of the entire record. Applicant\u2019s unsupported claims that the student loan accounts \nare being paid and in good standing have not been established. It is important to note that \nin 2017 and 2018, instead of addressing her delinquent student loan accounts, she was \ntaking vacations in the Caribbean and Central America. There are no indications that \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness is being reduced or is under control. Having weighed the \nevidence from a commonsense point of view, Applicant has not overcome the security \nconcerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l:   \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact 2 The Findings of Fact in my initial decision, dated April 8, 2021, are incorporated by reference. Applicant has a history of financial problems established by 12 delinquent student loan accounts totaling $67,844. Her only unemployment since 2011 was from September 2018 to January 2019, when she was hired into current position as a help desk engineer. In her February 2019 security clearance application, Applicant claimed that she had no delinquent debts. I found no documentary evidence from the credit reports validating Applicant\u2019s claims in her April 2019 personal subject interview (PSI) with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that the student loans were in a deferred status until August 2019, or that she was making payments on the accounts or consolidating them. She furnished no documentary evidence in her undated answer to the May 2020 SOR that she was paying $53 a month on the loans and they were in good standing. Applicant\u2019s screen shot evidence confirms her communications with the FSO on December 7, 2020 and January 13, 2021. The fact that these communications support her contention that she made a timely response to the FORM does not prove the status of her financial aid payments and deferments, and why some of her loans were not being paid on time. What happened to the packet of information is regrettable, but I am unable to simply accept Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertions about the contents of the packet of information. I draw t",

Overall, she submitted no evidence to demonstrate \nher debts were being reduced or under control.  \nIn the Appeal Board\u2019s August 2021 Remand Decision, the Board found that \nApplicant\u2019s evidence of screen shots of December 7, 2020 and January 13, 2021 \n(attached to her appeal brief) confirm that her facility security officer (FSO) had \npossession of the packet of information that Applicant mailed to DOHA and indicated he \nwould resend the packet to the correct address. As the Appeal Board found, Applicant\u2019s \ntimely response to the FORM did not reach the record in this case for my review. \nAccordingly, the Board remanded the case for me to issue a new decision. \nOn August 20, 2021, I emailed Applicant informing her that I was reopening the \nrecord in compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s August 11, 2021 Remand Decision. This \ndocument is identified as Hearing Exhibit 1 (HE) 1. Applicant was given until September \n27, 2021, to submit additional documentary evidence in support of her evidentiary \nclaims. \nOn October 12, 2021, at 12:44 p.m., Department Counsel advised Applicant by \nemail that the Government had received no documentary evidence by the September \n27, 2021 deadline. (HE 2) Department Counsel also asked her to confirm whether she \nhad sent additional evidence and when. Alternatively, if she chose not to reply with \nadditional evidence, Department Counsel advised her to indicate accordingly. \nOn October 12, 2021, at 1:04 p.m., Applicant replied to Department Counsel by \nemail. She explained that she had no copies of the packet of information she submitted \nthrough the FSO to DOHA because she trusted that the documents would reach their \ndestination at DOHA. She explained that the packet contained evidence of financial aid \npayments, deferments, and responses to allegations about why some of her loans had \nnot been paid on time. She noted that she currently lives overseas and was unable to \nreconstruct all of the original evidence in her possession while she was in the states in \n2020.

Applicant has a history of financial problems established by 12 delinquent \nstudent loan accounts totaling $67,844. Her only unemployment since 2011 was from \nSeptember 2018 to January 2019, when she was hired into current position as a help \ndesk engineer. \nIn her February 2019 security clearance application, Applicant claimed that she \nhad no delinquent debts. I found no documentary evidence from the credit reports \nvalidating Applicant\u2019s claims in her April 2019 personal subject interview (PSI) with the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that the student loans were in a \ndeferred status until August 2019, or that she was making payments on the accounts or \nconsolidating them. She furnished no documentary evidence in her undated answer to \nthe May 2020 SOR that she was paying $53 a month on the loans and they were in \ngood standing. \nApplicant\u2019s screen shot evidence confirms her communications with the FSO \non December 7, 2020 and January 13, 2021. The fact that these communications \nsupport her contention that she made a timely response to the FORM does not prove \nthe status of her financial aid payments and deferments, and why some of her loans \nwere not being paid on time. What happened to the packet of information is regrettable, \nbut I am unable to simply accept Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertions about the \ncontents of the packet of information. I draw this conclusion based on: (1) the incorrect \ninformation she provided in her February 2019 security clearance application about \nhaving no delinquent debts; (2) her uncorroborated April 2019 PSI claims about the \nloans being in deferment and not delinquent; and (3) the unsubstantiated claims in her \nundated answer to the May 2020 SOR that she was paying $53 a month on the student \nloan accounts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at \ngreater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern \ninsofar as it may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, \ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a \nnon-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nRevised Analysis \nThe Analysis and Whole-Person Concept discussion set forth in my initial \ndecision, dated April 8, 2021, are incorporated by reference. Based on Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations provided in her April 2019 PSI and her undated answer to the May 2020 \nSOR, she could have attempted to retrieve other documentation from bank sources to \nshow that she has continued to make payments on the student loan accounts. She \ncould have attempted to obtain documentation from the student loan lenders that would \nvalidate her contentions regarding the status of the deferments. Even though the \nPresident of the United States decided to hold student loan payments in abeyance as a \nCovid 19 relief measure during the pandemic, Applicant\u2019s loan accounts had been \ndelinquent for more than a year before the President issued the moratorium. She could \nhave provided a more detailed explanation of why some of the student loan accounts \nhad not been paid on time. If she could not acquire the documentation, she could have \nat least reported her unsuccessful efforts. Although her unanticipated unemployment for \nfour months from September 2018 to January 2019 was beyond her control, Applicant\u2019s \nlack of documented evidence to support her claims is insufficient to mitigate the \nguideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n_____________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The debts are established by \nher security clearance application (SCA), credit reports from September 2019 and \nMarch 2020, and her SOR admissions in her answer.

Her credit \nreport indicates that her original loan was opened in April 2017 and the date of her first \ndelinquency was in December 2017. It also shows a history of missed payments from \n2018 through 2020. Applicant documented that she sought a mortgage modification \nagreement in approximately March 2020. She failed to provide documentation showing \nthat the modification was ever executed, or showing her monthly mortgage payments \nwere being made. The loan modification documents she provided were all unsigned. \nThis debt is unresolved.

This debt is unresolved. (Items 2 (including her attachment with \nsettlement offer), 11-12) \nCredit Card (SOR \u00b6 1.d)-$961 charged off.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. Her history of \nfinancial difficulties dates back to 1997. I find the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are recent \nand two remain unresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to show that her \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. On the contrary, the evidence shows that she \nhas had financial difficulties tracing back to 1997. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant \nadmitted that she was not financially responsible in the past. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. Her efforts to resolve her student loans and two other debts are commendable, \nbut insufficient to conclude that her overall financial problems are being resolved or are \nunder control. Likewise, she has failed to establish a good-faith effort to resolve her \nremaining delinquent debts. Although she claimed that she hired a financial counselor, \nthere is no documentation of what that gained for her. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not established a \ntrack record of financial stability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

The subsequent background \ninvestigation revealed the pending security concerns, which are based on information \nApplicant disclosed during his five Agency interviews in 2012. \nApplicant\u2019s interest in diapers started when he was five-six years old. He would \noccasionally wear his younger sister\u2019s diapers. When he was 10 years old, he became \nsexually aroused when he touched the outside of a two-year-old\u2019s diaper. At age 15, he \nmasturbated after holding his infant cousin in a diaper. While in high school, he stole a \npackage of diapers because he was too embarrassed to pay for them. Between 2007 \nand 2012, he used diapers at least once a week for sexual gratification. He wears the \ndiapers at home when he is alone. He enjoys to excrete and to masturbate in the \ndiapers. Applicant denied feeling aroused by any stimuli other than the diapers (i.e., \nmen, women, children, naked bodies, breasts, etc.). He repeatedly denied any sexual \nattraction to children. \nApplicant admitted to doing many internet searches for diapers and viewing \nimages of children wearing diapers (at least once a week during a six-month period). He \ndenied that this images were of a sexual nature. He viewed the images because he is \nsexually aroused by the diapers, and not who is wearing them. He unintendedly viewed \nchild pornography many times up until two or three years before his 2019 mental \nevaluation. The feeling that he was doing something wrong when he searched for \nchildren in diapers became too much for him to ignore, and he has been trying to stop \nhis behavior. Applicant repeatedly explained that he has never been aroused by \nchildren or adults regardless of the sex, and he has never sought out child pornography. \nHis fixation is with the actual diapers. \nApplicant experienced disgust and shame in response to the unintended viewing \nof child pornography and immediately discontinued the image search. To stop \ninadvertently accessing child pornography, he began viewing drawings of children and \nadults wearing diapers while dressed in animal costumes (the \u201cfurry community\u201d). The \ndrawings and he \u201cfurry community\u201d provide him with gratification. During the last 10 \nyears, Applicant has been making a concerted effort to stay away from all children. He \ndoes not want to put himself in a position where he potentially could inappropriately \ntouch a child. \nApplicant experiences significant shame and anxiety associated with his sexual \npredilections. Only his brother, Agency and DOD investigators, his counsel, DOHA \npersonnel, and some of his mental health providers are aware of his fetish. Applicant \nbelieves that his participation in the security hearing and testifying about his fetish \ndemonstrate that he has improved substantially managing his depression and anxiety \nand that he cannot be blackmailed or manipulated by someone who may gain \nknowledge of his sexual preferences. He promised to disclose any attempts to \nmanipulate him to security officials and never to divulge classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant participated in a psychological evaluation performed \nby Dr. E (a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Psychology and a Health Service Provider in \nPsychology (HSPP)), appointed by the DOD CAF. Dr. E quickly dismissed initial \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s violent tendencies (thoughts of harming himself and others, \nhim being a psychopath), and at risk of substance addiction, by noting that there was no \ndata to support any of those possibilities. \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s diaper fetish, Dr. E noted that Applicant has limited \ninsight about his fetish. He does not know why he developed the interest or how he \nmight discontinue the behaviors. Applicant admitted to Dr. E that he viewed child \npornography in the past, but credibly explained that he was looking only to see images \nof diapers and never for the purpose of sexual gratification via images of children. Once \nhe became aware and felt badly enough about doing so, he switched to searching for \nimages of drawings of children in diapers and images of people wearing diapers while \ndressed in animal costumes. \nIn his evaluation report, Dr. E noted that his research suggests that there is only \na weak link between the diaper fetish and pedophilia. He noted that \u201cwhile [Applicant] \ndoes engage in atypical sexual behaviors, the data does not support concerns that he is \nexhibiting signs and symptoms of pedophilia.\u201d There is no real evidence that Applicant \nhas pedophilic tendencies. \nDr. E noted a number of favorable factors found during the evaluation that in his \nopinion mitigate Applicant\u2019s difficult psychological, behavioral, and societal problems. \nHe has been working for his employer since 2012 without incident. His supervisor \nfavorably endorsed Applicant for a clearance. Applicant is considered to be a rule \nfollower, and he would be the first to report something out of the ordinary, and the last to \nviolate security protocols. \nDr. E highlighted that Applicant has been engaging with mental health providers \nfor many years. Applicant first sought mental health care when he was 15 or 16 for \nanger management issues. Dr. E\u2019s mental evaluation report quotes the DOD \ninvestigative report indicating that he was seen for counseling in 2008, at age 19. \nBetween October and December 2016, he saw Dr. V for anxiety, depression, and the \ndiaper fetish. He then continued treatment with MB (a licensed professional counselor \n(LPC) with a master\u2019s degree in mental health (M.A.)) at the same practice, beginning in \nJune 2017 to an unknown date. Both Dr. V and MB reported to DOD investigators that \nthey did not believe Applicant has any condition that could impair his reliability, \njudgment, or trustworthiness, and both assessed Applicant\u2019s prognosis as fair. (GE 5) \nWhile in counseling, Applicant also consulted with Dr. A (psychiatrist) between \nOctober and November 2016. Dr. A reported to DOD Investigators that in his opinion, \nApplicant did not have any condition that could impair his reliability, judgment, or \ntrustworthiness, and assessed Applicant\u2019s prognosis as fair.

Both EL and Dr. JC reported to DOD investigators that in \ntheir opinion, Applicant did not have any condition that could impair his reliability, \njudgment, or trustworthiness, and assessed Applicant\u2019s prognosis as fair. \nIn the summer of 2018, Applicant started seeing Dr. MS (psychiatrist) and social \nworker DS for depression, anxiety, and the fetish. Applicant attended weekly therapy \nsessions and was prescribed an anxiety medication with good results. In July 2019, DS \nwas interviewed by Dr. E during his preparation of Applicant\u2019s mental evaluation. DS \nstated that he had been treating Applicant for about a year. He described Applicant as a \nhard worker and a rules follower, who is motivated to do well in life. In DS\u2019s opinion, \nApplicant functions well enough overall that he does not believe his mental health \naffects his ability to do his job. DS has no concerns about Applicant having access to \nclassified information or working in a secured setting. DS believes Applicant was \nmaking good progress controlling his mental health symptoms and understanding his \nfetish. His medication had reduced his anxiety symptoms, and he has been consistent \nin treatment. \nDS noted Applicant experiences shame associated with his fetish because he is \naware that his desires and behavior are not considered normal. In his opinion, Applicant \nwould be horrified if information about his fetish surfaced publicly, but in MS\u2019s opinion \nApplicant would not betray his country or divulge sensitive information because of his \noverriding rule-following tendencies. Applicant did not discuss with DS his arousal as a \nresult of viewing children wearing diapers until he was issued the SOR. \nDr. E diagnosed Applicant as follows: (GE 5) \nF65.0 Fetishistic Disorder \nF33.9 Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, unspecified \nF41.9 Anxiety Disorder, unspecified (with signs of Generalized Anxiety, PRSD,\n  Panic, Agoraphobia, and Social Anxiety) \n \nHe opined that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is fair. Dr. E concluded that: \u201cwhile he has a \nnumber of important behavioral and mental health challenges, Applicant has enough \nmitigating factors to conclude that his conditions do not negatively impact his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness in the context of safeguarding sensitive information and \nworking in a cleared setting.\u201d (GE 5) \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented his own psychological evaluation performed \nby a licensed psychologist, Dr. Y (Ph.D.), in April 2001.

He has not engaged in \nany sexual contact with a child, nor does he has the desire to do so. To avoid incidental \nviewing of child pornography, Applicant has chosen to remove people from the process \nentirely. He limits his behavior to wearing diapers himself, sexually interacting with \ndiapers (without others present), and viewing diaper-related pornographic cartoons \ntypical of the \u201cfurry community\u201d (not involving people). (AE E) \nApplicant submitted a written declaration by DS, a licensed clinical social worker \nwith a master\u2019s degree. DS has provided therapy to Applicant for depression and \nanxiety disorder from 2018 to present. In his opinion, Applicant has learned and used \nnew coping skills that have improved his depression and anxiety. He believes that \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to put himself through the investigation and clearance process \nspeaks to his improvement with his anxiety and depression. He noted that from the \nbeginning, Applicant has fully participated and attended all scheduled therapy sessions. \nDS stated that Applicant has been apprehensive about joining websites that \nfocus on fetishes due to his understanding of the cyber world that this information would \nbe seen by anyone looking for him. He stated that he wanted to stay off the grid. DS \nstated that he trusts Applicant with the security of the United States and recommends \nhim for a clearance. (AE D) \nApplicant\u2019s manager and team lead provided a declaration in support of \nApplicant. He has known Applicant since 2012, and has been his direct supervisor for \nthe last four years. He has never observed Applicant engage in any conduct that would \njeopardize national security or the security of the company\u2019s products. In his opinion, \nApplicant is one of the hardest working, most responsible and supportive people he \nworks with. He is of high character and sound moral judgment. He has not seen \nanything in his actions, behavior, or emotions that would lead him to believe Applicant \nshould not be given a clearance. He fully trust Applicant and confidently recommends \nhis eligibility for a clearance. He is unaware of Applicant\u2019s fetish.

(AE D) \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nApplicant was diagnosed with a fetishistic disorder. He engaged in sexual \nbehavior of a compulsive nature related to diapers; sought imagery related to diapers \nfor arousal and masturbation purposes; inadvertently viewed child pornography multiple \ntimes; stole diapers; feels significant shame and anxiety associated with his sexual \npredilections; and does not want his sexual behavior to be discovered by others. \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature; whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment.  \nApplicant unintendedly viewed child pornography many times up until about \n2016. The sexual behavior of a criminal nature is not established by the evidence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(a) is not applicable to this case. Applicant admitted to inadvertently seeing \nimages of child pornography while looking for children wearing diapers. The 11th Circuit \nCourt said: \nInadvertent receipt of child pornography is not a violation of the statute . . . \nSection 2252A(a)(2) criminalizes only \u201cknowing\u201d receipt. This element of \nscienter carries critical importance in the internet context given spam and \nthe prevalence and sophistication of some computer viruses and hackers \nthat can prey upon innocent computer users. \nUnited States v. Pruitt, 638 F.3d 763, 766 (11th Cir. 2011). \nThere is no evidence of him deliberately searching, possessing, or transferring \nimages of child pornography. Presumably, each time when he \u201cinadvertently\u201d viewed an \nimage of child pornography while looking for diapers, he was surprised and immediately \nclosed the image and did not download it into his computer. Applicant testified, and the \navailable record evidence supports the conclusion, that his fetish is specifically related \nto diapers. He is only sexually aroused by the diapers, regardless of who is wearing \nthem. (Of course, not being sexually aroused by child pornography is not a defense to \nthe crime of possession of child pornography.) Applicant has been in treatment with at \nleast eight mental health providers-therapists since 2016. Those to whom Applicant \ndisclosed his diaper fetish, including Dr. E (DOD CAF psychologist), opined that \nApplicant\u2019s fetish does not involve children. Dr. E noted that there is no evidence to \nshow that he has pedophilic tendencies. \nApplicant has taken significant steps to avoid the accidental viewing of child \npornography. In 2016, he stopped looking for images of children wearing diapers. To \navoid incidental viewing of child pornography, Applicant has chosen to remove people \nfrom the process entirely. He limits his behavior to wearing diapers himself, sexually \ninteracting with diapers (without others present), and viewing diaper-related \npornographic cartoons typical of the \u201cfurry community\u201d (not involving people). \nAG \u00b6 13(b) is established by the evidence. Applicant\u2019s diaper fetish is \ncompulsive. He continues to wear diapers and seeks sexual release by masturbating in \nthe diapers. He also continues to seek images of \u201cthings\u201d wearing diapers. However, all \nof his behavior is strictly private, behind closed doors at his home and no one else is \ninvolved. He stole a package of diapers when he was in high school, but he now buys \nthem. \nApplicant has been trying to stop his atypical behavior. He sought counseling and \ntherapy to control his depression, anxiety, and his diaper fetish. According to his mental \nhealth providers Applicant is progressing with his counseling and therapy. I find that \nApplicant\u2019s diaper fetish is not \u201cself-destructive, or a high-risk sexual behavior.\u201d He has \nmodified his behavior to avoid contact with images of people, children or adults, to \nensure no more accidental transgressions. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c) is established by the evidence. Applicant\u2019s behavior is atypical - it is \nnot considered normal in our society - and he is keenly aware of it. The fear of being \ndiscovered causes anxiety and depression to Applicant and he does not want his sexual \nbehavior to be discovered by others. Thus, his behavior could make him vulnerable to \nexploitation, coercion, or duress. \nNotwithstanding, I find Applicant\u2019s evidence sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcern. He has been forthcoming during the security clearance process, disclosing his \natypical behavior and discussing it with DOD investigators in 2017. Moreover, Applicant \nsought mental treatment for his depression, anxiety, and fetish starting in 2016, and he \nhas continued his treatment to present. He disclosed his atypical behavior to several of \nhis mental health providers. He was lauded by his therapists for his dedication to his \ntreatment and the progress he has made. \nAs noted by his current therapist, Applicant\u2019s appearance and testimony at his \nsecurity hearing show that he has control of his anxiety and depression, and that he can \nbe expected to report any attempted coercion, exploitation, or duress to his supervisors \nand security officials. Applicant may be embarrassed by his atypical sexual behavior, \nbut he had the fortitude of appearing and testifying about his fetish in a difficult hearing. \nAG \u00b6 13(d) is established by the evidence. In pursuit of his fetish, he stole \ndiapers and viewed child pornography more than once. However, Applicant\u2019s behavior \nis not of a public nature, and it currently does not reflect a lack of discretion or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is partially applicable because his sexual behavior does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Applicant has worked for \nhis company since 2012. His supervisors, who have known and observed him on a daily \nbasis for more that four years, favorably commented on Applicant\u2019s performance, his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(c), (d), and (e) are applicable and mitigate the security concern. \nApplicant has been forthcoming during the current security clearance process. He \nsought mental treatment for his depression, anxiety, and fetish starting in 2016, and he \nhas continued his treatment to present. He was lauded by his therapists for his \ndedication to his treatment and the progress he has made. His prognosis is considered \nfair, but the mental health providers stated that Applicant did not have a condition that \ncould impair his reliability, judgment, or trustworthiness. \nAs noted by his current therapist, Applicant\u2019s appearance and testimony at his \nsecurity hearing show that he has control of his anxiety and depression, and that he can \nbe expected to report any attempted coercion, exploitation, or duress to his supervisors \nand security officials. Applicant may be embarrassed by his atypical sexual behavior, \nbut he had the fortitude of appearing and testifying about his fetish in a difficult hearing. \nGuideline D security concerns are mitigated. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the same sexual behavior alleged \nunder Guideline D. For the sake of brevity, the findings of fact, analysis, and \nconclusions discussed under Guideline D are hereby incorporated in my Guideline E \nanalysis. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during a national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process  . . . .  \nApplicant was diagnosed with a fetishistic disorder. He engaged in sexual \nbehavior of a compulsive nature related to diapers; sought imagery related to diapers \nfor arousal and masturbation purposes; inadvertently viewed child pornography multiple \ntimes; stole diapers; feels significant shame and anxiety associated with his sexual \npredilections; and does not want his sexual behavior to be discovered by others. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the \nfollowing mitigating condition set forth by AG \u00b6 17 as partially or fully raised by the \nevidence: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the same reasons discussed above under the Guideline D mitigating \nconditions, incorporated herein, I find that AG \u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) apply. Applicant is \nunlikely to possess child pornography in the future. Personal conduct security concerns \nare mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D \nand E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, 32, has been employed with a federal contractor since 2012. Two \nclose supervisors with daily contact attested to his professionalism, skills, and \nknowledge, and noted that he is considered a productive member of the company. In \ntheir opinions, Applicant is one of the hardest working, most responsible and supportive \npeople they work with. He is considered to be of high character, reliable, trustworthy, \nand of sound judgment. They trust Applicant and confidently recommend his eligibility \nfor a clearance. \nI considered that Applicant displayed poor judgment when he continued \nsearching the Internet for \u201cdiaper images\u201d after the first time he saw a child pornography \nimage as a result of his search. Notwithstanding, he stopped his questionable behavior \nin 2016, and has taken measures to prevent recurrence. Applicant understands the \npossible criminal consequences, social stigma, and adverse effects on his security \nclearance eligibility if he were to repeat his questionable behavior. \nApplicant sought mental health treatment starting in 2016, and has continued his \ntreatment to present, improving his condition. I find significant that Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth therapist and doctors, in general, do not believe Applicant has pedophilic \ntendencies, or to have engaged in criminal conduct. As stated by the DOD CAF \npsychologist: \u201cWhile he has a number of important behavioral and mental health \nchallenges, Applicant has enough mitigating factors to conclude that his conditions do \nnot negatively impact his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in the context of \nsafeguarding sensitive information and working in a cleared setting.\u201d \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On May 20, \n2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 24, 2020, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on December 9, 2020. On December 10, 2020, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n1 \n\n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on January 6, 2021, and submitted a response that was received on \nFebruary 4, 2021. His response consisted of a narrative, marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA; several letters attesting to his good character and performance of duty, marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits B through Q; and copies of an email exchange with the CAF regarding \nits failure to send him a copy of the Directive when it sent him the SOR.

Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the \naccuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; or \nobject to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nApplicant submitted a detailed response to the FORM but did not comment on the \naccuracy or completeness of the PSI summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected \nto act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their \nrights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See \nADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding that it was reasonable for the \nadministrative judge to conclude that any objection had been waived by an applicant\u2019s \nfailure to object after being notified of the right to object). \nThe FORM also included a request that I take administrative notice of relevant \nfacts about the People\u2019s Republic of China. I granted the request. In addition, on my own \nmotion and without objection, I have taken administrative notice of facts set out in the \nDepartment of State document, \u201cU.S. Relations with China, Bilateral Relations Fact \nSheet,\u201d dated August 22, 2018.

(GX 3 at 4.) Applicant has two children, ages 18 and 20, who are \nnative-born U.S. citizens. \nApplicant\u2019s mother was a retired accountant before she passed away in 2006. His \n84-year-old father is a citizen and resident of China and is a retired hotel manager. His \nfather married a citizen and resident of China in 2007. His father\u2019s 78-year-old second \nwife is a retired nurse. Applicant\u2019s 58-year-old sister is a citizen and resident of China and \nis a retired technical school teacher. \nApplicant and his father have set boundaries on interaction between them. When \nApplicant\u2019s father decided to remarry, Applicant asked him to postpone the wedding until \nhe could attend. His father responded: \nSon, I always love you and your mother no matter what happens. However, \nas both of us are adults, I\u2019m not in the same family with you anymore. We \nhave [our] own separate families and make independent decisions for [our] \nown families. Yours is in USA, mine is in China. . . We respect each other \nbut never make decisions for each other since you were over 18. . . . \n(AX A at 10.) \nApplicant and his wife have also set boundaries at home regarding discussion of \nApplicant\u2019s work. His wife and daughters know that he is involved in sensitive work, but \nthe \u201cfamily rule\u201d prohibits asking him about his job or his long and sometimes unusual \nworking hours. Applicant\u2019s father is aware of the \u201cfamily rule\u201d and respects it. (AX P.) \nApplicant\u2019s 82-year-old father-in-law is a citizen and resident of China and is a \nretired senior engineer who worked for a Chinese ship designer. Applicant\u2019s 77-year-old \nmother-in-law is a citizen of China who is a retired researcher who worked at a Chinese \nobservatory. She came to the United States in September 2015 to be closer to Applicant\u2019s \nfamily, and she is now a permanent resident of the United States. (GX 2 at 30; GX 3 at \n5.) \nApplicant has visited his family members and in-laws in China two times during the \nlast ten years. He maintains telephonic contact with his parents. He has occasional \ntelephonic contact with his sister, about one or two times a year. He rarely talks to his in-\nlaws. \nApplicant and his wife have a combined annual income of about $200,000. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister, and mother-in-law receive pensions and are financially self-\nsufficient. In accordance with Chinese tradition of \u201cred envelope\u201d gifts, Applicant and his \nwife send money to their parents on holidays such as the Chinese New Year. In the \nChinese culture, the gifts are expressions of affection and respect, and they are not \nintended as financial support. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring the past ten years, Applicant and his wife have sent the following monetary \ngifts, which are listed in Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR: \n\uf0b7 $1,000 to Applicant\u2019s father on December 16, 2009 \n\uf0b7 $1,500 to Applicant\u2019s father on February 2, 2011 \n\uf0b7 $1,500 to Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law on June 15, 2011 \n\uf0b7 $2,000 to Applicant\u2019s father on January 2, 2012 \n\uf0b7 $3,000 to Applicant\u2019s father on July 1, 2012 \n\uf0b7 $1,800 to Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law on October 12, 2015 \n\uf0b7 $800 to Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law on February 3, 2015 \n\uf0b7 $1,500 to Applicant\u2019s father on February 3, 2015 \n\uf0b7 $2,000 to Applicant\u2019s father on March 23, 2017 \nI have taken administrative notice that China has an authoritarian government \ndominated by the Communist Party. The government aggressively targets sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology and military information, using worldwide intelligence \noperations. It is one of the world\u2019s most aggressive practitioners of economic espionage \nand one of the greatest espionage and cyber-attack threats to the United States It \npresents a persistent cyber-espionage threat to the U.S. military and critical infrastructure \nsystems. \nThe Chinese government uses its intelligence and influence apparatus to shape \ninternational views and gain advantages over its competitors, including the United States. \nIt uses multiple government entities to acquire restricted U.S. technologies and it \nencourages and rewards private individuals who obtain technology on its behalf. Most \nChinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry are focused on cleared defense \ncontractors and information-technology and communications companies. It is one of the \nleading destinations for illegal exports of restricted U.S. technology. The government \nfrequently gathers intelligence by appealing to an individual\u2019s desire to help the country. \nU.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry with family ties to China are prime intelligence targets. \nIt uses a variety of methods to acquire foreign military and dual-use technologies, \nincluding access to knowledgeable experts under the guise of civilian research, cyber \nactivity, and exploitation of the access of Chinese nationals, such as students or \nresearchers, to act as agents or intermediaries.  \nDespite political disagreements, the United States and the China are major \neconomic and trading partners. As of August 2018, China was the third-largest export \nmarket for U.S. goods (after Canada and Mexico), and the United States was China\u2019s \nlargest export market. \nI also have taken administrative notice that China has a poor human rights record. \nIt suppresses political dissent, and it practices arbitrary arrest and detention, forced \nconfessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Repression and coercion is focused \nprimarily on organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest \nissues. Efforts to silence and intimidate political activists are common.

(AX C.) \nThe U.S. Government representative overseeing defense-related contracts \nperformed by Applicant\u2019s employer submitted a letter including the following comments: \nIn my experience, someone who is reliably truthful in their professional life \nis merely reflecting the core values they hold deal in all aspects of their life. \nAfter 15 years of observing [Applicant\u2019s] demeanor, professionalism, \nrespect for the mission, and work ethic, I trust [Applicant] to always do the \nright thing for our mission and our country.

(AX \nF.) Several other co-workers and supervisors submitted letters on his behalf, uniformly \nexpressing their admiration for his hard work, technical skill, dedication, integrity, honesty, \nand loyalty to the United States.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). It also alleges \nthat Applicant provided approximately $2,000 to $3,000 in annual financial support to his \nfather, mother-in-law and father-in-law, who are citizens of China (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The evidence establishes \nthat Applicant and his wife sent money to Applicant\u2019s father, mother-in-law, and father-in-\nlaw in accordance with the Chinese cultural practice of \u201cred envelope\u201d gifts on special \noccasions. The gifts were a demonstration of affection and respect, and were not financial \nsupport as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. In the context of Applicant\u2019s annual income, the amounts \nwere consistent with being gifts rather than financial support. Thus, I conclude that SOR \n\u00b6 1.c is not established. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \n \nWhen family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); \nsee also ISCR Case No. 09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011).   \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In \nconsidering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any \nterrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did \nnot consider terrorist activity in area where family members resided). \nThe vigorous and comprehensive intelligence efforts employed by the Chinese \ngovernment and its targeting of U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry, especially those in \nscientific and technical fields, are sufficient to establish the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(e) and raise the potential risk in AG \u00b6 7(b). The \u201cred envelope\u201d gifts from \nApplicant and his wife to their parents in China are indicative of their affection and respect \nfor their parents, but they do not raise any independent disqualifying conditions. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant. \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussions of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e). The nature of the relationship between Applicant and his family \nmembers is one of respect and affection. Consideration of the nature of the country \ninvolved is not a consideration of ethnicity, as Applicant suggests in his response to the \nFORM. It involves consideration of the type of government and the policies and practices \nof that government. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have the technical training or \nexperience to be good conduits of the information related to his job. His family members \nare all retired and not likely to attract the attention of government officials. However, \nfactors such as an applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 obscurity do not provide a meaningful measure \nof whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances post a security risk. ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant decided to leave China after experiencing\ngovernmental oppression and protesting against it in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He has\nworked for a defense contractor for 15 years and has established a reputation for integrity,\ndedication, and loyalty. He has held a security clearance since 2006, and his family\nconnections have not significantly changed, except for the death of his mother and\nremarriage of his father. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and his daughters are\nnative-born citizens and have spent their entire life in the United States. His mother-in-\nlaw has become a permanent U.S. resident. The letters from Applicant\u2019s supervisors and\nco-workers are numerous and unusual with respect to their depth, detail, and underlying\ntone of outrage that anyone would question Applicant\u2019s qualifications for holding a\nclearance. I am satisfied that Applicant\u2019s has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the United States that he will resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with \nan immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). There is also a rebuttable presumption that a person has \nties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse. ISCR Case No. 09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). Applicant has not \novercome either of these presumptions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nfamily connections to China. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.5 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.7 An \nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.8 In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern as \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 is that: \n2  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nThe three SOR allegations are established. The record evidence shows the \nfollowing: (1) Applicant began using marijuana in 2010 (at about age 15), and was still \nusing marijuana as of his May 2019 background investigation; (2) he intends to continue \nusing marijuana in the future; and (3) he was arrested and charged with felony \npossession of cannabis in 2013 but not tried or convicted. The disqualifying conditions \nnoted above apply.  \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana as \noutlined in the findings of fact. It includes using marijuana for about a decade and as \nrecently as about May 2019. The latter fact means he smoked marijuana during his \nemployment with a federal contractor engaged in the defense industry. Any illegal drug \nuse is relevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s security worthiness, but it is \nparticularly egregious if it occurs during the course of employment with a federal \ncontractor. Furthermore, I presume his marijuana use in 2019 was in violation of his \nemployer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy.10   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation is not persuasive. The one item that stands out in \nhis favor is his candor and willingness to disclose his marijuana involvement in his 2019 \nsecurity clearance application and during his 2019 background investigation. But the \ncredit in mitigation is limited due to his marijuana use after completing his 2019 security \nclearance application. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n    \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In particular, I gave \nweight to Applicant\u2019s relative youth and inexperience in the ways of the world, but those \nmatters are outweighed by his marijuana use while his security clearance application \nwas pending. I conclude that he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI also considered the two mitigating conditions noted above. Neither applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. His marijuana use occurred on a regular basis over a period of years \nand is recent enough to be of concern. It also occurred while his security clearance \napplication was pending. The latter circumstance cannot be overlooked, ignored, or \nexplained away. Moreover, there is a reasonable likelihood that he has continued using \nmarijuana to the present day, given his expressed intent to continue doing so. \n10 ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd.

(Item 2.) On May 28, 2020, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse), and F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 16, 2020, with \nexplanations and allied documents (Attachments 1 through 6), and requested his case \nbe decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 5, was provided to \nApplicant, who received the file on January 13, 2021. \nDepartment Counsel submitted five items in support of the SOR allegations. \nItem 3 is inadmissible. It will not be considered or cited as evidence against Applicant\u2019s \ninterests in this case. It is the summary of unsworn interviews of Applicant conducted by \nan interviewer from the Office of Personnel Management on November 11, 2018, and \nJanuary 10, 2019. Applicant did not adopt them as his own statements, or otherwise \ncertify them to be accurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation \nsummary is inadmissible against Applicant\u2019s interests in the absence of an \nauthenticating witness. See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5. In light of Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, Item 3 is also cumulative. Applicant is not legally trained and may not have \nunderstood the import of Section V. \u201cNotice to Applicant\u201d in \u201cDepartment Counsel\u2019s File \nof Relevant Material (FORM).\u201d I therefor reviewed Item 3 for any potentially mitigating \ninformation that Applicant might have thought would be considered. No mitigating \ninformation was found in Item 3 that was not available from other sources in the record, \nand which was accordingly considered. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant elected not to submit \nany additional information. The case was assigned to me on March 16, 2021. Based \nupon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 58 and single. He has a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degrees. He is \nattempting to obtain national security eligibility in connection with his employment in the \ndefense industry.

It is noted that \nthe card was issued on February 16, 2017, and expired on February 15, 2018. There is \nno evidence that Applicant had a valid card at the time he filled out the e-QIP, or \nadmitted to last using marijuana, both of which events were in 2019. (Item 2 at Section \n23; Answer, Attachment 6.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had one delinquent tax debt and fourteen past-\ndue or charged-off commercial debts, totaling approximately $58,000. Support for the \nexistence and amount of the indebtedness is found in credit reports of the Government \ndated October 9, 2018; and November 19, 2020. (Items 4 and 5.) \nApplicant stated on his e-QIP that his debt problems occurred due to a loss of \nincome. He further stated, \u201cI have not had sufficient income to settle these debts yet but \nI have settled others.\u201d (Item 2 at Section 26.) \nThe current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: \n2.a. Applicant admitted owing the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for \ntax year 2006 in the amount of approximately $45,000. Applicant stated in his Answer \nthat he has reduced the indebtedness to $15,786. He stated in his Answer, \u201cWhen I \nstarted out as a contractor I found work only intermittently. I was not good at budgeting \nfor months out of work, keeping working capital, and saving for taxes. I learned to \nbudget for those things.\u201d This debt is not resolved. \n2.b. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $2,677 for a collection account. He has \nnot made any payments on this account and it remains due and owing. It is not \nresolved. \n2.c. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $1,582 for a past-due debt that has been \ncharged off. He stated in his Answer, \u201cThis debt is not on my credit report. I honestly \ndon\u2019t remember if I paid it. I could not find a receipt.\u201d While this debt is found in the 2019 \ncredit report (Government Exhibit 4), it is not found in the 2020 report (Government \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit 5).

(Answer, Attachment 3.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has a history of using illegal drugs. This occurred between 2017 and at \nleast January 2019. Applicant knew of the Government\u2019s concern over his drug use and \ncontinued his use anyway. There was no statement in his Answer that he would \ndiscontinue drug use. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant has stopped using illegal drugs, \nwith his admitted last use being as recent as two years ago. The medical marijuana \ncard he submitted with his Answer is out of date, and was out of date the last time he \nadmitted using marijuana in January 2019. Neither of the mitigating conditions apply. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:   \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant owed approximately $58,000 for delinquent tax debts, as well as past-\ndue and charged-off consumer debts, as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to this case. Applicant has paid off a \nsubstantial amount of his debt. However, he still owes approximately $15,000 in \ndelinquent taxes and $8,000 in past-due consumer debt. Applicant has had periods of \nunemployment over the past few years, but he submitted no evidence to show that he \nwas acting responsibly to pay his debts during subsequent periods of employment. He \ndid not submit any records showing that he has made any payments on the debts since \n2019. There is no evidence that he is making a current, good-faith effort to pay them. It \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis simply too soon to find that Applicant is financially stable. Paragraph 2 is found \nagainst Applicant. \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of drug use that \nwas not mitigated. In addition, he is substantially indebted. Insufficient time has passed, \nsince the last time he admitted to using drugs, to demonstrate rehabilitation or reduce \nthe likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence as described above leaves me \nwith questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guidelines for Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse, and Financial Conditions. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c and 2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e through 2.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.k through 2.m:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n10\n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Clearance is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 21, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). On June 14, 2020, \nApplicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and requesting a hearing. \nOn April 22, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of DCS video-teleconference hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for April 27, 2021. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel waived the requirement for 15-days of advance notice of the hearing. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I received three Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 3), \ntogether with the testimony of Applicant. Also, I received a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s \ndiscovery letter to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). At the close of the hearing, I left the record \nopen at Applicant\u2019s request to allow him the opportunity to submit exhibits. Within the time \nallotted, he submitted seven exhibits, which I incorporated into the record as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AE) A through AE G. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 10, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 63-year-old man with three adult children. He has been married to his \ncurrent spouse since April 2015. He was married previously from 1985 to 2014 to the \nmother of his children. (Tr. 31) That marriage ended in divorce. Applicant earned a \nbachelor\u2019s of science degree in 1985. (GE 2 at 2) He has been hired by a federal \ncontractor pending the outcome of the investigative process. (Tr. 16) Currently, he is \nmaking ends meet with financial help from his family members and through unemployment \nbenefits. (Tr. 69) \nApplicant and his former wife legally divorced in January 2014. Under a separation \nagreement, Applicant agreed to pay his ex-wife $5,000 per month in alimony and $500 per \nmonth in health insurance costs. (GE 3 at 55) The court calculated this support as a \npercentage of Applicant\u2019s annual salary, which had ranged from $200,000 to $290,000 \nover the years preceding the divorce. (Answer at 3; GE 3 at 258) Under the terms of the \nseparation agreement, the settlement could be amended for changed circumstances. (Tr. \n22) \nApplicant paid alimony, as ordered, for nearly two years after the divorce. (Tr. 22) \nThen, in November 2015, he lost his job. Consequently, he was unable to make the \nalimony payments. The day after Applicant lost his job, he retained an attorney, and filed a \nmotion to reconsider and modify the spousal maintenance order. (AE D) The hearing was \nscheduled for approximately June 2016. (Tr. 52) Although Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was \nsubpoenaed, she failed to appear. (Tr. 53; GE 3 at 11)) The court then dismissed the case. \nA few months later, Applicant re-filed the motion. His ex-wife was again subpoenaed, but \ndid not appear for the hearing. Rather than issue a default judgment, the court dismissed \nthe case. (Tr. 53) \nSubsequently, Applicant\u2019s attorney withdrew from the case. (AE E) Approximately \ntwo months later, in September 2016, Applicant retained another attorney. (Tr. 54) By then, \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was beginning to stress him financially, as his unemployment \nbenefits had ended approximately four months earlier. (GE 3 at 155) Consequently, he \ncould not afford to continue paying his new attorney, whereupon, she withdrew from the \ncase. \nWhile Applicant was unemployed, he discovered that he had not been withholding \nenough money to pay his federal income taxes, resulting in a $40,000 debt. (GE 3 at 155) \nShortly after Applicant\u2019s second attorney withdrew from the case, Applicant sold his home, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nused the profit to satisfy the income tax debt, and relocated to another state to live in his \nsister\u2019s home. (GE 1 at 9; GE 3 at 156) \nAfter relocating, Applicant continued to have difficulty finding a job, and remained \nunemployed for another four months. (GE 3 at 156) In February 2017, he obtained a job \nand relocated again. (GE 3 at 156) In September 2018, Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment. He has been either unemployed or underemployed since then, and has \nrelocated three more times. (GE 3 at 11, 156) \nApplicant made no spousal support payments for two years after losing his job in \nNovember 2015. This prompted his ex-wife\u2019s attorney to file a motion to enforce the \njudgment in late 2016. (GE 3 at 71) On January 23, 2017, the court entered a default \njudgment in favor of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife for delinquent spousal-support payments missed \nbetween November 2015 and January 2017, totaling $132,000. (GE 3 at 76) Applicant \nreceived a copy of the judgment, but did not make any payments towards it, prompting his \nex-wife in January 2019 to file a petition for enforcement and for breach of contract. (GE 3 \nat 76) Applicant was served with notice in March 2019. (GE 3 at 156) In June 2019, the \ncourt issued a default judgment in favor of Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, awarding her \u201c$457,675, \ntogether with post-judgment interest at a rate of 5% per annum until paid in full,\u201d and \n$228,837 in attorney fees. (Answer at 6; Tr. 21) \nIn February 2017, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law moved in with him and his spouse. \n(Answer at 4) Shortly thereafter, she had a heart attack. After spending nine months on life \nsupport, she died in November 2017. (Answer at 4) Pre-occupied with his mother-in-law\u2019s \ndeclining health and his frequent relocations while unemployed, Applicant failed to \u201clook in \non his ex-spouse\u2019s situation or what was happening in the courts.\u201d (Answer at 4) \nIn November 2019, Applicant retained an attorney to contest the judgment for \nsupport awarded his ex-wife. (Answer, Attachment F; GE 3 at 4) That month, Applicant\u2019s \nattorney informed Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s attorney that Applicant could not pay the judgment, \nand proposed paying a reduced amount of $100,000, in $1,400 increments for 71 months, \nto settle his support delinquency. (Answer, Attachment F at 2) Applicant talks with his \nattorney approximately once a month to discuss options for resolving the delinquency. (Tr. \n24) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s divorce attorney, the ex-wife\u2019s counsel told him that he \nwould consider the offer. As of June 2020, Applicant\u2019s divorce counsel had not received a \nresponse. (Answer, Attachment G) The parties have worked together to resolve other post-\ndivorce matters. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s attorney in December 2019 negotiated the division \nof one of Applicant\u2019s 401k accounts. \nApplicant is highly respected by his former coworkers and friends.

(GE 3 at 176-177; Tr. 20)  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds .  \nApplicant\u2019s outstanding judgment, entered against him for unpaid spousal support \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source . . . , and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant paid his spousal support, as ordered, for the first two years after his \ndivorce. He did not stop paying it until he lost his job and was unable to make payments. \nHe acted promptly, filing a motion to amend the court order to reflect his changed \ncircumstances. The court, however, never scheduled a hearing on Applicant\u2019s motion \nbecause his ex-wife repeatedly failed to appear. Subsequently, over the next three years, \nApplicant relocated four times in search of steady employment, and struggled to make \nends meet because of a lack of income. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems were incurred beyond his control. \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s problems gaining steady employment, he satisfied a \n$40,000 tax debt, which was not alleged in the SOR.  While his resolution of his tax debt is \nviewed favorably, Applicant made no effort to contact his wife after she obtained a default \njudgment against him in March 2017. In addition, he missed the hearing on his wife\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmotion to compel him to pay spousal maintenance. This hearing, in June 2019, resulted in \nthe judgment alleged in the SOR. Consequently, although circumstances beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control caused or contributed to his financial problems, he did not act \nresponsibly enough to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant retained an attorney in November 2019, five months before the issuance \nof the SOR. Since then, Applicant\u2019s attorney has been attempting to negotiate a plan to \npay a reduced, more affordable amount of delinquent spousal support. Applicant\u2019s attorney \nhas also been working with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s attorney to resolve other divorce\u2013related \nmatters such as the division of one of Applicant\u2019s retirement accounts. Applicant remains in \ntouch with his attorney, talking with him approximately once per month, to discuss \nresolution options. These good-faith efforts to resolve the outstanding judgment are \nsufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to applying the Guideline F adjudicative factors, I have considered the \nwhole-person factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Much of the litigation between Applicant and his \nex-wife appears to have been characterized by an extreme lack of communication. \nSpecifically, between June 2016 and January 2017, there was a motion to modify the \nspousal support order, to which Applicant\u2019s wife never responded, and a motion for \ncontempt filed by the ex-wife, pending at the same time. This lack of communication may \nhave been exacerbated by hostility not uncommon in such matters. Whatever the case, \nApplicant retained an attorney who has been working with his ex-wife\u2019s attorney to \nnegotiate a payment plan for the judgment, and to resolve other divorce-related issues. \nNotwithstanding the disruption to his life and the multiple relocations caused by his lengthy \nunemployment, Applicant could have certainly been more attentive to the ongoing litigation. \nGiven the cause of Applicant\u2019s cessation of spousal support payments, and the steps he is \ncurrently taking to resolve the outstanding judgment, I conclude the negative inference \ngenerated by the failure to pay the spousal support is sufficiently outweighed by the \nsurrounding circumstances to mitigate the security concern. \nIn reaching this decision, I considered the positive character references from his \nfriends, colleagues, and former coworkers. The evidence of good character provided by his \nformer coworkers leads me to conclude that Applicant is not likely to allow the debt to be a \nsource of undue financial coercion or pressure for him. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nFor A\n pplicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR also alleges his $115,334 mortgage \nwas at least 120 days delinquent in the amount of $2,299. \nApplicant provided three screen shots from his TransUnion Credit Report showing \n16 DOE/Nelnet student loans with status \u201con time\u201d and totaling $83,673 as follows: \n$10,674; $10,372; $9,986; $6,038; $5,785; $5,274; $5,101; $4,881; $4,506; $4,311; \n$3,336; $3,296; $3,187; $3,187; $3,132; and $607. (Tr. 34; AE F) In March 2019, his $676 \nfederal income tax refund and his $321 state income tax refund were diverted to address \nhis student loan debt.

(AE I) He made \nhis first $50 payment on April 7, 2021. (Id.) \nIn 2018, Applicant\u2019s mortgage became delinquent. (Tr. 31) His December 30, 2019 \ncredit report shows his last activity on his mortgage account was in October 2018. (Tr. \n31) He said it became delinquent because of his separation from his spouse. (Tr. 31) His \nMay 2020 mortgage statement shows his mortgage was current, and he had paid $7,303 \nin 2020 to the mortgage company. (Tr. 30; AE B) His December 2020 mortgage statement \nshows he made payments totaling $15,691 to address the mortgage, and escrow \npayments totaling $7,356 for taxes and insurance in 2020. (Id.) His monthly mortgage \nand escrow payment is $1,071. (Id.) His March 2021 mortgage statement shows a \nbalance owed on his mortgage of $110,095. (Id.) His mortgage is current. (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income after deductions is $1,750. (Tr. 31) His monthly \nmortgage payment is $1,071. (AE B) He does not have a car payment as he purchases \nused vehicles. (Tr. 37-38) He has about $300 available after paying his expenses. (Tr. \n32) His son is remote learning. Applicant is high risk because of the Corona Virus and \nworks at home.

His 2020 performance evaluation describes his exceptional \nproductivity and contributions to his employer. (AE C) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [public trust position].\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access to classified information \napplies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in \nChief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity or other sensitive information and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See Id. at 527. \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in \nthe Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her [access to sensitive information].\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation \nomitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise [sensitive] information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust position].  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of not timely paying his mortgage \nand student loan debts when due establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust \nposition], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \n[eligibility for a public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in [public trust position] \ndecisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. He was unemployed \nfor six months. He was unable to work outside his home because he was taking care of \nhis handicapped son. He was divorced. He is underemployed, and he lacks the income \nto pay all of his debts unless he obtains an income-driven repayment plan for his student \nloans. There is no evidence that he was aware of the existence of the income-driven \nrepayment plan for his student loans. These are circumstances beyond his control that \nadversely affected his finances. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in \nwhole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still \nconsider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with \nthose financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at \n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A \ncomponent is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant took reasonable actions to \nmaintain contact with his creditors, including making $5 monthly payments to his student-\nloan creditor. \nTwo Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) when an Applicant lacks the income to address debts. In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had $41,871 in delinquent credit card debt and \ndefaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at \n1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)\u201d even though that applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board \nalso decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. It is noteworthy that Applicant has the burden of proving the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition \nnever shifts to the Government. \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the \nability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted \u201cit will be a long time at best before \nhe has paid\u201d all of his creditors. Id. at 3. The applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \n \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.  \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 07-06482 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)). The applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 used his limited \nresources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment plan for the remaining \ndebts; and (3) took \u201creasonable actions to effectuate that plan.\u201d Id. The Appeal Board \nremanded the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision because it did not \u201carticulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for his conclusions,\u201d emphasizing the Administrative Judge did \u201cnot explain[] \nwhat he believes that applicant could or should have done under the circumstances that \nhe has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach taken \nby applicant was not \u2018responsible\u2019 in light of his limited circumstances.\u201d Id.   \n \nThe timing of the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts is a pertinent consideration. The \nAppeal Board has observed, \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having \nbeen placed on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness designations are in \njeopardy may be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). Applicant brought his mortgage to \ncurrent status before the SOR was issued. \nThe Appeal Board has explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts under AG \u00b6 20(d): \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith requires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant \nmust do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (citations, footnote, and last \nquotation marks omitted). \nAt the time of his hearing, it was evident that Applicant did not understand how to \nbring his student loans to current status. Taking into consideration the level of his \nknowledge about finances, particularly student loans, Applicant took reasonable and \nresponsible actions to resolve his debts, establishing his good faith. Based on Applicant\u2019s \ncredible and sincere promise to pay his debts and his track record of paying his debts, \nfuture new delinquent debt \u201cis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant\u2019s] \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) is warranted. Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation was damaged by circumstances partially or fully beyond his control. He acted \nresponsibly by paying as many debts as possible. Although there is limited evidence of \nrecord that he established and maintained contact with his creditors, his financial problem \nis being resolved and is under control. Applicant will conscientiously endeavor to maintain \nhis financial responsibility, and he will establish a student loan payment plan and bring \nhis student loans to current status. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a trustworthiness concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). The Appeal Board indicated: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. Additionally, the Appeal Board gives \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019). \nThe SOR alleges Applicant \u201cfalsified material facts\u201d in his November 19, 2018 SCA \nwhen he failed to disclose his delinquent mortgage and student loans in collections. This \nmeans the Government alleged Applicant \u201cfalsely created or altered in order to deceive.\u201d \nMerriam Webster Dictionary, available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ \nfalsified. Applicant admitted that he erred when he failed to disclose his delinquent student \nloan debts on his SCA. His rationale for not disclosing these delinquent debts was his \nreliance on a summary credit report, Credit Karma. Before completing his SCA, he \nchecked Credit Karma for reportable financial information. There was no mention of his \nmortgage or student loans. Applicant is unsophisticated in financial matters. \nApplicant\u2019s November 19, 2018 SCA asked whether in the previous seven years \nApplicant had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency, or whether he had any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. \nIt is noteworthy, that Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit report does not indicate that DOE turned his \nstudent loans over to a collection agency. Evidently, DOE retained his student loans and \nclassified them as being in collections. It is unclear whether DOE engages in collection \nactivity. His credit report only put one medical account in the collections part of the report, \nand Applicant disclosed that debt on his SCA. \nThere were no instances of inconsistent statements that damaged his credibility, \nexcept for his failure to disclose his student loans on his SCA. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02181 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2019); ISCR Case No. 14-02567 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, \n2015); ISCR Case No. 10-09035 at 6-7 (App. Bd. June 10, 2014). He explained why he \ndid not disclose this negative financial information. I find Applicant\u2019s denial of intent to \ndeceive the Government about his debts to be credible. Personal conduct trustworthiness \nconcerns are refuted. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines E and F are incorporated in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old health service information technology specialist \nemployed by the same defense contractor since December 2018. In 2013, he received \nan associate\u2019s degree in business administration. In April 2019, he was divorced. His \nfinances were harmed by his divorce, underemployment, unemployment, and his son\u2019s \nmedical issues. Nevertheless, he acted responsibly by bringing his mortgage to current \nstatus. He owes about $83,000 in student loans which are current due to the CARES Act. \nHe has a history of delinquent student loans due to lack of income; however, there is a \nmechanism for maintaining his student loans in current status, that is, the \u201cincome-driven \nrepayment plan.\u201d It would take 20 years, but he would be able to resolve his student loans. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nrefuted the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline E, and he mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

On May 18, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on a date uncertain. (Government \nExhibit 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the \nwritten record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nDecember 18, 2020. \nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining five Items was received by Applicant on January 12, 2021. He was afforded \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted a three-page \nresponse to the FORM within the 30-day period. Applicant\u2019s response was admitted \n1 \n\n \ninto the record without objection. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 19, \n2021. Hereinafter, all reference to Government Items will be referenced as Government \nExhibits. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 35 years old, and divorced. He has one child who is two years old. \nHe has a high school diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor in a Shipboard \nTemporary Services position. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR identified nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $38,557, \nshowing a history of financial problems. Applicant admits each of the allegations set \nforth in the SOR under this guideline except 1.c. Credit reports of the Applicant dated \nAugust 3, 2019; and December 10, 2020, confirm the outstanding debts. (Government \nExhibits 4 and 5.) Applicant began working for his current employer in February 2005. \nApplicant was married from September 2013 until his divorce in June 2015. He \nincurred debt that he has not paid. In regard to three debts specifically: 1.d, in the \namount of $5,015; 1.f. in the amount of $2,586; and 1.i. in the amount of $613, Applicant \nbelieves that he and his ex-spouse are responsible to pay them. He states that he is \nseeking legal action in order to find her and try and settle those debts. He attributes his \ndivorce and his medical problems to his indebtedness.  \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant states that he is currently working on his \ndelinquent debt with the help of a credit consultant. He has a fianc\u00e9 and they hope to \npurchase a house within the next two years. He and his fianc\u00e9 are living together, \nrenting a house, she helps pay household bills, and is helping him work on his monthly \nbudget. \nThe following delinquent debts remains owing: \n1.a. A delinquent auto loan was placed for collection in the approximate amount \nof $29,160. Applicant states that he currently owns the vehicle and has reached a \nsettlement agreement with the creditor totaling $8,000. \nApplicant states that the \npayment plan requires him to pay $1,236 monthly for six months. So far, Applicant had \nmade the first good-faith payment of $580.46. When the last payment is made, he will \nreceive the title to the vehicle. Applicant provided a copy of the settlement offer. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \n2 \n\n \n \n1.b. \nA delinquent cellular phone debt was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $513. There is nothing in the record to show that this debt has \nbeen resolved.  The debt remains owing. \n1.c. A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$533. Applicant denied this debt. He states that it was opened in error on line and he is \ndisputing it. There is nothing in the record to substantiate his dispute. The debt \nappears delinquent on his most recent credit report. There is nothing in the record to \nshow that this debt has been resolved.  The debt remains owing. \n1.d. A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$5,015. Applicant believes this is a joint-debt with his ex-spouse and he states that he is \ncurrently seeking legal action to find her and serve her with papers. Applicant also \nstates that he has reached out to the creditor but has not received a response. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) There is nothing in the record to show that his \ndebt has been resolved.  This debt remains owing. \n1.e. A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$60. Applicant claims that he is in contact with the creditor but due to the Covid virus \ncorrespondence has been delayed. There is nothing in the record to show that this debt \nhas been resolved.  The debt remains owing. \n1.f. A delinquent debt owed to a jewelry store was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $2,586. Applicant believes this is a joint-debt with his ex-\nspouse and he states that he is currently seeking legal action to find her and serve her \nwith papers. He further states that he is working on making a payment arrangement \nwith the creditor. (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) There is nothing in the record \nto show that this debt has been resolved.  The debt remains owing. \n1.g. A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $52. \nApplicant admits that the account is delinquent and that he owes the \ndebt. He also states that he paid the debt but has not received documentation to \nsubstantiate his payment, as the creditor is behind in this processing. There is nothing \nin the record to show that this debt has been resolved.  The debt remains owing. \n1.h. A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $25. There is nothing in the record to show that this debt has been resolved. \nThe debt remains owing. \n1.i. A delinquent credit card account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $613.  Applicant believes this is a joint-debt with his ex-spouse and he states \nthat he is currently seeking legal action to find her and serve her with papers. He states \nthat he is also currently working on a settlement plan. There is nothing in the record to \nshow that this debt has been resolved.  The debt remains owing. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts that he could not pay. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each one of them set forth below: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \n5 \n\nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant expresses a willingness to pay off his delinquent debt, but has not \nprovided documentation that he has done so. Except for one debt in the SOR that \nApplicant has settled and made a first good-faith payment toward, Applicant has not \ndone anything more to address his delinquent debts. There is no evidence in the record \nto show that he has made any of the monthly payments required to follow through with \nthe settlement agreements. All of the other debts set forth in the SOR remain owing. In \nfact, even debts as small as $25, $52, and $60 have not been paid. This does not show \ngood judgment or a good faith effort. Applicant claims that he is working with a credit \nconsultant but has provided no evidence to show financial progress. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that his financial problems have been resolved, or are being resolved, or \nthat they are unlikely to recur. The mitigating conditions do not apply. Accordingly, this \nguideline is found for against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has not sufficiently addressed his \n6 \n\n \n \n \ndebts or made a good faith effort to resolve them. He claims that he incurred the debt \nbecause of his divorce. In May 2020, when he answered the SOR, he stated that he \nwas at that time setting up payment plans with his creditors. Since then, nothing of the \nsort has been accomplished. Furthermore, the largest of his debts is the automobile \nloan which he incurred three years after the divorce. This more likely shows that \nApplicant has lived beyond his means during his earlier marriage and following his \ndivorce. Applicant remains excessively indebted. At this time, he has not demonstrated \nthat he can be trusted with the national secrets. This is not an individual with whom the \nGovernment can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations, \nand do the right thing, even when no one is looking. He is not qualified for access to \nclassified information, nor is it clear that the information will be properly protected. \nApplicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

On October 21, 2020, Applicant signed a Statement of Intent \neschewing future illegal drug usage. (AppX A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana on numerous occasions. He also used it on about four \noccasions after being granted a security clearance. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) \nare established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nAlthough Applicant now avers he intends to abstain from all future drug \ninvolvement, it is troubling that he used marihuana after being alerted to the \nGovernment\u2019s concern in 2012, and after being granted a security clearance in 2012. \nHe refers to his more recent usage being \u201cyoung and immature,\u201d but it strikes the \nundersigned as being more of a pattern of not being trustworthy. Applicant was in his \nmid to late 20s during this last period of usage, not an immature teenager. Although he \nself-reported his usage in his e-QIPs; and is to be commended for his honesty, it must \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbe noted that Applicant\u2019s last usage was as recent as 2018. Drug Involvement is found \nagainst Applicant.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is clearly well respected in \nthe workplace (AppX E.) He does his job well. (AppXs B~D.) However, overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked since January 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1996 until he retired with an honorable discharge as a chief warrant officer-3 in 2018. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which he earned in 2015, and post-graduate credits towards a master\u2019s degree. He is married with two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24-26; GE 1) Applicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and criminal charges for passing bad checks. In 1998, he was charged with the misdemeanor offense of fraud \u2013 insufficient funds check. He pleaded guilty in 1999 in a deferred adjudication. He was fined $200. In February 2015, he was arrested and charged with the misdemeanor offense of theft of property less than $500 by check. The date of the offense was reported to be in October 2014. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7) Applicant stated that he was solicited by a door-to-door salesman for a local newspaper. He wrote a check for $25 and gave it to the salesman. His wife then gave Applicant $25 in cash, which Applicant gave to the salesman. He asked the salesman to rip up the check. The salesman ripped something up in front of him, but it was not the check.

He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1996 until \nhe retired with an honorable discharge as a chief warrant officer-3 in 2018. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, which he earned in 2015, and post-graduate credits towards a \nmaster\u2019s degree. He is married with two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24-26; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \ncriminal charges for passing bad checks. In 1998, he was charged with the \nmisdemeanor offense of fraud \u2013 insufficient funds check. He pleaded guilty in 1999 in a \ndeferred adjudication. He was fined $200. In February 2015, he was arrested and \ncharged with the misdemeanor offense of theft of property less than $500 by check. The \ndate of the offense was reported to be in October 2014. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 7) \n \nApplicant stated that he was solicited by a door-to-door salesman for a local \nnewspaper. He wrote a check for $25 and gave it to the salesman. His wife then gave \nApplicant $25 in cash, which Applicant gave to the salesman. He asked the salesman to \nrip up the check. The salesman ripped something up in front of him, but it was not the \ncheck. Applicant stopped payment on the check \u201cto be safe.\u201d He was unaware the \nnewspaper attempted to cash the check until he was stopped for a minor traffic offense, \nand the warrant was discovered. The charge was dismissed two days later. (Tr. at 55-\n57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7) \nApplicant was stopped for a traffic violation in September 2016. He was arrested \nwhen it was discovered that he had two warrants from 2000 for passing bogus checks. \nIn October 2017, he pleaded guilty to the two charges in a deferred judgment. He was \nordered to pay $50 in fines, plus court costs, and $10 in restitution for the two offenses. \nIn October 2019, the court determined that all of the conditions of the deferred judgment \nwere satisfied. The charges were dismissed, and the record expunged. (Tr. at 56; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6, 7) \nIn October 2008, the then U.S. Army Central Personnel Security Clearance \nFacility (CCF) notified Applicant that it intended to revoke his security clearance based \non his finances (delinquent debts) and personal conduct (not reporting his delinquent \ndebts on his security clearance application). His security clearance was suspended \npending adjudication. After considering Applicant\u2019s November 2008 response, the CCF \ngranted Applicant\u2019s security clearance in May 2009, with the warning that \u201csubsequent \nunfavorable information may result in the suspension of your clearance.\u201d There is no \nevidence that Applicant was informed that his security clearance was suspended or that \nhe received a copy of the warning notice.1 (GE 8) \n1 These matters were not alleged in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. They may \nbe considered for the purpose of placing Applicant on notice of the importance of maintaining his finances \nin order and of providing accurate information on a security clearance application. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe delinquent debts in the current SOR were based on credit reports obtained \nin October 2016, June 2019, and Match 2020. Applicant attributed his financial \nproblems to prioritizing his military service over his finances. He deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and he served in the Republic of Korea. He estimated that he was away \nfrom home about 12 of the 22 years he served in the military. There were separations \nfrom his family where he had to maintain two households. His wife had a medical \ncondition that prevented her from working. His wife handled the majority of the family\u2019s \nfinances, and he was not always aware of the status of their finances. He contracted \nwith a debt-resolution company in June 2019 to assist him in disputing inaccurate items \non his credit report. (Tr. at 20-22, 34-36, 60-61; GE 1, 3-5; AE G) \nApplicant and his wife borrowed about $35,470 from a financial institution in May \n2015 to finance a used 2013 sport utility vehicle (SUV) with about 15,000 miles. The \npayments were $759 per month for 72 months. He stated that he bought a 100,000 mile \nextended warranty from the dealer. The SUV had problems with the transmission in \nabout July 2017. The dealer told him that the problems were not covered by the \nwarranty, and the repairs would cost about $2,200. Applicant believes that the warranty \nshould have covered the repairs. He decided not to repair the SUV and contacted the \nfinance company to repossess it. (Tr. at 27-31, 33-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n3-5) \nApplicant stated that $12,539 remained on the auto loan when they stopped \nmaking payments. The October 2016 credit report lists the account as $1,879 past due, \nwith a balance of $33,097. The June 2019 and March 2020 credit reports list the \naccount as $28,944 past due, with the same amount as the balance. The September \n2020 credit report lists the account as charged off with a balance of $12,539. The \namount is almost assuredly the deficiency balance on the loan after the SUV was sold \nby the finance company, and not what remained on the account when they stopped \nmaking payments. Applicant stated that he was never contacted by the finance \ncompany about any balance due. The credit-repair company is disputing the debt. (Tr. \nat 28, 31-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges $12,272 owed to a financial institution that specializes in loans \nto military members. The October 2016 credit report lists the account as opened in \nAugust 2015 with $287 payments per month for 36 months. The high credit was $6,770. \nThe account was reported as charged off for $6,100, with a balance of the same \namount. The date of last action was March 2016. The June 2019 credit report lists the \naccount as $12,272 past due, with the same amount as the balance. The credit-repair \ncompany disputed the debt, and it does not appear on the March 2020 credit report. (Tr. \nat 32-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) \nApplicant stated that he paid the loan until the financial institution raised the \ninterest rate in violation of their contract. He admitted that he borrowed about $6,100 or \n$6,700, but he believes he owed $2,272 when he stopped paying the loan. That figure \ndoes not add up when the amount borrowed (at least $6,100 in August 2015), the \namount of the monthly payments ($278), and the date the payments stopped (March \n2016) are all factored in. I find the most accurate amount to be $6,100, which is what he \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nowed in September 2016 when the loan was charged off. (Tr. at 32, 37-46; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $7,266 charged-off auto loan owed to the same financial \ninstitution that provided the charged-off auto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant \nessentially denied owing the debt, stating it was consolidated into the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt. \nThe credit-repair company disputed the debt. The October 2016 credit report lists the \naccount as a separate auto loan that was opened in August 2015, with a high credit of \n$15,341 and a balance of $14,627. The loan was current as of that credit report. The \nJune 2019 credit report lists the charged-off account as $7,266 past due, with the same \namount as the balance. The March and September 2020 credit reports list the account \nas charged off with a past-due amount and balance of $7,175. I conclude that the loans \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are two separate auto loans; Applicant is responsible for \nboth; and he has not paid either. (Tr. at 52-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) \nApplicant denied owing the $870 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $686 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) debts owed \nto the same bank. He stated that the credit-repair company was able to remove the \ndebts from his credit report. Applicant did not provide the basis of the dispute. The debts \nare listed on the October 2016 and June 2019 credit reports as becoming delinquent in \n2012 and 2013 and charged off in 2013. The debts are not reported on any subsequent \ncredit report. The debts are past the seven-year reporting window, so they should not \nbe listed on the later reports regardless of whether they were disputed. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $738 delinquent debt owed to a financial institution, but that \namount appears to be based on a misreading of the credit reports. The October 2016 \ncredit report lists the account as current with a balance of $490. The two more recent \ncredit reports list the account as $738 and $797 past due, with a balance of $490. I \nconsider $490 to be the correct amount that was owed. Applicant stated that he settled \nthe debt over the phone for $350 in December 2020, but he did not have a receipt. \nPost-hearing, he submitted proof that he paid $490 to the creditor on July 23, 2021. (Tr. \nat 46-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B) \n \nApplicant initially stated that he did not consider the $467 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.g to be valid, and the credit-repair company was disputing the debt. The debt became \ndelinquent in about September 2014. He paid the debt in full in July 2021. (Tr. at 48-49, \n51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a $460 delinquent debt for an apartment lease. Applicant \nstated that he exercised the military clause in the contract to end the lease early, and \nthat he paid the last month\u2019s rent in about November 2017. He stated that he \nnonetheless decided to accept a settlement of the debt for $230, which he paid in \nDecember 2020. Applicant stated that he did not have a receipt. Post-hearing, he \nsubmitted proof that he paid $345 to the creditor on July 1, 2021.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the 2016 SF 86. \nSome of his statements are a bit difficult to accept, particularly since he went through \nsimilar events in 2008. I am left with two choices: Applicant is either a liar or the \ndiscrepancies on the SF 86 resulted from a gross disregard for his finances. In light of \nhis many years of honorable service, I accept the latter. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are concluded for Applicant. The gross disregard \nfor his finances will be addressed below. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes multiple delinquent debts and bad \ncheck offenses, is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. I \nbelieve the bad check offenses resulted from negligence, not from an intentional \nfinancial breach of trust such as fraud. AG \u00b6 19(d) is not applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to prioritizing his military service, \nincluding multiple deployments, over his finances. There were separations from his \nfamily where he had to maintain two households. His wife had a medical condition that \nprevented her from working. His wife handled the majority of the family\u2019s finances, and \nhe was not always aware of the status of their finances. Those events would provide \nmore mitigation had Applicant done more to resolve his debts and if he had not been \nthrough this before. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that he settled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h in \nDecember 2020. Post-hearing, he established that he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, \nand 1.h, but not until after the hearing in July 2021. Those debts are mitigated. The \n$151 debt to a cable provider (SOR \u00b6 1.i) from 2012 is also mitigated. The bad checks \nhave been resolved. Those allegations are also mitigated. \nI am satisfied that the remaining debts, even if they no longer appear on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, are his debts, and they are not paid. There is insufficient \nevidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a \nreasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues \nare recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence and years of honorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude personal conduct \nsecurity concerns were not established, but Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She has not yet made \na payment arrangement with the IRS to address her indebtedness.

(Exhibit 2) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP.

(Exhibits 3 and 4) Thereafter, on October 15, 2020, after \nreviewing the available information, the DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR several months later in April 2021 in a two-page \nmemorandum.1 She denied the first allegation, explaining that she believed she had \ntimely filed her federal income tax return for 2103, but it was not because of an error \nmade by the firm she hired to prepare her income tax returns. She stated that she \ndiscovered the error in about 2019, and she filed the return in about October 2020. She \nalso denied the second allegation, explaining that she believed she owed the sum of \n$9,730, not the $15,051 alleged, in back taxes to the IRS for tax years 2011, 2012, \n2015, 2016, and 2017.2 She did not provide supporting documentation. She stated that \nshe wished to have an administrative judge issue a decision based on the written record \nin lieu of a hearing. \nOn June 29, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it August 24 2021. \nShe did not reply to the FORM.

As I understand and construe her answer to the SOR, \nApplicant does not dispute or contest the central point of the SOR allegations, but \ninstead contends her tax situation is less serious than alleged. \nApplicant disclosed her income-tax problems when she completed her 2017 \nsecurity clearance application. (Exhibit 2 at Section 26) She provided additional \ninformation about her income-tax problems during her 2019 background investigation \nand in response to written interrogatories in 2020. (Exhibits 3 and 4) Of note, her \nresponse to the interrogatories included supporting documentation, such as IRS \nAccount Transcripts for multiple tax years. I will rely on the transcripts because I have \nfound them to be easy to understand, reliable, and the best evidence. \nIn addition to the IRS Account Transcripts, Applicant presented information \nshowing she had filed state income tax returns and paid taxes due in her states of \nresidence. (Exhibits 3 and 4) \nApplicant\u2019s financial history includes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2014. \n(Exhibit 5) The Schedule E in the bankruptcy records reflects she then owed $8,866 in \nback taxes to the IRS for tax year 2011, and $2,891 for tax year 2012. \nFor tax year 2007, the IRS Account Transcript, as of January 2020, showed \nApplicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $0; and taxable income of \n$21,375. (Exhibit 3) \nFor tax year 2009, the IRS Account Transcript, as of January 2020, showed \nApplicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $0; and taxable income of \n$58,249. (Exhibit 3) \nFor tax year 2011, the IRS Account Transcript, as of February 2020, showed \nApplicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $8,072; and taxable \nincome of $50,299. (Exhibit 4) \nFor tax year 2013, the IRS Account Transcript, showed Applicant filing as head \nof household; an account balance of -$200; and the income information was not \nreported because the tax return had not been filed. (Exhibits 3 and 4) As stated in her \nanswer to the SOR, she explained that she believed she had timely filed her federal \nincome tax return for 2103, but it was not because of an error made by the firm she \nhired to prepare her income tax returns. She stated that she discovered the error in \nabout 2019, and she filed the return in about October 2020. \nFor tax year 2014, the IRS Account Transcript, as of February 2020, showed \nApplicant filing as head of household; an account balance of $0; and taxable income of \n$25,643.

Including the $2,891 in back taxes for 2012, which are reflected in the \nbankruptcy records, the total is approximately $13,636 for the five tax years in question. \nPer the IRS Account Statement for 2011, the IRS determined the balance due on \nApplicant\u2019s account was currently not collectible in October 2019. (Exhibits 3 and 4). As \nI understand IRS practice and procedure, a currently not collectible status protects a \ntaxpayer from the IRS, stopping levies, threatening letters, and collection. It\u2019s like \n\u201cputting a debt on the shelve\u201d because the IRS takes the case out of their active \ncollection inventory (shelving it); it is not a forgiveness or cancellation of debt. In \naddition, the IRS is free to return a case to their active collection inventory if the \ntaxpayer\u2019s situation changes. \nApplicant stated in her answer to the SOR that she has made payments to the \nIRS, corresponded with the IRS, and even submitted a payment plan form to which she \nhad not received a reply from the IRS. A review of the IRS Account Transcripts shows \nthat she has made sporadic or irregular payments over the years, her most recent \npayment was made in October 2018, that she had installment agreements established \nbut they did not last, and that she received penalties for dishonored payments. To date, \nshe does not have an installment agreement established or pending with the IRS so far \nas I can determine. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.3 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d4 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.5 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.6 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.7 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.8 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n3  Department of the Navy v.

The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \nApplicant is now in partial compliance with the IRS, which means that she filed all \ntax returns, as required. Her proof of filing for tax year 2013 is not documented here, but \nI am nonetheless persuaded that she filed the 2013 federal income tax return in about \nOctober 2020, as stated in her answer to the SOR. I was also persuaded by her \nexplanation that the untimely filing was the result of an error made by the tax accounting \nfirm. Her explanation was reasonable given that she otherwise timely filed tax returns. \nOn this basis, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a is decided for Applicant. \nConcerning her indebtedness to the IRS, Applicant owes more than $13,000 in \nback taxes, interest, and penalties to the IRS. She presented no documentation \nshowing that she is working to establish an arrangement with the IRS to resolve the \nindebtedness. It is further noted that her past efforts with installment agreements with \nthe IRS were unsuccessful. Although her account with the IRS has been in a currently \nnot collectible status since late 2019, that status does not prevent or prohibit her from \npaying what she owes. And it does not mean her years of nonpayment of back taxes \ncannot be considered here. \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \nTo her credit, Applicant disclosed her income-tax problems in her 2017 security \nclearance application, and she provided additional information during the security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence\nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable\nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she\nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance process. But her remedial efforts fall short of the mark. This is shown by her \nsporadic or irregular payment history, and her last payment to the IRS about three years \nago in October 2018. Furthermore, she has not yet made a payment arrangement with \nthe IRS. It is also too soon to tell if she will succeed in making a payment arrangement \nwith the IRS and then comply with that arrangement. The evidence as a whole is not \nsufficient to justify complete mitigation of her long-standing history of income-tax \nproblems. On this basis, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b is decided against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

After his \nlast phone infraction in October 2019, Applicant again modified his behavior and started \nto connect his phone to its charger and to leave it in the green office on top of his desk. \nHe has not incurred any additional phone infractions after October 2019. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.d, alleging that he improperly marked classified \ndocuments and received a security infraction in March 2018. (Two identical pages were \nmarked differently, and a third page was unmarked.) He also denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nalleging that he failed to properly secure a classified document in March 2018. \n(Classified documents were found in multiple places in his cubicle.) (GE 3) \nApplicant explained that he shared a cubicle with another employee. The cubicle \nhad two computer desks with their respective overhead bins. The computers and the \narea were also used by other company employees passing through. Applicant claimed \none of the computers and overhead bin as his area, kept it clean, and maintained it \norganized. He did not manage or clean the other cubicle used by a fellow employee. \nIn March 2018, a company internal audit discovered unattended classified \ndocuments and mismarked classified documents in the bin adjacent to Applicant\u2019s \nclaimed area. According to the company records, the computer and bin area where the \nunattended and mismarked classified documents were found had been assigned to him. \nApplicant testified that neither he nor his co-worker knew they had been assigned a \nparticular computer and bin area. After taking responsibility for the security infractions, \nApplicant assumed control of his assigned area and cleaned and organized it. He \ndenied mismarking the document or improperly storing the classified document in the \nbin. (Tr. 31-35) \nAn incident report states that \u201cthere was no known compromise of classified \ninformation because the incident was within a secure facility, but open storage is not \nallowed\u201d. (GE 9) Applicant accumulated more than four security infractions within a 12-\nmonth period, and according to company policy, such behavior established a reportable \nsecurity violation. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \nApplicant has done well with his company. He testified that he has always \nreceived top ratings in his performance evaluations. (Tr. 20-21) His supervisor \nconsiders him to be a valued team member, a trusted employee, and the go-to person \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor several company projects.

(AE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s company information systems security officer (ISSO) submitted a \nstrong letter endorsing his eligibility for a clearance. (AE 4) He has interacted with \nApplicant for the last two years. In his opinion, Applicant has demonstrated honesty, \ntrustworthiness, and his ability to follow rules. He believes that Applicant displays a \npositive attitude and a strong work ethic. He believes that Applicant voluntarily disclosed \nall of his accidental infractions because he is honest and follows the rules. He \nhighlighted that Applicant was counseled and he changed his habits. As of the date of \nhis letter in June 2021, Applicant had not had any recent infractions. \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) and industrial security manager also \nsubmitted a letter endorsing his eligibility for a clearance. (AE 5) The FSO previously \nheld the position of ISSO, and was aware of Applicant\u2019s security infractions. The FSO \nnoted that Applicant always self-reported his security infractions and notified the \nsecurity team of his mistakes. He believes Applicant understands the rules and is willing \nto hold himself accountable. The FSO believes Applicant is one of the most honest \npeople he has ever encountered. He recommends Applicant for a clearance without \nhesitation. \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his security infractions and violation. He \nbelieves that he voluntarily reported his infractions because of the training he has \nreceived since 2015, and the annual security training refresher courses. (Ge 6) He \nbelieves that he now has a system in place that has been working since October 2019, \nto make sure that he does not have any future infractions. He promised to do his best to \navoid any future infractions. He is concerned with the security of the United States and \nwould never do anything to jeopardize national security. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nUnder AG \u00b6 33 the security concern is that: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information - raises \ndoubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity clearance cases require administrative judges to assess whether an \napplicant has the requisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to be \nentrusted with classified information. \nApplicant inadvertently entered a secured (prohibited) area with his phone in \nApril, July, and October 2017, and received three security infractions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 c). \nHe received a security infraction for improperly marking classified documents (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d), and another for failure to store classified documents in an approved container in \nMarch 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He received a security violation for accumulating more than \nfour security infractions in a 12-month period in March 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He \ninadvertently entered a secured area with his phone in July and October 2019, and \nreceived two security infractions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and h). \nApplicant\u2019s violations of security rules and procedures raise the following \nGuideline K security concern under AG \u00b6 34: \n(g): any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information. \nThe conditions that could mitigate the security concerns under AG \u00b6 35 include: \n(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and \n(d): the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed all of his phone security infractions immediately to \nhis FSO and surrendered his phone for inspection. A review of the phone revealed no \nclassified or sensitive information on the phone. The security personnel considered the \ncompromise of classified information \u201cpossible, but not probable.\u201d After each incident, \nApplicant was retrained about the prohibition of bringing cell phones into secured areas. \nAdditionally, he has participated in annual refresher security training since 2015.  \nAfter the first three security infractions, Applicant developed practical measures \nto prevent him from bringing the phone into the secured area (leaving the phone in his \ncar). His method worked until he started bringing the phone with him to the office to \ncommunicate with his wife. After the two 2019 phone security infractions, Applicant \nmodified his behavior and started to leave his cell phone in his office plugged to its \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharging station. The new system has worked for him. He has not had any additional \nphone security infractions after October 2019. Considering Applicant\u2019s testimony, his \nsecurity retraining, his positive attitude toward following rules and procedures, and the \nstatements of his supervisor and two company security officials, I believe that the \nsecurity infraction violations occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur. \nConcerning his security infractions for improperly marking classified documents \nand for his failure to store classified documents in an approved container, there is no \nevidence of any similar security violations after 2018. Although Applicant claimed \nsomeone else left the documents in his office area, he took responsibility for the \ninfractions, cleaned the office area, and organized it to prevent any additional \ninfractions. He acknowledged his mistakes and has learned from them. I find the \ninfractions occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, and he participated in \nremedial training and certifications. Applicant is now more aware and cognizant of his \nresponsibility to protect classified information. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s violations happened \nunder such circumstances that are unlikely to recur and are mitigated by the passage of \ntime. His reference statements and his performance evaluation report show that he \nestablished a strong reputation for following and complying with security rules and \nregulations. He established a positive attitude toward the discharge of his security \nresponsibilities. There is documentary evidence of yearly security training up until 2021 \nto prevent such security infractions in the future. I find that his past security infractions \ndo not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n35(a), (b), and (d) apply. The evidence is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his handling of protected information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline K in \nmy whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 64, has been working for federal contractors since 1997, and for his \ncurrent employer and clearance sponsor since 2007. He was granted clearance \neligibility in 2015. \nApplicant\u2019s references attested to his professionalism, skills, knowledge, \nleadership, and noted that he is considered an exceptional employee. Both the ISSO \nand the FSO noted that Applicant always self-reported his security infractions and \nnotified the security team of his mistakes. They believe Applicant understand the rules \nand is willing to hold himself accountable. They both consider Applicant as one of the \nmost honest people they have ever encountered.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred 11 delinquent debts of approximately $45,000, some of which \nrelate back to 2014. He failed to document payment of any of the debts. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are recent and \nall remain unresolved.

While Applicant dealt with financial conditions beyond his \ncontrol (a divorce in 2017), I find he has not acted responsibly in trying to resolve his \ndebts. He failed to document any efforts by him to negotiate payment plans, or payments \nto his creditors. Consequently, he has failed to establish a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. There is no evidence Applicant used a financial counselor. He failed to \nsupport his debt disputes concerning his ex-wife with any documentation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, including his divorce in 2017. \nNevertheless, Applicant has not established a track record of financial stability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admission is incorporated as a finding of fact. After a review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in October 2014. He attended a service academy from 2002 to 2006, \nwhere he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree and was commissioned as a second \nlieutenant in the U.S. Army. He served in the Army as a Captain until he submitted a \nresignation for the good of the service in lieu of facing charges referred against him at a \ngeneral court-martial. His resignation was accepted by the Secretary of the Army and \nhe was discharged with an \u201cunder other than honorable conditions\u201d discharge on April 5, \n2011. He is married, but has no children. (Tr. at 6, 28, 31-32, 46; GE 1; 6, 8) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was discharged from the Army in 2011, with an \nother than honorable discharge, in lieu of trial by court-martial on the referred charges of \nviolations of Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 121 (larceny of property \nvalued at $12,000) and Article 132 (filing a fraudulent claim in excess of $12,000 in May \n2010). The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his answers when completing his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) in November 2017 when he failed to disclose in \nSection 13A that his separation from the Army was based upon charges or allegations \nof misconduct (i.e., committing larceny and submitting a false claim contrary to UCMJ \nArticles 121 and 132); and in Section 22 when he failed to disclose that he was \ncharged under the UCMJ with the offenses of larceny and filing a false claim (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.c). \nIn April 2010, Applicant received permanent change of station (PCS) orders to \nrelocate to a new duty station. To move his household goods to his new location, he \nchose the do-it-yourself (DITY) move option. This option allows a service member to \nmove his household goods himself and then be reimbursed by the government for the \nmove expenses and for the weight of the goods transported up to a certain limit based \nupon rank and family size. On March 30, 2010, Applicant attended a mandatory briefing \nabout conducting a DITY move that covered such things as what items were not \nallowable to claim for a DITY move. He also received a checklist of allowable and non-\nallowable DITY move items. Building material, such as bags of concrete or cement mix, \nare disallowed for DITY moves.

A UCMJ Article 32 hearing was held in approximately August 2010, \nwhich resulted in a referral of the charges to a general court-martial by the convening \nauthority. In January 2011, Applicant voluntarily tendered his resignation from the Army \nfor the good of the service in lieu of trial by court-martial. The command recommended \napproval of the resignation for the good of the service with the issuance of an under \nother than honorable discharge. The Secretary of Army approved the recommendation \nwith an under than honorable discharge. Applicant was separated from the Army on \nApril 5, 2011, with an under other than honorable discharge. He has filed four \napplications with the Army Discharge Review Board (DRB) (November 2012, July 2015, \nAugust 2017, and June 2019) seeking an upgrade of his discharge. The first three were \ndenied with no relief granted, and the fourth remains unaddressed. (Tr. 26, 56-58; GE 6-\n13) \n \n \nOn November 29, 2017, Applicant completed and cerified as true and accurate \nhis SCA. Section 13A of the SCA asked Applicant if any of the following happened in \nthe last seven years concerning his employment activities (it is less than seven-years \nbetween Applicant\u2019s completed SCA and April 5, 2011, Applicant\u2019s date of discharge): \n1) been fired from a job; 2) quit after being told you would be fired; 3) left a job by \nmutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; and 4) left a job by \nmutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. Applicant answered \n\u201cno\u201d to this question. Section 22 of the SCA asked, inter alia, have you ever been \ncharged with any felony offense, including those under the UCMJ and nonmilitary felony \noffenses. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this question.

He loaded the bags onto the trailer he would be using for his DITY move. He \npurchased the concrete mix for the sole purpose of increasing his household goods \nweight so that he would receive a larger reimbursement from the government after he \nfiled his DITY-move claim. He contracted to have the trailer moved to his new duty \nlocation. The trailer arrived on approximately April 29, 2010, and was dropped off at \nApplicant\u2019s new address. The contractor-driver came back the next day to pick up the \ntrailer. He noticed that remaining in the trailer were 18-20 bags of concrete mix weighing \napproximately 90 pounds each. In early May 2010, someone from the contractor\u2019s \ncompany reported the incident to the post Inspector General\u2019s office. A criminal \ninvestigation commenced under the authority of the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation \nCommand (CID). In June 2010, Applicant was interviewed as part of the investigation \nand in a sworn statement admitted purchasing the concrete bags to intentionally \nincrease his weight for the DITY move so he would be paid more money.

He \nalso believes that the Army\u2019s acceptance of his resignation in lieu of court-martial was \nvindication that he did no wrongdoing. In contrast, in his resignation submission to the \nSecretary of the Army, he apologized to his command and said that he submitted a \nfalse claim for selfish monetary reasons and his actions were shameful and regrettable. \n(Tr. 29-30, 41-42, 50, 63; GE 7, 9, 10, 11, 13) \nAlso during his testimony, Applicant admitted that what he did was wrong (to \nincrease his household good weight), but claims he had no intent to deceive the \ngovernment when he answered \u201cno\u201d to the relevant questions in Sections 13A and 22 \nof his SCA. He believed that once his resignation was accepted and his court-martial \ncharges were dismissed, he did not have to answer \u201cyes\u201d to those questions. He stated \nthat his attorney, who represented him during his Army legal proceedings, told him that \nas well. He admitted giving considerable thought to those questions. I did not find \nApplicant to be credible. (Tr. 33, 48, 51-52, 60) \nApplicant documented that he made restitution to the government for the amount \nof his fraudulent claim. He paid this amount in August 2010. (Tr. 58; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s discharge from the Army based upon his voluntary resignation in lieu \nof facing court-martial charges for theft and filing a false statement support the \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). Neither AG apply under these facts because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is \u201cexplicitly covered under\u201d Guideline J, and his conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the same guideline. However, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct involved questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations raises questions about an his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The general concern \nexpressed in AG \u00b6 15 applies. \nHe deliberately failed to disclose the information as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c, which supports the application of AG \u00b6 16(a) \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant was not credible when he testified that he did not deliberately provide \nfalse information on his SCA about how he left the Army and whether he had been \ncharged with an offense under the UCMJ. He specifically testified that he gave \nconsiderable thought to the questions at the time he completed the SCA. He justified his \naction by saying he was advised by his attorney, who represented him during the legal \nproceedings when he was in the Army, that the dismissal of charges ended that \nprocess. He did not state whether he consulted an attorney concurrently with filling out \nhis SCA. It is apparent from aspects of his testimony and from his DRB applications that \nhe has not accepted responsibility for his actions. While the conduct that led to his \nunder than honorable discharge occurred about 10 years ago, he has not fully accepted \nthe wrongfulness of his actions, which causes me concern about his overall judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply, but AG \u00b6 17(b) has minimal application due to the \npassage of time. However, his offense was not minor and casts doubt on his judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military and federal contractor service and his restitution \nof the money he fraudulently claimed. However, I also considered that he was \ndischarged from the Army with an other than honorable discharge based upon \nattempting to steal money through a fraudulent claim he orchestrated against the \ngovernment. He also has not accepted responsibility for his actions. Additionally, he \ndeliberately failed to disclose material information on his SCA. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.c \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.d.). His comments with respect to both his admissions and his denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as site lead with his current employer overseas since February 2006. In addition, he had been serving in various positions with the U.S. Army on active duty or the inactive reserve, or the Army National Guard in the inactive reserve, from January 1991 until May 2016. Upon completion of his active duty, he was honorably discharged. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. He was granted a secret clearance in 1991, and it was renewed in 2001. In 2007, he was also granted access to Secret Compartmented Information (SCI). He was married in 1991 and divorced in 2017. He married again in 2018. He has four children, born in 1995, 1998, 2002, and 2004, as well as one step- child, born in 2009.

On June 1, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn June 12, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on January 4, 2021, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on January 22, 2021. His response was due on February 21, 2021. Applicant \ntimely responded to the FORM, attaching a one-page statement, as well as an email \nstream which contained immaterial information. Department Counsel did not object to the \ndocuments, and I accepted them into evidence. The case was assigned to me on March \n12, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the SOR allegations pertaining \nto financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.d.). His comments with respect to both his \nadmissions and his denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review \nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas site lead with his current employer overseas since February 2006. In addition, he had \nbeen serving in various positions with the U.S. Army on active duty or the inactive reserve, \nor the Army National Guard in the inactive reserve, from January 1991 until May 2016. \nUpon completion of his active duty, he was honorably discharged. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. He was granted a secret clearance in 1991, and it was \nrenewed in 2001. In 2007, he was also granted access to Secret Compartmented \nInformation (SCI). He was married in 1991 and divorced in 2017. He married again in \n2018. He has four children, born in 1995, 1998, 2002, and 2004, as well as one step-\nchild, born in 2009.  \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated February 16, 2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nMarch 25, 2019); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 30, 2020); Item 7 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October 5, 2018); and Item 1 ((TransUnion Credit \nReport, dated June 8, 2020), attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR). \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn October 2018, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant described his overall financial situation as \u201cok.\u201d \nHe contended that, with the exception of his student loans, all of his bills were current. \n(Item 7, at 6). He attributed his financial problems to a variety of factors: his separation \nand divorce from his former wife, her use of a joint account, and the fact that his wages \nwere garnished for child support. (Item 7, at 5-6) \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling \napproximately $76,080, as set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a student loan with an unpaid balance of $61,735 that was \npast due in January 2018. (Item 4, at 6) During his OPM interview, he acknowledged that \nhe had stopped making payments on the loan when his funds were garnished for child \nsupport. It was his intention to resume making his payments on the student loan when his \ndivorce lawyer\u2019s fees were paid off in February 2019. (Item 7, at 5) However, in his Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant noted that the account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 2) \nHis future intentions are now unclear. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.d. refer to unpaid medical bills for $564, $264, and $217 \nthat were incurred while using military hospitals overseas, and they were past due in June \n2015. (Item 4, at 6) During his OPM interview, he contended that all of the bills had been \npaid in full when he received them, and that it was unclear why they still appeared on his \ncredit report. (Item 7, at 5-6) However, in his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that two of \nthe bills remained unpaid, and that the one for $264 was no longer on his credit report. \n(Item 2) His future intentions are now unclear. The accounts have not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $9,189 that \nwas charged off in January 2012. (Item 4, at 7) During his OPM interview, he contended \nthat it was a joint account that was used by his ex-wife, and that he had requested that \nthe creditor remove his name from the account. (Item 7, at 5) In fact, the account is an \nindividual one in his name only. (Item 4, at 7) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted \nthat the account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 2) His future intentions are now \nunclear. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $4,111 that \nwas charged off. (Item 7, at 5) During his OPM interview, he contended that it was an \naccount that he shared with his ex-wife, but he was unable to continue making payments \nbecause of his child-support obligations. (Item 7, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nnoted that the account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 2) His future intentions \nare now unclear. The account has not been resolved. \nOther than Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions regarding his efforts to resolve \ncertain delinquent accounts, there is no documentary evidence, such as repayment plans, \ncancelled checks, bank account registers, receipts from creditors, or garnishment orders \nto support that he has made any efforts to address any of his delinquent accounts. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nDuring his OPM interview, Applicant reported an annual salary of $72,000, in \naddition to an annual $24,100 housing allowance. Also, he received $19,236 for annual \nvehicle and gasoline, for a total of $115,336. He did not report his current monthly \nexpenses or any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or \nsavings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nIn the absence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling \napproximately $76,080. Although he initially claimed that three of the accounts had been \nresolved, as of the date he responded to the FORM, he had not submitted documentary \nevidence to show that he had resolved any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) and have been established. Instead of following through in \nattempting to resolve the accounts, Applicant has relied on the argument that some of the \naccounts were charged off or they are no longer in his most recent credit report. With a \nsubstantial annual income of $115,336, it appears that he has been unwilling to satisfy \nhis debts, even those of less than $300, regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(c) \nhas also been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \n \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts, make \nit rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, \nmuch like it has been for several years. He attributed his financial problems to a variety \nof factors: his separation and divorce from his former wife, her use of a joint account, and \nthe fact that his wages were garnished for child support. As noted above, he failed to \nspecify the negative impact those factors had on his finances. Paying child support is not \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control: you father a child, and you are expected to support the child. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nApplicant has seemingly \u201cjustified\u201d his inaction with regard to several of his \ndelinquent accounts because they are no longer reported on his credit report. A charged-\noff debt is normally more than six months past due and unlikely to be paid in the near \nfuture. The creditor\u2019s accounting decision to charge off the debt does not affect the \nobligation to pay what is owed. Eventually the charged-off debts will be dropped from his \ncredit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. (Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.) Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide a plan \nto resolve the charged-off debts on his credit report precludes mitigation of those debts \nin this case. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore his \ndelinquent accounts even after he was interviewed by OPM. An applicant who begins to \nresolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security \nclearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. \n(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-\n00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant completed his SF 86 in January 2018; \nunderwent his OPM interview in October 2018; and the SOR was issued in June 2020. \nEach step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. Other than his unverified claims that \nhe had previously paid off three accounts; had his income garnished for child support; \nand intended to make payments on his student loans after he paid off his divorce attorney \nin February 2019, he offered zero documentary evidence to either support his claims, or \nto reflect that he had made any efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. With a substantial annual \nincome of $115,336, it remains difficult to determine why he has not attempted to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts, or if he is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as site \nlead with his current employer overseas since February 2006. In addition, he had been \nserving in various positions with the U.S. Army on active duty or the inactive reserve, or \nthe Army National Guard in the inactive reserve, from January 1991 until May 2016. Upon \ncompletion of his active duty, he was honorably discharged. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2002. He was granted a secret clearance in 1991, and it was renewed in 2001. \nIn 2007, he was also granted access to SCI. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has six delinquent accounts that were placed for \ncollection, totaling approximately $76,080. Although he initially claimed that three of the \naccounts had been resolved, as of the date he responded to the FORM, he had not \nsubmitted documentary evidence to show that he had resolved any of the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR. Instead of attempting to resolve the accounts, Applicant \nhas relied on the argument that some of the accounts were charged off or they are no \nlonger in his most recent credit report. With a substantial annual income of $115,336, it \nappears that he has been unwilling to satisfy his debts, even those of less than $300, \nregardless of an ability to do so. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record is extremely poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me \nwith substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GX 5 at page 16.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has significant past-due debt and delinquent tax filings. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes seven conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these apply.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 12, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated, and in it she elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November 9, \n2020.

Items 1 through 8 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 24, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.k, and 1.m and 1.n. It \nis noted that for the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h, she admitted the allegation, but she \ndisputed the dollar amount alleged. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.l. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. She earned a high school diploma and a certificate from \na business college. She married in 1994 and has three adult children and two adult \nstepchildren. She has worked for her present employer, a federal contractor, since 2014. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant failed to timely file her 2014, 2015 and 2016 state income tax returns \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). She denied this allegation and stated in her answer to the SOR that she has \nfiled every year. Documents from her state tax authority show she did not file for the \nalleged years. Applicant did not provide evidence to show the contrary. (Item 4). \nApplicant admitted she failed to timely pay her federal income taxes for tax years \n2012 ($9,993); 2013 ($5,887); 2014 ($2,890); 2015 ($1,451); 2016 ($1,831); and 2017 \n($1,319). The total amount owed is approximately $23,371. (Item 5). In her April 2017 \nsecurity clearance application she disclosed her failure to pay her 2014 federal income \ntaxes because she did not have the money and was in the process of working out a \npayment plan with the IRS. (Item 3) In response to interrogatories from December 2019 \nshe said \u201cpayment arrangements have been made and are coming out of my husband\u2019s \npaycheck.\u201d (Item 4) In her subsequent answer to the SOR, she said that she was \u201cworking \ndiligently with the IRS to clear this balance.\u201d (Item 2) Applicant failed to provide any \ndocuments to substantiate her claims that she is making payments on her federal tax \ndebt. \nApplicant admitted she owed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, except \nthe debt in \u00b6 1.l ($94), which she said she paid. In her SOR answer, she admitted the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($312) was delinquent, but said she also paid that debt. She stated that \nshe was having payments deducted automatically from her account monthly to pay the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($17,105). She did not provide documentary proof for any of the claims \nshe made about paying these debts. Regarding the remaining delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR, she stated in her answer that she is working with the creditors \u201cto get the \nbalance cleared up.\u201d Credit reports from October 2020, April 2020, and March 2019 \ncorroborate the alleged debts as being delinquent and began accumulating in \napproximately 2018. These debts total approximately $18,645.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2018 and are not paid or resolved. Applicant failed to file her 2014, 2015, \nand 2016 state income tax returns. She owes federal income taxes for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2017. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admitted she owes federal taxes for tax years 2012 through 2017. She \ndid not provide documentary proof of any actions she has taken to pay them. In her 2017 \nsecurity clearance application, she claimed she was working with the IRS. In her 2019 \nanswer to interrogatories she said payments were being made. In her 2020 answer to the \nSOR, she said she was working diligently with the IRS to take care of the matter. Applicant \nhas not provided proof she filed her 2014, 2015 and 2016 state income tax returns. She \nfailed to provide evidence that she has paid any of her other delinquent debts. She \nprovided no explanation for her failure to pay her bills, file her state income tax returns, \nor pay her federal taxes. She disputed certain debts claiming they were paid or being \npaid, but did not provide evidence to substantiate her claim. None of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. Her behavior casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 56 years old. She has been employed since April 2014. She has not \npaid her federal income taxes for tax years 2012 through 2017 and has not filed her 2014, \n2015, and 2016 state tax returns. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant also has numerous delinquent debts. She failed to meet her burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.h. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.j. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since November of 2005. He has held a security clearance since June of 2006. (GX 1 at pages 5, 10 and 34.) He is currently going through a divorce, and has two adult children. (TR at page 15 line 11 to page 20 line 12.) Applicant completed his last two Security Clearance Applications (SCAs) in 2011 (AppX Q), and again in 2016 (GX 1). Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.b.~1.h. Applicant and his, now-estranged spouse had a rental-property side- business involving five properties. (TR at page 23 line 2 to page 29 line 18, at page 30 line 19 to page 31 line 10, at page 48 line 24 to page 49 line 3, at page 64 line 4 to page 65 line 2, and at page 67 lines 6~13.)

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 25, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) His Answer also included Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AppXs) A through H, which were subsequently admitted into evidence. This case was \nassigned to me on June 8, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2021, scheduling the hearing for July 12, 2021. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 \nthrough 7, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf.

DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (TR) on July 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.h. He denied SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.j. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since November of 2005. He has held a security \nclearance since June of 2006. (GX 1 at pages 5, 10 and 34.) He is currently going \nthrough a divorce, and has two adult children. (TR at page 15 line 11 to page 20 line \n12.) Applicant completed his last two Security Clearance Applications (SCAs) in 2011 \n(AppX Q), and again in 2016 (GX 1). \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.b.~1.h. Applicant and his, now-estranged spouse had a rental-property side-\nbusiness involving five properties. (TR at page 23 line 2 to page 29 line 18, at page 30 \nline 19 to page 31 line 10, at page 48 line 24 to page 49 line 3, at page 64 line 4 to page \n65 line 2, and at page 67 lines 6~13.) With the crash of the real-estate market in \n2008~2009, Applicant and his spouse defaulted on the first and second mortgages on \nthese properties. (Id.) He disclosed these foreclosures on his 2011 SCA. (AppX Q at \npages 30~35, and AppX R.) Applicant owes nothing as a result of these foreclosures, \nas evidenced by Federal tax documents, 1099c\u2019s, and by credit reports. (TR at page 68 \nline 22 to page 70 line 14, and AppXs P and S~X2.) \n1.a. and 1.i. In 2018, Applicant and his now-estranged spouse, defaulted on their \nprimary residence secondary loan. This was the result of their HELOC (Home Equity \nLine Of Credit) loan payments increasing to the point that they could not pay them. (TR \nat page 35 line 25 to page 42 line 22, at page 49 lines 8~21, at page 65 line 3 to page \n66 line 16, and at page 67 lines 6~13.) The Applicant owes nothing as a result of this \ndefault, as evidenced by a 1099c, and banking records. (AppXs H at page 3, L, and N at \npage 3.) \n1.j. Applicant is current with his state taxing authority, as evidenced by a \ndocument from his state. (TR at page 42 line 25 to page 44 line 19, at page 67 lines \n14~18, and AppX G.) His estranged spouse never told Applicant of their tax \ndelinquency. Once he was appraised of the fact, said state tax was paid.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant defaulted on mortgage payments on six properties; resulting in \nforeclosures, and had delinquent state taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has addressed all of the allegations, the vast majority of which he \ndisclosed to the Government in 2011, and were the result of the 2008~2009 real-estate \ncrisis. He has also successfully addressed the three post 2008~2009 allegations. \nApplicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant has a distinguished history of \nworking in the defense industry and is also respected in his community. (AppXs C, D, J \nand O.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.
