He earned a high school diploma in June 2005 and a Computer Support Technician Certificate from a technical college in May 2015. He began his current employment as a computer network support technician with a major defense contractor in August 2014, and has held a security clearance since 2018 in connection with that work. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; Tr. 7- 8, 25-28.)

Based upon a review of the record as a \nwhole, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn July 22, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct).

He admitted \nthe SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the \ncase to me on December 1, 2022. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 13, \n2022, setting the hearing for January 26, 2023. On that date, Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. Applicant testified, but offered no \ndocumentary evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to leave the record open until February 15, 2023. for submission of documentary \nevidence in mitigation. Applicant timely submitted a statement of intent and five character-\nreference letters, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B and admitted without \nobjection from Department Counsel. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nFebruary 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. He recently married, for the first time, and has no \nchildren. He earned a high school diploma in June 2005 and a Computer Support \nTechnician Certificate from a technical college in May 2015. He began his current \nemployment as a computer network support technician with a major defense contractor \nin August 2014, and has held a security clearance since 2018 in connection with that \nwork. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; Tr. 7-\n8, 25-28.) \nOn May 24, 2018, Applicant submitted his initial Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance that he needed to \nmove into a position involving access to classified information. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, \nhe responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question in Section 23 asking, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, \nhave you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled \nsubstance includes injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or \notherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance.\u201d He was granted a final Secret \nclearance by the DoD CAF in August 2018. (GE 1; GE 4, Tr. 27-30.) \nIn early 2021 Applicant decided to improve his potential employment opportunities \nby applying for a part-time second job with a government agency (GA). The job required \na Top Secret clearance. He was not asked to submit another e-QIP, but underwent an \nenhanced background investigation. During his initial interview during May 2021, he told \nthe GA investigator that he had not used illegal drugs, including marijuana. He was then \nscheduled to take a July 2021 polygraph test. During the pre-polygraph interview on the \ntest date, he admitted that he had smoked marijuana. The details of the investigation by \nthe GA were not entered into this record. However, Applicant confirmed that he first \ndisclosed his previous use of marijuana to security officials during that July 2021 \ninterview. Due to the resulting security concerns, the GA denied him a clearance and did \nnot hire him.

That security \nofficer directed him to complete another e-QIP, in which he wrote that he had used \nmarijuana between April 2004 and May 2021 in the form of THC candy consumption or \nsmoking. He said this was \u201cvery very infrequent\u201d and occurred a total of approximately 20 \ntimes. This information was forwarded to the DoD CAF, for its consideration whether his \nDoD Secret clearance should be revoked. During an interview with an investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on March 28, 2022, he reiterated that he \nsmoked marijuana approximately 20 times during the reported dates, but said that he had \ndifficulty providing an accurate approximation. He said that he never purchased \nmarijuana, but used it \u201cat parties and sometimes after work,\u201d and that he had not sought \nprofessional counseling or treatment for marijuana use. His testimony during the hearing \nwas broadly consistent with these assertions. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 31-34.) \nApplicant testified that his most recent period of marijuana use occurred during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, when he started a second job moonlighting in a bar and restaurant. \nHe worked there from October 2020 until May 2021. He said he and friends from that \nemployment would go out after the bar closed to share marijuana at parties. His \ndescription of this activity portrayed a regular pattern during this seven-month period. He \nclaimed that these marijuana parties took place on days when the bar closed earlier in \nthe evening, rather than on the nights when it closed in the early morning hours. However, \nhe also said that he did participate when he had to work the next morning at his weekday \njob with the defense contractor. It is unusual that the bar where he worked would have \nclosed early on Friday and Saturday nights, but after midnight on Sundays through \nThursdays preceding his workdays. Those incongruent assertions raise significant \ncredibility issues, as do his repeated and vague minimizations in describing his drug-use \nhistory while holding and seeking to upgrade his security clearance. (Tr. 35-40, 45-47.) \nIn his 2021 e-QIP, Applicant said that he was \u201cin search for a drug awareness \nclass.\u201d In response to DOHA interrogatories he said, \u201cI have research [sic] some drug \nimprovement class, but was unaware which one would fit the [GA] criteria.\u201d During his \nhearing testimony he said that he had not attended any such programs. He described his \ncontinuing use of marijuana until May 2021 as, \u201ca bad choice in judgement,\u201d \u201ca bad \nchoice,\u201d and \u201ca lapse in judgement.\u201d He further stated that he is, \u201ccommitted to not taken \n[sic] any more substance,\u201d and \u201cthere will be no further use after incident.\u201d He no longer \nparties with his former coworkers from the bar. The record contains no evaluation from a \ndoctor or other medical professional assessing the level of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse, or \nexpressing a prognosis for future abstinence. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 38, 45.) \nApplicant testified that, while applying for his initial security clearance with the \ndefense contractor, he intentionally falsified his 2018 e-QIP because he knew that an \nhonest disclosure of his recent marijuana use would reduce his chances to obtain the job \nand a security clearance. He also testified that he knew his marijuana use was illegal at \nthe time. As noted above, he initially attempted to deceive the GA investigators \nconcerning his ongoing marijuana use again in 2021, but admitted it when he was \nconfronted with taking a polygraph examination.

His manager wrote that he always \nworks hard, operates in an ethical manner, performs at a very high level, and has a \nsupportive loving family. Applicant\u2019s wife describes him as \u201ca reliable, trustworthy, \nstraightforward, honest man.\u201d She said he has \u201calways abided by the protocols and \nprocedures of his work, taking classification seriously, never sharing private information, \nand always stepping in to help his coworkers.\u201d She said, \u201cHis integrity is extremely \nimportant to him and others recognize him for it.\u201d (AE B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admittedly used marijuana with varying frequency from April 2004 to May \n2021. His use included multiple occasions after August 2018 when he was granted \nnational security eligibility and began working with classified information. This establishes \nsecurity concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (b). Accordingly, the burden to mitigate these \nconcerns shifts to Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021. \nIn her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have legalized or \ndecriminalized the use of marijuana. She reaffirmed the 2014 SecEA memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \nViewed in the context of the whole person, Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by marijuana use from his junior year of high school though May 2021, \nwhen he was confronted with a pending polygraph examination likely to reveal his \npersistent false denials of this drug abuse some three years after his initial clearance. He \nknew that his drug involvement was both illegal and contrary to security policies, yet it \ncontinued due to his admitted bad choices and lapses in judgment. He claims to have no \nintention to use in the future, and to have stopped associating with his friends in the places \nwhere they used drugs. However, only his self-serving statements support these \nassertions, which were not addressed by the friends and family members who wrote \nletters on his behalf. His admitted long history of drug abuse ended only two years ago, \nand only when he was faced with a polygraph examination. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThis evidence does not establish that drug abuse is unlikely to recur, and it casts \ncontinuing doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nSubstantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) was not established. Other potential \nmitigating conditions are inapplicable in the absence of prescription drug abuse or any \nevidence of drug treatment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant deliberately falsified his 2018 e-QIP concerning his use of marijuana with \nvarying frequency since 2004, because he knew it to have been illegal and detrimental to \nobtaining his national security eligibility. He admits that he intended to conceal this \ninformation. He also attempted to conceal his continuing drug abuse after obtaining a \nclearance when he applied to the GA in 2021, because he admittedly knew that it would \nnegatively affect his personal and professional standing. The record evidence clearly \nestablishes \u201cspecial interest\u201d security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(a), and 16(e). \nAG \u00b6 17 includes three conditions that could mitigate the security concern arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant provided insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions. He finally admitted the falsification in 2021 when confronted with the \nGA polygraph examination, but this was neither a prompt nor a good faith effort to correct \nthe concealment that he had attempted to continue earlier that year. He only confessed \nto his company FSO after the GA denial of his clearance became a matter of record, \nwhich was not the type of \u201cpositive step\u201d that would demonstrate trustworthiness or \nsignificantly reduce vulnerability. Applicant\u2019s falsification and concealment were not minor \noffenses. They occurred over a recent three-year period, and under circumstances that \nwere not unique. He engaged in purposeful deception concerning information that he \nknew to have security significance, in order to pursue what he perceived to be his self-\ninterest. His conduct casts continuing doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nintentionally attempted to conceal his past drug abuse, failing to demonstrate either \nrehabilitation or accountability for his misuse of marijuana before and during the time he \nwas granted a security clearance. He failed to convincingly demonstrate his intention to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabstain from further substance misuse. He provided insufficient evidence of his \ntrustworthiness, responsibility, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. The \npotential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Recurrence of \nsubstance misuse is not unlikely given his history. \nOverall, the evidence creates significant doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and the Personal \nConduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDAVID M. WHITE \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor working as a simulation technician since February 2020. He holds an associate degree and is a few hours away from earning his bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married for the third time (1995-2014, 2015- 2019, 2019-present).

He holds an associate degree and is a few hours away \nfrom earning his bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married for the third time (1995-2014, 2015-\n2019, 2019-present). He has three children from his first marriage and three stepchildren \nfrom his current marriage. He pays $900 monthly in child support for his youngest child, \nage 16, from his first marriage.

He also made restitution in the approximate amount of $9,000. (Tr. 16, 25; GE \n3) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged four delinquent accounts (two car debts and \ntwo consumer debts) totaling approximately $27,774. The debts are established by credit \nreports from February 2017 and August 2021; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) \nwith an investigator in November 2021; and his SOR response admissions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n\u2013 1.d).

He pleaded \nguilty and was sentenced to four months confinement, and a reduction in grade to E-7. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant testified that he did not pay any of the SOR debts and stated they no \nlonger appear on his credit report because they aged off.

He stated that his \ncontentious divorce from his first wife, which encompassed the years 2014-2016, caused \nhim great financial strain resulting in these delinquencies. These debts were not resolved \nby Appellant. (Tr. 17, 21; GE 2, 6-9; AE A; SOR Answer) \nApplicant testified that his current finances are in good shape. He stated he has \nno new delinquencies. His July 2023 credit report shows one collection account for $456, \nwhich had a date of last activity in September 2016 (this debt was not alleged in the SOR \nand will not be considered for disqualification purposes, but it may be considered for \ncredibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-person factors). Appellant\u2019s and his \ncurrent wife\u2019s monthly take-home pay total approximately $14,600. He did not give an \nestimate of his monthly expenses during his testimony. During his background interview, \nhe told the investigator that he had approximately $6,500 left over at the end of the month \nwhich he would use to begin paying his delinquent debts. He presented no evidence that \nhe has done this. (Tr. 18, 21, 26; GE 2) \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant admitted to the conduct for which he was tried and convicted at an Army \nSpecial Court-Martial in July 2019. Applicant was the staff noncommissioned officer in \ncharge (NCOIC) of a college ROTC detachment. In that role, he had access to and control \nover the unit\u2019s funds and accounts generated through fund raising. At the time, he was \ngeographically separated from his first wife and three children, who lived in a different \nstate (State A). His wife filed for divorce and Applicant was required to travel to State A \nfor the divorce proceedings and to see his daughters. He did not have the personal funds \nto do this, so he decided to take money from the ROTC accounts. A subsequent Army \ninvestigation determined that he deposited 33 checks from three ROTC accounts into his \npersonal account from about 2013 to 2017. When questioned by investigators, he claimed \nhe had no knowledge of the missing ROTC funds and denied any wrongdoing. (Tr. 19, \n21-22, 24; GE 2, 4; AE A; SOR Answer) \nLater, Applicant pleaded guilty to disobeying a superior officer, larceny, and \nmaking a false official statement. He was sentenced as indicated above. He fully paid \nrestitution in the amount of $9,050 within the time allowed. He testified that he understood \nthat his actions were a breach of his integrity and the trust reposed in him based upon his \nmilitary status. (Tr. 22-24; AE A) \nAppellant testified that he has had no further employment misconduct since this \nincident, nor has he had any subsequent arrests by law enforcement. His record shows \nthat in 1994, when he was a private second-class, he was apprehended for shoplifting \nfrom an Army and Air Force Exchange facility. His exchange privilege card was \nconfiscated, and he was turned over to his unit. No further information was included (this \nallegation was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for disqualification \npurposes, but it may be considered for credibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-\nperson factors).

(AE B-D) \nApplicant testified that he teaches firearms safety as an additional job. He also \nqualified for a Federal Firearms License (FFL), which he claimed required an FBI \nbackground check. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant received a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis in 2014. \nHis PTSD is related to events that transpired during his combat deployments. (Tr. 25) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred four delinquent debts. Although facing financial stress due to a \npending divorce, he did nothing to address the debts. At one time he was financially \nunable to pay these debts. More recently he had the ability to pay them, yet he chose not \nto do so. I find that all of the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing, and he has not made any \npayments toward them. His inaction towards resolving his debts casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s divorce was a condition beyond his control. However, his decision to \nnot pay his debts was a choice he made. Additionally, he did not act responsibly \nconcerning his debts when he decided to allow them to fall off his credit report due to age. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. Apparently, his plan to \ndeal with his debts was to do nothing and to let them fall off his credit report. While this \nmay be an appropriate option to take viewed through a financial prism, it does not equate \nto acting responsibly and in good faith, and it puts into question his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b616 and the following potentially apply: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \nApplicant was the senior NCOIC who was entrusted with ROTC funds. He violated \nthat trust, over a period of years, by taking funds on multiple occasions from the unit \naccounts. He stole over $9,000 of ROTC funds to pay for his personal trips to State A. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, \nthe general concerns about questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and a pattern of \ndishonesty contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(c), and 16(d) are established. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nStealing over $9,000 from ROTC funds is not a minor offense. His theft is \naggravated by the fact that he was in a senior leadership position and breached the trust \nthat was placed in him. He also was not forthcoming when he was initially questioned \nabout this incident. Additionally, while remote, he has a history of dishonest conduct going \nback to his apprehension for shoplifting as a young soldier. There was no evidence of \ncounseling. The stressors caused by his divorce may now be over, but that is insufficient \nto overcome the doubt cast on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment by his past \nlarceny and breaches of trust. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, VA disability, and favorable character \nevidence. However, I also considered that he did not attempt to pay his debts or take any \nother action to resolve his delinquent debts. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, and his plan to let his debts fall off his credit report causes \nme to question his reliability and willingness to resolve his debts in the future. His theft of \nROTC funds for which he was responsible in order to affect personal gain also causes \nme to question his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations or personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Items 1-4) \nApplicant filed his late 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal income tax returns \nwith the IRS in July 2021. He also filed his late 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 state \nincome tax returns in July 2021. He filed these income tax returns after he submitted his \nMay 2021 Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86). He provided \ndocumentary corroboration of these filings in the form of signed and unsigned copies of \nhis relevant income tax returns. Most of the income tax returns were prepared by a \nprofessional tax preparer. He claimed that he filed his late federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax year 2021, without providing corroborating evidence. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that he resolved his delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2020. \nA November 2022 letter from the IRS shows that a portion of his 2018 tax year refund \nwas applied to his 2020 tax delinquency, reducing his 2018 refund to $9.52. The IRS \nwould not have provided this refund if he still owed delinquent taxes for tax year 2020. \nTherefore, I find that he resolved his 2020 tax year delinquency in November 2022. \n(Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that he did not timely file the aforementioned income tax \nreturns because he was depressed after separating from his wife, because of laziness, \nand because of the COVID-19 pandemic. His granddaughter passed away in 2021, and \nhe claimed that her death caused him to miss the deadline for filing his 2020 state \nincome tax returns. He claimed that he will comply with his income tax return filings in \nthe future. In April 2022, he submitted a personal financial statement showing that he \nhas a surplus of about $375 after his expenses are paid at the end of each month. \n(Items 2-4, 8; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2016 through \n2019 and 2021 tax years. He failed to timely file his state income tax returns for the \n2016 through 2021 tax years. He owed the IRS delinquent federal taxes for the 2020 tax \nyear. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhile Applicant has now filed most of his late federal and state income tax \nreturns, he has not provided documentary evidence that he filed his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2021. It is reasonable to expect him to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of his claimed income tax filings. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Therefore, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he has remedied his failure to file his income tax returns. \nFor the relevant income tax returns Applicant has filed, he did so only after \nbeginning the clearance process. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns \nonly after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack \nthe judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). This timing cuts against his efforts to show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or in good faith. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to his \nfailure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and those allegations are \nnot mitigated. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2020, as he has \nprovided sufficient evidence that he has resolved those taxes, I find that AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies. He has mitigated the SOR allegations concerning his delinquent 2020 taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying\nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\n \n \nApplicant accrued delinquent consumer debts during a period of unemployment \nafter leaving military service. The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He has been employed since January 2021. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge to \ndeliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under Mitigating \nCondition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). His recent actions to resolve \ntwo debts only after receiving the FORM does not receive this mitigating credit. See ISCR \nCase No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish that he has made \na good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant attributes his debts to a period of unemployment and underemployment \nafter leaving the military. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For full \nconsideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. He completed his SCA in \nFebruary 2021. The most recent record evidence (April 2022 credit report) shows all the \ndebts remained past due. He addressed two debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, approximately \none week after he received the FORM. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in \njeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). Even though Applicant\u2019s \ndebts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control, he did not provide \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is detailed in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nApplicant incurred alcohol-related arrests in 2006 and 2019. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 22(c) also applies, as the record evidence of the two alcohol-related arrests supports \na finding that Applicant engaged in recent, habitual consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 DUI arrest did not deter his behavior, as he incurred another DWI \nin 2019. He acknowledges the maladaptive effect alcohol has had on his life and states \nhe now abstains from alcohol. He asserts that he has fulfilled all his legal obligations for \nhis 2019 DUI conviction and that he also completed the military\u2019s SARP, but he has not \nsubmitted documentary evidence to corroborate his claims. He has submitted no \nevidence that he is participating in an ongoing counseling or treatment program or that \nhe is making satisfactory progress in any treatment program. While he declares he now \nabstains from alcohol and has no intentions of drinking in the future, Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to establish that the security concern regarding his history of \nproblematic alcohol involvement is mitigated. None of the above mitigating conditions fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and G in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are largely attributable to circumstances beyond his control, they remain \nlargely unresolved. He was arrested for DUI in 2006 and was arrested and convicted of \nDWI in 2019. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F and G and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts and his alcohol-related conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b and 1.e-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on November 8, 2022. On November 9, 2022, a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. The FORM consists of five items. FORM Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in \nthe case, and FORM Items 3-5 are the Government\u2019s evidence, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant received the FORM on December 2, 2022, and he \nresponded with an undated three-page statement, which was marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A and admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 23, 2022. \nEvidentiary Issue \nThe FORM Item 3 is a summary of an enhanced subject interview (ESI) \nconducted on February 1, 2022. The summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions, \nor updates; or to object to consideration of the summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant submitted a detailed response to the FORM but did not \ncomment on the accuracy or completeness of the summary, nor did he object to it. I \nconclude that he waived any objections to FORM Item 3. Although pro se applicants are \nnot expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps \nto protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. \n12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations of drug \ninvolvement in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. He stated that he \u201ctechnically\u201d admitted the allegation of \nfalsification in SOR \u00b6 2.a, but he denied intending to deceive. I have treated his answer \nto SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old information technology technician employed by a \ndefense contractor since June 2021. His work site is on a military installation, and he \nhas access to classified information.1 He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice \nin December 2010 and a technical certification in January 2019. He married in June \n2016 and has no children. He has held a security clearance since March 2020.

While walking between bars, the group was confronted by two loud, \nobnoxious, and aggressive men, resulting in an affray that was stopped by nearby \npolice officers. All the participants were handcuffed and transported to the police station. \nWhen Applicant was searched by the police, they found a small quantity of cocaine in a \nplastic bag in his pocket. He was charged with participating in an affray, a \nmisdemeanor, and felony possession of a Schedule II controlled substance. \nIn May 2021, with the assistance of an attorney and pursuant to a plea \nagreement, Applicant pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia. The charges \nof participating in an affray and the felony drug charges were dismissed. He was \nrequired to complete a 16-hour program of drug classes, and he was placed on \nunsupervised probation for one year. (FORM Item 3 at 50-51; FORM Item 5 at 6) During \nthe ESI in February 2022, Applicant admitted that he had used cocaine in college as \nwell as on the night of the affray. (FORM Item 5 at 5.) \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in December 2021, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to a \nquestion in Section 22\u2014Police Record, asking whether, in the last seven years, he had \nbeen or was currently on probation or parole. He disclosed an arrest in April 2014 for \ndriving under the influence (DUI), his conviction in August 2015, and a sentence that \nincluded one year of unsupervised probation. He also disclosed his arrest in May 2021 \nfor the drug offense and participating in an affray, his conviction of possessing \nparaphernalia, and his sentence that included probation for one year. \nHowever, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to two questions in Section 23\u2014Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Drug Activity. The first question asked if, in the last seven years, he had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances, and the second question asked if he \nhad ever illegally used or had otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance other than previously listed. His \nanswers to the questions in Section 23 are the basis for the allegation that he falsified \nhis SCA. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that when he completed his \nSCA, it contained the answers from previous SCAs, and he updated the portion asking \nabout arrests but skimmed through the section asking about use of drugs. He stated \nthat during the ESI, the investigator went through each section of the SCA, and when \nthey reached the section on drug use, he told the investigator that the subject was \naddressed in the section involving arrests. He told the investigator that there were \nmultiple sections in the SCA with similar questions, and he thought that providing the \ninformation in one section was sufficient.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifications under this guideline; \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare \nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine in college is not \nrecent, but his use of cocaine at the birthday celebration in March 2021 is recent, and it \nreflects a continuation of his college-age attitude toward illegal drug use.  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant completed the drug-education \nprogram that was a condition of the probation imposed after his most recent conviction. \nHowever, he continues to associate with some of the same college friends who used \ncocaine in March 2021, and he has not provided the statement of intent in AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3). \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not established. Applicant completed an drug education program, \nbut he has not completed a \u201cprescribed drug treatment program\u201d that includes \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, and he has not provided a \u201cfavorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by answering \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestions asking if he had, in the last seven years, illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances and asking if had ever illegally used or been illegally involved with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance, other than previously listed. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his negative answers in Section 23 after disclosing his \ndrug use while holding a security clearance in Section 22 is plausible and credible. He \nwas careless, but not intentionally deceptive. His full disclosure of his drug-related \nconduct in Section 22 is sufficient to refute the allegation that he was attempting to \nconceal it in Section 23. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. No other disqualifying conditions \nunder Guideline E are alleged. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

His request for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 28, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation as part of his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the results \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine, as required by \nExecutive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), that it \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access \nto classified information. \nOn September 6, 2022, the DOD CAF sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse). This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on November 1, 2022. The FORM proffered five exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 5) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. Applicant \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits or to \nprovide other additional information. He did not respond to the FORM, and he did not file \nany objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits within the allotted time. Accordingly, GX 1 \u2013 \n5 became part of the record, which closed on December 1, 2022. I received the case for \ndecision on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that between June 2017 and May 2018, \nApplicant used marijuana approximately 300 times while he had access to classified \ninformation (SOR 1.a); and that during the same period, he purchased marijuana with \nvarying frequency while he had access to classified information (SOR 1.b). He admitted \nwithout comment both allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on my review of the information \npresented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked since August 2011. He and his wife have been married since July 2010 and they \nhave three children. He was first granted a security clearance in September 2011. \n(FORM, Items 3 and 5) \nApplicant first used marijuana in high school and college between September 1997 \nand May 2004. During this period, he smoked marijuana as often as daily, and at least \nweekly, purchasing the drug from people he knew, including his brother. He stopped in \n2004 because he felt he no longer needed it. He also did not want to spend money buying \nmarijuana when he also had to pay for his college education. (FORM, Item 4) \nIn 2017, marijuana became legal in the state where Applicant lives. He decided to \nstart using it again because it was legal under state law and because he felt it may help \nwith his anxiety. During a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator \non November 22, 2021, he estimated that he used marijuana about 300 times between \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJune 2017 and May 2018. He knew at that time that his use of marijuana, while having a \nsecurity clearance, was \u201cforbidden\u201d and could disqualify him from access to sensitive \ninformation. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nIn May 2018, Applicant checked himself into a hospital for treatment of severe \nanxiety, depression, and related behavioral problems. He believes his extensive use of \nmarijuana over the previous year had altered his brain chemistry and caused him to \nbehave erratically towards his wife. Applicant no longer experiences the behavioral issues \nthat he believes were caused or exacerbated by his marijuana use. He has not used \nmarijuana or any other illegal substance since May 2018. (FORM, Item 4) \nThe summary of his PSI reported that Applicant did not disclose his drug use to \nhis employer\u2019s security office; however, in response to DOHA interrogatories, he averred \nthat after he was hospitalized in 2018, he was asked to submit \u201ca preemptive SF 86\u201d in \nwhich he disclosed his drug use while cleared. He also reported his drug use in his \nSeptember 2021 e-QIP. (FORM, Item 4) \nApplicant no longer associates with the people with whom he used marijuana. In \nhis e-QIP, in his PSI, and in his notarized response to interrogatories, he stated his \nintention to abstain from any future use of marijuana. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013, which was updated by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in \nDecember 2021, makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his \nstate of residence, was illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by \ncivilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant illegally purchased, possessed, and used marijuana in high school and \ncollege between 1997 and 2004. As alleged in the SOR, he purchased and used \nmarijuana in 2017 and 2018 while also having access to classified information. Despite \nthe legalization of marijuana at the state level in 2017, his conduct in this regard remained \nillegal under federal law and was incompatible with his eligibility to access classified \ninformation through his employment as a federal contractor. This information reasonably \nraises the security concern about drug involvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nBy contrast, I have considered the potential applicability of the pertinent mitigating \nconditions presented under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. By contrast, it has been nearly five years \nsince Applicant last used marijuana. He no longer associates with persons who use illegal \ndrugs, and he has clearly expressed his intent to abstain from using marijuana in the future. \nThis information supports application of the cited mitigating conditions. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \nsupports a fair and commonsense decision in favor of the Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked as a consultant since about December 2020. He has also been self-employed as a consultant since about July 2017. He is a citizen of Nigeria and a naturalized U.S. citizen. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in 2010. He is twice divorced. He married for the third time in December 2017. He is a father to seven- year-old twins and a three-year-old. (Tr. 20-27, 65; GE 1, 2) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts totaling approximately $35,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). These delinquencies were for credit cards. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact and are corroborated by the Government\u2019s February 2023 and May 2022 credit reports. Despite being required to do so, Applicant did not divulge these financial delinquencies on his October 2021 security clearance application (SCA). During his November 2021 security interview, he did not disclose these delinquencies until the investigator confronted him with them.

He has also been self-employed \nas a consultant since about July 2017. He is a citizen of Nigeria and a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in 2010. He is \ntwice divorced. He married for the third time in December 2017. He is a father to seven-\nyear-old twins and a three-year-old. (Tr. 20-27, 65; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $35,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). These delinquencies were for credit \ncards. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact and are corroborated by the Government\u2019s February 2023 and May 2022 credit \nreports. Despite being required to do so, Applicant did not divulge these financial \ndelinquencies on his October 2021 security clearance application (SCA). During his \nNovember 2021 security interview, he did not disclose these delinquencies until the \ninvestigator confronted him with them. These failures to voluntarily divulge his financial \ndelinquencies were not listed on the SOR. Any adverse information not alleged in the \nSOR, such as Applicant\u2019s failure to divulge financial delinquencies, cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (SOR; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $20,848 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a has been \nresolved. Applicant opened this credit card in June 2016 to pay for living expenses. He \nbecame delinquent on the account in February 2020. He claimed he fell behind on this \naccount because of the extra expenses he incurred because one of his children was \ndiagnosed with autism. He also claimed that he was not making nearly as much money \nin February 2020 as he currently does. During his November 2021 security interview, he \nclaimed that he had a dispute with some of the charges on the account. He provided no \ndocumentation to corroborate or substantiate the nature or validity of his dispute with \nthe charges on this account. He first contacted the creditor to settle this account in \nabout January or February 2022. After a delay caused by his indecisiveness regarding \nthe effect his settlement would have on the mortgage he was attempting to secure, \nApplicant made a payment arrangement to pay off this debt in July 2022. He complied \nwith this payment arrangement by paying a down payment of $2,999, five monthly \npayments of $2,000, and a $4,000 payment in January 2023. He provided an undated \ndocument reflecting that he settled this account for less than the full balance.

He provided no documentation to \ncorroborate or substantiate the nature or validity of his dispute with his employer or his \nefforts to resolve it. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that the \ncreditor denied his access to the account. He claimed he fell behind on this account \nbecause of his dispute, because he did not have access to this account, because of the \nextra expenses he incurred because one of his children was diagnosed with autism, and \nbecause he was not making nearly as much money in 2018 as he currently does. After \nhis account access was allegedly denied, on several occasions, he received written \ncommunications from the creditor advising him that his account was delinquent and \nproviding contact information to resolve it. In August 2022, he settled the account for \nless than the full balance by making a lump-sum payment of $1,989. He provided a \ndocument from the creditor dated August 24, 2022, reflecting the terms of his pending \nsettlement. The February 2023 credit report corroborates that he settled the account. \n(Tr. 17-19, 46-61, 65-69; Answer; GE 2-4; AE A, C) \nSince about early 2018, Applicant has earned at least $165,000 to $200,000 \nannually in salary. He did not provide information regarding his earnings prior to 2018. \nBeginning in December 2020, he earned about $390,000 in annual wages. Applicant\u2019s \nwife, a Nigerian citizen, earns about $200,000 in annual wages. She and Applicant\u2019s \nchildren lived in Country A, so they do not combine their income. Instead, they pay their \nexpenses separately. Applicant, his spouse, and his children now live together in the \nUnited States. Applicant has approximately $50,000 to $100,000 in a savings account. \nHe has several hundred thousand dollars invested in stocks. He has about $100,000 \ninvested in a retirement account. In about May 2016, he purchased a home for over \n$400,000. His monthly mortgage is about $3,300. In 2015, he financed the purchase of \na vehicle for $72,000. His monthly payments on this vehicle were over $900 until he \nsatisfied the car note in about July 2021. (Tr. 21-27, 63-65, 69-71) \nWhile Applicant was delinquent on at least one of the SOR accounts, he took \nnumerous trips involving international flights that were not related to work. Some of \nthese trips were vacations. Some were trips to visit his family in Country A. Some were \nto visit his family in Country B. Applicant claimed that his wife paid for some of these \ntrips with her own income, but he did not specify which trips and he did not provide any \ndocumentation to corroborate this claim. Applicant acknowledged that several of the \ntrips he made that he paid for while the SOR accounts were delinquent cost at least \n$1,000 each. (Tr. 55-59; GE 1, 2) \nIn addition to not earning as much money as he later did, having disputes about \nboth SOR delinquencies, and having a child diagnosed with autism, Applicant claimed \nhe did not settle his debts until after the SOR was issued because he had to pay for \nother expenses for his family. For example, he claimed that he had to pay for a live-in \nnanny in Country A, and he had to pay for his family and him to make trips to visit one \nanother. He also claimed that he has always had enough money to pay his debts, but \nhe did not prioritize the SOR debts until the time he satisfied them.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had two delinquent debts totaling about $35,000 that were delinquent \nfor years. Despite earning a significant amount of money since 2018, his expenses \ninitially left him unable to pay these debts. In December 2020, he almost doubled his \nalready significant salary. At that point, (and possibly earlier), he had the ability to \nsatisfy these debts but chose not to until after the Government issued the SOR. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile Applicant has resolved his delinquencies by settling them for less than the \nfull amount, he did not do so until after he received his SOR. An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance or eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nand willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). He \ntherefore has not shown that he resolved the debts in good faith. He settled the second \nof his delinquent debts about two months ago, so he has not established a track record \nof financial responsibility sufficient to show that his financial delinquencies are unlikely \nto recur. \nHe has provided evidence that his delinquencies resulted (at least in part) from \nhis child\u2019s autism and were therefore beyond his control. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to \napply, he must also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to these debts. As he waited until July 2022 to begin to pay these debts despite \nhaving the means to do so earlier, he has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant claimed that he had disputes regarding both SOR debts. However, he \nprovided no documentary evidence to substantiate any fraudulent charges for the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a or that his former employer should have paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \nalso did not provide documentary corroboration that he disputed the debts with the \ncreditor, the credit reporting agencies, or his former employer. It is reasonable to expect \nApplicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Absent this proof, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to show that his disputes were reasonable. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) partially apply. None of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions are fully applicable and the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant was evasive \nduring his testimony. He claimed that he could not remember recent, noteworthy dates, \nsuch as an approximation of when he began working for his current employer or when \nhe contacted creditors. Multiple times during the hearing, I admonished him to answer \nappropriate cross-examination questions.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has included the debt, alleged in subparagraph 1.a, in a \nbankruptcy filing, negating the creditor\u2019s ability to accept payments towards its satisfaction, \nand she has taken responsibility for the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e under a \nsettlement agreement, leaving Applicant only responsible for the debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, and 1.f. He satisfied all of these remaining debts. \nAlthough Applicant certainly could have documented his attempts at satisfying these \ndebts earlier, he has clearly established that he has no current financial problems. \nMoreover, his payment of all the delinquent debts, for which he was responsible, bolsters \nthe credibility of his contention that his financial problems were a temporary aberration \ncaused by the income reduction he experienced after his divorce. I conclude that all of the \nmitigating conditions, as set forth above, are applicable. Applicable has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nGiven the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s incurrence of the delinquent debt, \nand his satisfaction of the debts for which he remains responsible, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness position.

In about 2017, she had surgery, and she was out of work for at least a month. In about 2021 or 2022, she had an organ transplant, and she was out of work for about two months. She also has a sporadic work history due to working for non-profits that had funding issues. He had surgery in about 2022, which caused him to be out of work for about three weeks.

He earned an associate degree \nin 2012. He is married with three adult children. (Tr. at 22, 47; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $33,000. The debts are\nlisted on an August 2021 credit report, a November 2022 credit report, or both credit \nreports. Most of the debts were opened from 2015 through 2018 and became \ndelinquent between 2017 and 2019. (Tr. at 26, 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-\n3) \n \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties primarily to his and his wife\u2019s medical \nproblems, which were compounded by employment issues. His wife developed cancer \nin about 2009, their medical insurance did not cover all the bills, and she was out of \nwork for about six to eight months. In about 2017, she had surgery, and she was out of \nwork for at least a month. In about 2021 or 2022, she had an organ transplant, and she \nwas out of work for about two months. She also has a sporadic work history due to \nworking for non-profits that had funding issues. He had surgery in about 2022, which \ncaused him to be out of work for about three weeks. He lost a job he held for around 35 \nyears in about September 2020, and was unemployed for two to three weeks before he \nobtained his current job. He believes the COVID-19 pandemic led to the company \nletting him go. He earned about $17.50 an hour at his previous job, and about $15 an \nhour at his current job. (Tr. at 14-17, 20, 22-27, 43, 46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant started addressing his delinquent debts in about 2020. The August \n2021 credit report lists four collection accounts that were paid or settled in 2020 or \n2021. He also settled a debt for $292, with the last payment in August 2021. Those five \ndebts, which totaled about $1,800, were not alleged in the SOR because they were \nresolved before the SOR was issued. (Tr. at 41; GE 1-3; AE A, B) \nApplicant settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f before the SOR was issued, with \nthe final payment of $372 in January 2022. The August 2021 credit report listed the \nbalance of the debt as $1,060. The SOR alleged the debt as $688. It is unclear where \nthat amount came come, possibly another credit report that was not offered in evidence. \nThe November 2022 credit report lists the balance as $0. (Tr. at 33; GE 2, 3; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; AE D) \nApplicant and the collection company for the $428 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i \nagreed to resolve the debt through six monthly payments of $68, starting in January \n2023. Applicant documented that he made the first four payments. The last two \npayments were not due as of the date of the hearing. (Tr. at 34; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2, 3; AE C) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h allege $663 and $526 debts to the same collection company \nfor the same bank. He settled and paid the $663 debt in April 2023. He settled and paid \nthe $526 debt in May 2023.

(Tr. at 32; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant borrowed about $14,500 from his 401(k) retirement account with his \nprevious employer. When he was laid off, he was unable to pay back the loan, and it \nwas treated by the IRS as a distribution from his retirement account, which created tax \nconsequences in tax year 2021. He paid about $1,100 to resolve the state tax debt. For \nabout the last year, he has been paying the IRS around $189 per month on a tax debt \nthat was originally about $4,000. (Tr. at 17-20, 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nThere are another six SOR debts totaling about $27,600 that have not been \naddressed. Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but they have improved. His wife is \ncurrently working full time, and he is starting to get overtime hours. He is a disabled \nveteran and receives about $1,100 a month from the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nHe worked to resolve his smaller debts first, in the hope that he could then secure a \nloan to pay or settle all of them. He credibly testified that he planned to continue that \ncourse until all the delinquent debts and taxes are paid, either collectively through a \nloan, or individually one at a time. (Tr. at 15, 21-24, 27-44, 46; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were primarily related to his and his wife\u2019s medical \nproblems and their employment issues. He started addressing his delinquent debts in \nabout 2020, well before the SOR was issued. He resolved five non-SOR debts, which \ntotaled about $1,800, before the SOR was issued, and he resolved a $1,060 debt \n(alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f as $688), in January 2022, before the SOR was issued. He \nresolved the $663 and $526 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h in April and May 2023. \nHe completed four of the six $68 monthly payments to resolve the $428 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. He paid his state taxes, and he has been paying his installment agreement \nwith the IRS for about a year. He credibly testified that he planned to continue to pay all \nhis delinquent debts and taxes, either collectively through a loan, or individually one at a \ntime. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first.

See ISCR Case \nNo. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay. 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant\u2019s \ndebts will not be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security \nconcern.\u201d The above mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.1 \n1 Appendix C of the adjudicative guidelines gives me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite \nthe presence of issue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that \nadditional security measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have \nconcluded the issues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s \nfinances. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on September 12, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated nine delinquent \ndebts exceeding $25,000. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, denying \nonly the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.h-1.i. He claimed he was sued \nby the creditor associated with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e and received dismissals in both \ncases for lack of supporting contract documentation. He claimed disputes over SOR \u00b6\u00b6  \n1.h and 1.i for lack of recognition. For those admitted allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.d, he claimed settlement agreements were reached with the respective \ncreditors.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 2008 and has one daughter (age 13) from this \nmarriage. (GE 1) He earned a high school diploma in June 2004, an associates degree \nin August 2013, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in August 2016. \n(GE 1) He enlisted in the Army in May 2005 and served four years of active duty before \nreceiving an honorable discharge in May 2009. (GE 1) \nSince October 2009, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nsubcontract manager. (GE 1; Tr. 28-29) He has held a security clearance since \nFebruary 2012.

(GE 8; Tr. 25-26) Child \nemergencies depleted his family\u2019s savings and contributed to the disarray of his \nfinances and resulting delinquencies in his accounts. (Tr. 27-28) \nAll of Applicant\u2019s cited consumer accounts remain delinquent and unaddressed \nat this time, the result of either unsuccessful creditor enforcement action (SOR \u00b6 1.a) or \nApplicant\u2019s failure to devote sufficient attention to his listed-SOR debts (i.e., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.g). (GEs 4-7) To help him in addressing his delinquent accounts and clear them \nfrom his credit report, he pursued debt consolidation and credit repair in 2017. (Tr. 42) \nAfter several months of working with the credit repair firm without any tangible results, \nhe ceased using the firm. (Tr. 42-43) Applicant currently has no documented plans to \naddress and pay off his SOR-listed creditors. (Tr. 53-61) \nApplicant earns $93,400 annually in base salary and earns additional overtime \nhours (10 to 12) monthly. (Tr. 30) After taxes, he nets approximately $6,400 a month \nfrom his work. And, he receives an additional $820 a month in disability benefits from \nthe Veterans Administration (VA). (Tr. 30-31) \nContributing to his monthly income is his wife who, although not currently \nemployed, receives $17,500 a month in disability benefits. (Tr. 32) Applicant currently \nhas $3,230 in his checking account and $40,000 in a savings account. (Tr. 33) He also \nhas a modest 401(k) retirement account.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. Both need to be considered together in making a comprehensiv whole-\nperson evaluation. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  . .

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited medical issues associated with his young son\u2019s medical \ncomplications contributed considerably to his accumulated debt delinquencies. His \ndelinquent debts (opened individually by Applicant) accrued during his marriage reflect \nsome extenuating circumstances beyond his ability to manage and control. Considering \nall of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s added financial burdens, mitigating \ncondition (MC) \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent accounts once the issues associated \nwith his son\u2019s medical complications stabilized and he had regained his financial footing, \nprevented him from taking advantage of the full benefits of MC \u00b620(b). Because he has \nnot demonstrated enough diligent exercise of financial responsibility while dealing with \nhis son\u2019s medical issues, he is not in a position to take full advantage of the second \nprong of MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Without more \ndemonstrated effort in addressing his major debts, Applicant cannot meet the minimum \neligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant experienced a significant decrease in income in 2020 due to the COVID\u00ad\n19 pandemic and a brief period of unemployment in November 2021. He primarily \nattributes his delinquent debts to his decreased income, which was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e are listed as disputed on Applicant\u2019s \nApril 2022 CBR and do not appear on his January 2023 CBR. His bases for his disputes \nare legitimate. These debts are resolved. The $145 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g \nhas been paid. \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant formally disputed the $3,908 debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c), owed to the dental clinic for his braces, with the creditor or with the credit reporting \nagencies. While he may have had a legitimate dispute with the application of his braces \nand the dental clinic\u2019s refusal to address the issues he was having with them, simply \nrefusing to pay a contractual obligation due to dissatisfaction is not a valid legal remedy. \nApplicant has not paid or otherwise resolved the $686 cellular-telephone service \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He explained his dissatisfaction with the billing and that he \nterminated his service as a result, but that does not relieve him of his obligation to pay \nthe debt. \nWhile the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f are not listed on Applicant\u2019s January \n2023 CBR, there is no record evidence that they have been resolved. Merely waiting for \na debt to drop off a credit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nApplicant has not paid or otherwise addressed the $40,308 balance due on a \nrepossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a). While his loss of income due to the COVID-19 \npandemic may have been the cause of his inability to pay his vehicle-loan payments which \nresulted in the repossession, a circumstance largely beyond his control, he has not acted \nresponsibly. His one telephone call to the creditor, which no longer had access to \nApplicant\u2019s account information, does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve this \ndebt. This debt comprises more than 72% of the total SOR debt.

Yet, he has not taken \nany action to address this significant debt. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. He has not paid or otherwise \nmade any measurable effort to resolve his over $40,000 delinquent vehicle-loan debt. His \nrefusal to pay his $3,908 dental-clinic debt due to his dissatisfaction with his braces and \nhis refusal to pay the $686 cellular-telephone service debt due to his dissatisfaction with \nthe company\u2019s billing practices does not resolve these debts. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply to the unresolved SOR debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Marine Corps from 2003 until 2015 and was first \ngranted a security clearance while on active duty. He also experienced an unforeseen \nreduction in income in 2020. However, his lack of any identifiable action to resolve the \nmajority of his delinquent debt outweighs the positive information in his background. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his ongoing financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file all his federal and state income tax returns when they were \ndue. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant went through a tumultuous period. He separated and divorced, moved \nto a new state, had back surgery, and went through the COVID-19 pandemic. Then a \nhurricane damaged his home. He also admitted that he should have been more diligent \nabout his taxes, but his personal life was in turmoil, and he just kept putting off filing the \nreturns. All the returns were filed in June 2022, before the SOR was issued, and all the \ntaxes were paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nI found Applicant to be honest and truthful. I am convinced that he has learned a \nvaluable and costly lesson, and that all future returns and taxes will be filed and paid on \ntime. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(GE 3) He elaborated on \nhis marijuana use in his September 6, 2022 SOR Answer as well as during his \ntestimony. The following summarizes that marijuana use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout January 1995 to about September 2021. He admitted this allegation with \nexplanations. (SOR Answer) He smoked marijuana occasionally in his early 20s, but in \n2002 he started a family and pursued a Ph.D. in electrical engineering that took him 13 \nyears to complete. Applicant did not use marijuana again until mid-2017 when it was \nlegalized in his state of residence. (SOR Answer) \nDuring his hearing, Applicant stated that he first used marijuana \u201cshortly after \nhigh school\u201d and did not use it in a consistent pattern.

It just sort of started surfacing through different social \nnetworks.\u201d It was \u201csometime, middle to the end of 2017,\u201d that his wife came home with a \nvape pen, \u201clike an e-cigarette.\u201d (Tr. 23-24, 31) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2016 to September 2021 while granted access to classified information. He \nadmitted this allegation with explanations. (SOR Answer) He added, \u201cto date I have \nnever been in possession of or had access to classified information.\u201d (SOR Answer) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife came home with an electronic cigarette in 2017, she told \nhim that it was a hemp-derived version called Delta-8 THC and was legal in all states. \nApplicant researched whether his wife\u2019s claim, as well as the same claim of a friend he \nplayed hockey with, was accurate and found the laws to be conflicting. He used the \nambiguity of the laws to justify his infrequent use of these products and began to use \nthem sporadically because, as a writer, its use would help him to write. He reiterated \nand acknowledged that was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d and stated he would not make that same \nmistake again. He only used these products with his wife or by himself. Applicant fully \nadmitted that he got it wrong. (Tr. 19-20, 24-25, 32, 39) \nApplicant told the investigator during his January 4, 2022 OPM interview that he \nplanned to continue \u201cto use this stuff\u201d because he had convinced himself \u201cthat it wasn\u2019t \na big deal.\u201d Applicant acknowledged this response was \u201cvery wrong\u201d and is \u201cvery \nremorseful\u201d for making that statement. He \u201cmis-understood the severity of the choice \nand how the Federal Government would see this.\u201d He credibly expressed that he was \nsorry and stated that \u201cit won\u2019t happen again.\u201d (Tr. 20) Applicant said that he last used \nDelta-8 THC shortly after his OPM interview, stating that he was \u201cthick-headed\u201d not \nrealizing the \u201cmagnitude of this.\u201d Shortly after his OPM interview, and \u201cmaybe eight \nmonths\u201d ago, Applicant stopped using marijuana completely. In his post-hearing \nstatement, he clarified that he had not used any marijuana products over the past year. \nHe added that it was not hard for him to stop using marijuana nor does he miss using it. \n(Tr. 25-27, 30; AE C) \nApplicant underwent a pre-employment drug test when he was initially hired as \nan intern. He stated that his employer provides training but does not recall any specific \ntraining on his company\u2019s drug policy. He realizes Federal law \u201ctrumps\u201d state law. He \nhas not undergone any random drug screenings since he began his employment in \n2006. (Tr. 27-28) When Applicant completed his November 3, 2021 SF-86, he stated \nthat he wrote songs and occasionally used marijuana to generate new ideas. He added \nthat if marijuana use became an impediment to obtaining his clearance, he would refrain \nfrom further use as he was not \u201cvery attached to it.\u201d He testified that he provided that \nresponse because he was mistaken regarding the state of the law and acknowledged \nthat he \u201ccould have made a better choice . . . and stopped right then.\u201d (Tr. 20-21; GE 2) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that his wife no longer uses marijuana.

Apart from a fellow hockey team player \nwho sometimes uses a vape pen, Applicant does not find himself in any situations \nwhere marijuana is used.

(Tr. 32-33, 39-40) Applicant submitted a signed statement of \nintent, dated January 29, 2023, to abstain from all hemp derived products regardless of \ntheir legal status at state and Federal levels. He added that he has not consumed any of \nthese products for the past year and is fully committed to maintaining abstinence. (Tr. \n33-34; AE C) Similarly, Applicant\u2019s wife submitted a signed statement, dated January \n29, 2023, expressing her committed support of her husband\u2019s decision to abstain from \nall hemp products. She added that she discontinued her use of all such products. (Tr. \n33-34; AE B) \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted an email referencing research he conducted \non the legality of consuming hemp derived Delta-8 THC. He stated that based on his \nresearch it was his belief that Delta-8 THC is legal Federally as well as in his state of \nresidence. With that in mind, he asserted that he did not violate his employer\u2019s zero \ndrug tolerance policy as his employer\u2019s policy only pertains to the consumption of illegal \ndrugs. Regardless, Applicant stated that he would abstain either way. (AE L) Applicant \nsubmitted a second email with citations and further discussion supporting his position. \n(AE M) [Note \u2013 DOD policy does not permit the use Delta 8 THC. See discussion under \nAnalysis section infra.] \nIn response and in summary, Department Counsel stated that Applicant made no \nreference to using Delta-8 THC when he completed his November 3, 2021 SF-86 nor in \nhis January 4, 2022 OPM interview. She noted that Applicant specifically referred to \n\u201cmarijuana\u201d and \u201cTHC\u201d adding that he expressed an intent to continue using it, even \nwhen he was not certain whether it was permissible to do so while holding a security \nclearance. She concluded that even if Applicant were to establish that he currently has \na reasonable basis to believe that the product he was using was legal and Farm Bill-\ncompliant, his use occurred while he had doubts about its legality and reflected \nadversely on his judgment.

He viewed \nthe outcome of this decision not only as being important to him and is family, but to the \ncountry as well. (Tr. 20) \nApplicant submitted a reference letter from his functional manager (FM), who has \nknown Applicant for the past five years, first as his technical lead and later as his \nfunctional manager. [FM described Applicant\u2019s projects, past and present. Identifying \nthese projects would in all likelihood provide information leading to the identify of \nprojects and parties concerned. Suffice it to say, the projects involved are of critical \nimportance and vital to the national defense.] Applicant has a proven track record of \nworking on highly sophisticated platforms and is the \u201conly member of [FM\u2019s] team that \nhas both capability and drive to address these efforts in the short time-frames that are \navailable on these programs.\u201d Applicant is assigned to multiple programs as a subject \nmatter expert.

He has been asked to obtain a clearance so \nthat he can employ his work on several programs.\u201d (Tr. 35; AE I) \nIn addition to his contribution to the national defense, Applicant likewise \ncontributes to his local community. He developed a passion for teaching while he was a \ngraduate student working on his Ph.D. He participates in a company-sponsored \nprogram to encourage young people to pursue careers in science and engineering. He \ndeveloped a curriculum and leads classroom laboratory sessions for elementary \nstudents in electricity, magnetism, and the fundamentals of circuit design. Applicant \nparticipates in career days where he gives presentations on exciting engineering \nprojects to middle schoolers.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(f) any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition.\u201d Applicant held a security clearance and did not have access to classified \ninformation, but did hold a sensitive position. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance \nadjudications.

Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether \nthe individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including \nby signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, \nin light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug \nuse while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 \n(SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA \nClarifying Guidance), ES 2021-01529, at page 2. \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his marijuana use \non his November 3, 2021 SF-86, and later during his January 4, 2022 OPM interview. \nWhile Applicant may have concluded that his use of Delta-8 THC products did not \nviolate Federal law, his use at the time while in a state of uncertainty raises a security \nconcern. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance.

Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred before he fully \nrealized the implications of marijuana involvement. As such, his marijuana use \n\u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies because Applicant acknowledged his marijuana \ninvolvement and substance misuse. He provided evidence of his actions taken to \novercome this problem, and he established a pattern of abstinence, including: (1) \ndisassociation from most of his drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nHis spouse also submitted a signed statement expressing her commitment to support \nher husband decision to abstain from all hemp products. She also discontinued all use \nand plans to abstain going forward. Applicant did not indicate he would disassociate \nwith others who use marijuana. Prong AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) is difficult to fully satisfy because \nmarijuana use is so common and, apart from his friend on the hockey team, it is difficult \nto know about whether he has other associates who use marijuana. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when\nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd.

Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was approximately \u201ca year\u201d before his December \n2022 hearing. I accept his post-hearing recollection of time elapsed versus the answer \nhe gave during his hearing as being more accurate. His history of using marijuana was \ninfrequent and sporadic. Using marijuana while holding a clearance is arguably of the \nmost concern in this case. Applicant explained that his decision to use marijuana with \nvarying frequency after it was legalized in his state of residence stemmed from a \ncombination of factors to include his uncertainty over the legality of its use, emerging \nsocietal norms, and a mistake in judgment. He cannot undo the past, but he intends to \navoid making the same mistake going forward. Applicant recognized that mistake, \nadmitted and accepted responsibility for making that mistake, and promised to adhere \nto DOD\u2019s zero drug tolerance policy. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. Applicant\u2019s self-reflection, change in behavior, and support \nfrom his family, friends, and associates, in addition to about one year of abstinence, are \nindicative of an individual who wants to right his course. The absence of evidence of \nmore recent or extensive drug use, and his commitment not to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture, eliminates doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment with respect to illegal drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s reference letters document that he is an individual who possesses \ncharacter and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluations reflect the caliber of \nperformance the contribution he is making towards the national defense. His \nperformance further reflects that his work behavior is not indicative of someone with a \ndrug problem. As an employee, he is viewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an \nindividual with integrity. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that future drug abuse \nis incompatible with his career and family plans and manifested a steadfast commitment \nto continue lifestyle changes consistent with total abstinence of involvement with all \nillegal drugs. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant volunteered the information about his marijuana involvement. His \nmarijuana involvement was not detected in a urinalysis, in a post-polygraph interview, \nthrough OPM interviews of his associates, or through a law enforcement investigation. I \nam satisfied that he will keep his promise not to possess or use marijuana in the future. \nHis history of marijuana use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing his demeanor, which \ncan most effectively be done by personal observation, overall candor on other matters, \nand reputation among his superiors and peers. Given the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground, his explanation for his actions, and his subsequent actions, I find his \ndescription of his history of past drug use and assertion that he will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future were sincere and credible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), \n26(b)(2), 26(b)(3) apply. Drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn his April 22, 2016 SF-86, Applicant stated \u201cno\u201d when queried whether he had \nillegally used any controlled substance in the last seven years. He answered \u201cno\u201d \nbecause when he completed that SF-86 he had not used marijuana for approximately \n14 years. He did not use marijuana until 2017 after it had been legalized in his state of \nresidence. In short, Applicant truthfully answered the question about past drug use and \ntherefore did not falsify his SF-86. The evidence does not support the allegation under \nthis concern. \nMy credibility assessment of Applicant discussed under Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Abuse, supra, is applicable under this section. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \nto be consistently credible throughout his hearing, even when doing so exposed him to \ngreater liability. I accept his statement that that he understood the gravity and \nimportance of being transparent. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that no evidence \nsupports this allegation, further discussion regarding disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions is not warranted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guidelines H and E is \nincorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is employed as a senior control systems engineer for a \ndefense contractor. He has worked on a number of major projects of critical importance \nto the national defense. I note that Applicant has demonstrated considerable \nperseverance by committing 13 years of his life to earn a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. \nHe has shown a similar commitment to dedicating his adult working life to the defense \nindustry since 2006. Application of the mitigating conditions as well as a whole-person \nassessment support a favorable adjudication in Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant self-reported his drug use on his most recent SF-86 knowing that such \ndisclosure could jeopardize his clearance eligibility. His recognizes that his choice to use \nmarijuana or Delta-8 THC is incompatible with DOD regulations and is committed to \nrefrain from all further use. He enjoys the full support of his spouse in abstaining from its \nuse. He recognizes that his decision to use Delta-8 THC even if \u201clegal\u201d is incompatible \nwith DOD policy and contrary to the direction he wants to take his career. While \nlegalized marijuana and its derivatives may have gained greater acceptance as a result \nof emerging social norms, Applicant understands that any future use would be cause to \nend his access to classified information. In short, his lifestyle changes since he stopped \nusing marijuana are significant, noteworthy, and eliminated any potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him. He has a history of stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. This level of support and self-introspection should \nensure his continued success. His wife and three children rely on him for financial \nsupport. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to remaining drug \nfree. He has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. \nHe was serious, candid, and credible at his hearing. His past, present, and future \ncontributions to the national defense are substantial, and far more important to him than \nrecreational use of THC. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClarifying guidance provided by the December 21, 2021 SecEA concerning \nmarijuana-related issues cited supra was particularly instructive in evaluating this \noutcome. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Answer, \nResponse, and Item 2 at 37.) He told the investigator in his security clearance interview \nthat he intended on using marijuana in future and did not intend to stop. (Item 3 at 4.) \nApplicant explained in his security clearance interview he did have a medicinal \nreason for using marijuana and detailed in his Response that he used marijuana medically \nafter a major surgery. (Item 3 at 2; Response at 1.) He also acknowledges he used it for \nnon-medicinal reasons. In his Response he stated he did not want to lie about his \nmarijuana use. He noted the prevalence of marijuana use in the U.S. and the trends \ntowards legalization in expressing his hope that an otherwise qualified applicant would \nnot be disqualified solely based on marijuana use.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n3 \n\n \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his Response, and elsewhere in the record \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \nany substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n (a): \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum \nentitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 DNI Memo) which \nmakes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this issue:   \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has cited the 2014 DNI Memo in holding that \u201cstate laws \nallowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do not pre-empt \nprovisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not bound \nby the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that individual\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 18, 2016).  \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise\nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access classified\ninformation or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs\nindicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not\ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility\nto hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant fully acknowledges his drug use and has \nstated his intent to continue to use marijuana. He has not provided a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd.

See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. Feb. \n23, 2018) (\u201cIt merits noting, however, that while several states have decriminalized \nmarijuana or allowed its use for medical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana \nremains subject to the applicable disqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because he requested a determination \non the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). \nI considered Applicant's admissions and explanations, including his explanation \nfor his medical use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s position on marijuana was clear concerning \nhis use of medical marijuana and his other reasons for his stated intentions to continue \nusing marijuana, However, marijuana use remains illegal under Federal law and for \ncleared individuals, so his marijuana involvement and stated intentions of future use are \nunmitigated security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraph 1.a:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On October 26, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The DoD acted under \nExecutive Order (Ex.

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on January 4, 2023.

Applicant did not submit a response or \nobject to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 4 and 5 are admitted into evidence. The case \nwas assigned to me on April 3, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nDepartment Counsel submitted Items 6 and 7 and asked that I take administrative \nnotice of relevant facts about Taiwan. Without objection, I have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written \nrequest and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note: \nThe United States recognizes the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging \nthe Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. \nThe United States maintains cultural, commercial, and other unofficial \nrelations with the people of Taiwan. The 2019 U.S. Department of State \nreport on human rights in Taiwan noted that there were no reports of \nsignificant human rights abuses. However, throughout 2019, Beijing \nadopted a more coercive policy toward Taiwan, seeking to isolate and \nintimidate Taipei into unification on Beijing\u2019s terms. Taiwan is an active \ncollector of U.S. economic technologies that have sensitive military \napplications. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s two grandfathers, uncle, two \naunts, and a cousin are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant admits each of these \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a through 1d). His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He was born in Taiwan. He has worked for a defense \ncontractor since August 2021. He came to the United States with his parents in 1999. His \nparents live in the United States and maintain dual citizenship with both countries. He and \nhis parents became U.S. citizens in 2010. He holds both  U.S. and Taiwanese passports. \nHis sister was born in the United States in 2000 and resides in the United States. He \ngraduated high school in 2015 and received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. (Item 4 at 14-\n15.) \nFrom 2014 through 2018, while he was a student, Applicant traveled each year to \nTaiwan during the summer months. (Item 5 at 10.)

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under \na foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The mere possession of \nties with family in Taiwan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nHowever, if an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). The totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at 11-12 (App. Bd. Oct. \n27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing \nTaiwan). \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nWhen foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. \n01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). Applicant discussed during his security clearance \ninterview and in his interrogatory responses his visits to his family in Taiwan.

There is no evidence his family has ties to the \ngovernment. Applicant has not traveled to visit his relatives in Taiwan since 2018 and his \ncontacts have become less frequent since he graduated college. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \nApplicant considers himself an American first, and at age 27, his retirement plans \nare several decades in the future. The relationships alleged are not immediate family \nmembers. His immediate family all reside in the United States. The record evidence is \nsufficient to mitigate the concern under AG \u00b6 8(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I weighed this consideration in reviewing Applicant\u2019s security clearance \ninterview, which was thorough, and affirmed by him in response to interrogatories. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his contacts with his family in Taiwan. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance.

The short-term-disability payments were significantly less than his regular pay. \nApplicant and her husband were dependent on both their regular incomes to pay their \nmonthly obligations, and the decreased household income caused them financial strain. \nAdditionally, despite having health insurance, Applicant incurred unanticipated medical \ndebts from giving birth to their second child in 2017. These combined factors caused \nApplicant and her husband to be unable to maintain three of their credit-card accounts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). They also became delinquent on their unanticipated medical debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g).

(GX 4; Response; GX \n6; GX 5.) \nThroughout their marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband was responsible for filing their joint \nfederal-tax returns. Applicant was initially unaware that her husband did not do so for tax \nyear 2019. Ultimately, Applicant prepared the 2019 return herself and filed it on February \n6, 2023. She did not owe any taxes. (GX 3; GX 4; Response.) \nApplicant timely filed her 2021 federal-tax return with a payment of $2,604. \nHowever, she owed an additional $9,621. She received notice from the IRS sent on June \n6, 2022, of the additional taxes owed and immediately contacted them. She entered a \nshort-term payment plan and submitted the first payment in July 2022. She made all the \nrequired payments and satisfied her federal-tax debt for 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) in December \n2022. (GX 4; Answer; Response.) \nApplicant and her husband began their divorce proceedings in May 2021, at which \ntime all their marital assets were frozen. She had custody of their two children and was \nprimarily financially responsible for all of their care. She did not have the financial \nresources to resolve any of her delinquent accounts. The final divorce decree was not \nentered until July 2022. (GX 3; GX 7.) \nThe final divorce decree delineates 10 marital debts for which Applicant was held \npersonally liable. Four of the debts assigned to Applicant in the divorce decree are SOR \ndebts. One of the listed debts is a medical debt owed to a creditor to whom Applicant \nowes two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). She contacted the creditor and in September 2022, \nApplicant received a letter from the creditor that contained an itemized statement of \ncharges for the 2017 delivery of her son. The creditor combined Applicant\u2019s two debts \nand the total remaining balance owed by Applicant, after insurance payments, is $2,331. \nThe other SOR debts listed in the divorce decree are the $4,122 credit-card debt \nowed to a home-improvement store for the purchase of a lawnmower (\u00b6 1.a); the $407 \ncredit-card debt owed to a department store (\u00b6 1.b); and the $777 credit-card debt owed \nto a furniture store for the purchase of a couch (\u00b6 1.c). None of the other six debts \ndelineated in the divorce decree have ever become delinquent. (GX 7; GX 5; GX 6; \nResponse.) \nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant stated: \nThe divorce awarded debts in excess of what I could pay off immediately. I \nhave contacted the collection agencies requesting itemized details and \nhave received only those for the medical debt related to my son\u2019s 2017 birth. \nI have a two-year plan I am working through to resolve the outstanding \ndebts including in the SOR. I prioritized debt to the government and current \ndebt pay-off over collection debt.

She understands that she is responsible for repaying her debts and considers \nresolving them a priority. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 4; Response.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues primarily arose between 2017 and 2019 when her \nhusband\u2019s income was not reliable and from unanticipated medical expenses related to \nher son\u2019s 2017 birth. These combined circumstances caused Applicant to be unable to \nmaintain payments on the three credit-card accounts and the four medical debts alleged \nin the SOR. Additionally, without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, her husband failed to file their \n2019 federal tax return.  \nWhen Applicant and her husband began divorce proceedings in May 2021, all of \ntheir marital assets were frozen. Applicant had the increased financial obligation of being \nprimarily responsible for her two minor children. When Applicant\u2019s final divorce decree \nwas entered in July 2022, the decree allocated 10 of the marital debts to Applicant \npersonally. With her increased financial obligations and no access to any of her marital \nassets, she did not have the financial resources to resolve the SOR debts. Additionally, \nApplicant was informed by the IRS that she owed approximately $9,600 for her 2021 \ntaxes. \nHowever, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Despite her \nhusband\u2019s fluctuating income and her significant medical bills, Applicant maintained the \nmajority of her monthly financial obligations including her mortgage loan, her vehicle \nloans, and numerous credit cards. Although her marital assets were frozen after filing for \ndivorce in May 2021, and she had the increased financial obligation of primary support \nfor her two children, she continued to maintain her ongoing monthly financial obligations \nand did not did not incur any additional delinquent debt. After her divorce was finalized in \nJuly 2022 and she was assigned 10 of the marital debts, Applicant prioritized how she \nwould repay or otherwise resolve the debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter learning of the additional amount of taxes due for 2021 in June 2022, \nApplicant immediately contacted the IRS and entered a repayment plan. She made her \nfirst payment under the plan in July 2022 before the SOR was issued. She fully satisfied \nthe tax debt in December 2022. Resolving her tax debt was Applicant\u2019s first priority. \nThroughout their marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband was responsible for filing their tax \nreturns. However, unbeknownst to Applicant until much later, her husband failed to file \nthe 2019 federal-tax return. Despite her lack of experience with the process, Applicant \nfiled her 2019 federal-tax return in February 2023. \nApplicant has contacted each of the six creditors of the SOR debts. She requested \nstatements from each creditor itemizing the balances due. She received a letter from the \ncreditor of two of the medical debts that are owed as unanticipated expenses for the 2017 \nbirth of her son. Applicant accepts responsibility for each of her remaining SOR debts, \nwhich total $8,601, and is determined to repay or otherwise resolve each of them as she \nis able. \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). While those granted \naccess to classified information are held to a high standard of conduct, they are not held \nto a standard of perfection. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant\u2019s financial habits are \nreckless or irresponsible or that she is likely to disregard her financial obligations in the \nfuture. She had executed repayment plan and begun paying the 2021 federal-tax debt \nalleged in the SOR, listed as $7,934, prior to the issuance of the SOR. She accepts \nresponsibility for her remaining delinquent accounts and has established a plan to resolve \nthem. She lives within her means and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(e), and 20(g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances.

After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her past \nfinancial issues.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with explanations, except for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which he denied. His explanations for the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d amount to denials, and I have considered them as such. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 26-year-old forklift operator employed by a defense contractor since June 2016. He has never married. He has served in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) since January 2016. His military job is culinary specialist. He received an Army Achievement Medal in March 2019. (AX H) He has held a security clearance since October 2015. (Tr. 5, 16; GX 10). He needs a security clearance to enter the shipyard for his civilian job. (Tr. 16) In 2014, while Applicant was in high school, one of his friends who was with him grabbed another person\u2019s laptop. Applicant and his friend ran away, but they were later detained and charged with felony larceny. Because Applicant was a juvenile, the felony charge was nolle prosequi, and he was placed on probation for six months and required to apologize and pay restitution. (Tr. 29-30) This incident was not alleged in the SOR. In 2015, while Applicant was still in high school, he was with a friend who started throwing rocks at a girl. Applicant testified that he did not throw any rocks, but he was charged with assault and battery and required to appear in court. In November 2015, the charge was dismissed on \u201crequest",

On November 18, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA \nCAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines E, H, and J.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n19, 2023, and the case was assigned to me on June 30, 2023. On August 1, 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on August 31, 2023. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nD, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until September 22, \n2023, to enable him to submit additional evidence. He timely submitted AX E through AX \nI, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 12, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations, except for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which he denied. His explanations \nfor the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d amount to denials, and I have considered \nthem as such. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old forklift operator employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2016. He has never married. He has served in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) since \nJanuary 2016. His military job is culinary specialist. He received an Army Achievement \nMedal in March 2019. (AX H) He has held a security clearance since October 2015. (Tr. \n5, 16; GX 10). He needs a security clearance to enter the shipyard for his civilian job. (Tr. \n16) \nIn 2014, while Applicant was in high school, one of his friends who was with him \ngrabbed another person\u2019s laptop. Applicant and his friend ran away, but they were later \ndetained and charged with felony larceny. Because Applicant was a juvenile, the felony \ncharge was nolle prosequi, and he was placed on probation for six months and required \nto apologize and pay restitution. (Tr. 29-30) This incident was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn 2015, while Applicant was still in high school, he was with a friend who started \nthrowing rocks at a girl. Applicant testified that he did not throw any rocks, but he was \ncharged with assault and battery and required to appear in court. In November 2015, the \ncharge was dismissed on \u201crequest of petitioner.\u201d (AX B) Applicant enlisted in the USAR \nin August 2015, but his active duty for basic training was delayed until the case was \nresolved. This incident was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn March 2017, while Applicant was on active duty, he attended a gun show and \nattempted to purchase a firearm. When he filled out the criminal consent form for his \nbackground check, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had ever been arrested \nfor a felony. He did not disclose his arrest for felony larceny in 2014. Based on this \nomission, he was charged with making a false statement on a firearm consent form. (GX \n5) In June 2018, the charge was dismissed. (GX 4 at 9) When Applicant was questioned \nby his platoon sergeant, he told him that he had misunderstood the question.

(Tr. 37) Applicant\u2019s USAR \ncommander was informed of the felony charge, Applicant\u2019s explanation, and the ultimate \ndismissal of the charges. His commander told the battalion security manager that he \nwanted to keep Applicant in the unit and wanted Applicant to keep his security clearance. \n(GX 10; AX A) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe admitted that he was charged with a felony, and he apologized for his negligence. \nIn September 2019, Applicant was charged with speeding 82 miles per hour (mph) \nin a 60-mph zone. The charge was amended to speeding 71 mph in a 60-mph zone, an \ninfraction. (GX 5 at 3) He pleaded guilty and was fined $66. This incident was not alleged \nin the SOR. \nIn October 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI) (1st  offense) and reckless driving. He was driving at night in the rain, and he ran off \nthe road and hit a light pole. He testified that he had not been drinking, but he failed a \nfield sobriety test because he could not recite the alphabet backwards. Two breathalyzer \ntests failed to detect alcohol. (Tr. 40-41) He went to trial, was represented by an attorney, \nand was found not guilty of both offenses. (GX 5 at 7) This arrest for DWI was alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and Applicant admitted it in his answer. The charge of reckless driving was \nnot alleged in the SOR. \nIn July 2020, Applicant was charged with driving 44 mph in a 30-mph zone, an \ninfraction. Disposition was deferred and the charge was dismissed in December 2020 \n(GX 5 at 9) This charge was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn August 2020, Applicant was charged with assault and battery involving his \ngirlfriend at the time. They began arguing while they were in his car. When they got out \nof the car, the girlfriend threw a drink at him and tried to slap him. He went into the \ngirlfriend\u2019s house to retrieve his belongings, and when he stepped outside, his girlfriend \nsprayed him with pepper spray. He pushed her away with the palm of his hand and hit \nher nose, which began bleeding, and she fell to the ground. He then left the scene. After \nhe was served with a warrant, he filed an assault complaint against her. Both parties were \nrepresented by attorneys, and they mutually agreed to dismiss both complaints. (Tr. 48-\n51; GX 3 at 7) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and Applicant admitted being charged \nin his answer to the SOR. \nOn a later date in August 2020, Applicant was in a restaurant with a female friend. \nThey had agreed that each would pay their own bill, but his friend left without paying her \nbill. The restaurant owner demanded that Applicant pay both bills, but when he refused, \nthe restaurant owner called the police, who charged him with restaurant fraud. Applicant \ntestified that he would have paid the entire bill if he had enough money, but he was \u201cin a \ntough spot at the time.\u201d (Tr. 54) He eventually paid it. (Tr. 55) He went to court on October \n7, 2020, and was found not guilty.

The reckless driving charge was \nreduced to exercising improper control. He was convicted of improper control and failure \nto obey a highway sign. The charge of evading a traffic control device was dismissed. He \nwas fined $25 for each of the two other violations. (GX 5 at 11-15) He testified that he \nwas driving through a very congested and confusing construction zone, and he drove \naround one of the traffic barriers. (Tr. 56-57) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and \nApplicant admitted the arrest in his answer. SOR \u00b6 1.e is not fully established, because \nthe failure to obey a traffic sign is an infraction, not a criminal offense. The reckless \ndriving, reduced to exercising improper control, was not alleged. \nOn March 22, 2022, Applicant underwent a random urinalysis administered by his \nUSAR unit that tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). (GX 7) In a sworn \nstatement he provided to his company commander, he stated that he purchased an \nelectronic cigarette (vape) from a gas station. He stated that he specifically asked the \nstore clerk if the vape he purchased contained THC, and he was informed by the store \nclerk that it did not. The information from the store clerk was incorrect, and Applicant \ntested positive for THC. (GX 8 at 5) \nIn June 2023, Applicant voluntarily provided a urine sample to his civilian employer, \nand the results were negative for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, and \nphencyclidine. (AX E) He was screened for drug involvement and was found to have no \nalcohol or other drug problem. (AX D) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in July 2020 he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \nasking if, in the past seven years, he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to \nappear in court in a criminal proceeding against him; if he had been arrested by any police \nofficer, sheriff, marshal or other type of law enforcement official; and if he had been \ncharged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in any court. When he was interviewed by \na security investigator in October 2020, he told the investigator that he did not realize that \nhe had been charged with a felony for his involvement in the laptop theft in 2014. When \nthe investigator confronted him with his arrest record, he told the investigator that he did \nnot list his arrests in his SCA because he did not read the questions carefully. (GX 3 at \n7-8) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he did not disclose his arrest record in July \n2020 because he misread the question. \nApplicant submitted another SCA in May 2022, and he answered \u201cno\u201d to the same \nquestion about his arrest record. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs, and he did not disclose his \narrest for DUI in October 2019. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed that he misread the \nquestions. \nAfter Applicant was charged with falsifying the criminal consent form in March \n2017, his commander requested that he retain his security clearance and remain in the \nunit. (AX A) Applicant received the Army Achievement Medal in March 2019 for \nexceptional service.

(AX G) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s co-workers states that he is a skilled forklift operator and a very \ndiligent worker. His work ethic and dedication are noted and appreciated by all the \nemployees working with him. (AX F) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made a false statement on a firearm consent form \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), was arrested and charged with DWI (SOR \u00b6 1.b), was arrested and charged \nwith assault and battery (SOR \u00b6 1.c), was arrested and charged with restaurant fraud \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), and arrested and charged with evasion of a traffic control device and failure \nto obey a highway sign (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is not established.

No disqualifying conditions are established under this \nguideline. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nJanuary 2022 to about March 2022, while granted access to classified information (SOR \n\u00b6 3.a, and that in March 2022 he tested positive for marijuana (SOR \u00b6 3.b) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline are: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is not fully established. The evidence establishes only one instance of \nmarijuana involvement in January 2022. Even though Applicant held a security clearance, \nthere is no evidence that he had access to classified information. A security clearance \nalone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain access \nto specific classified materials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to \nknow.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). \nSOR \u00b6 3.b is established by the evidence of Applicant\u2019s urinalysis that tested \npositive for THC. His urinalysis was conducted by his USAR unit. The 2019 edition of the \nManual for Courts-Martial (MCM) was applicable to his conduct. The MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 \n50.c.(5) provides that possession or use of a controlled substance is not wrongful (i.e., \nillegal) if it was without knowledge of the contraband nature of the substance. This \nrequirement of knowledge is also recognized in many civilian courts.  \nKnowledge of the contraband nature of the substance is not an element of AG \u00b6 \n25(b). Thus, I conclude that AG \u00b6 25(b) is established. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) \nare not established because the evidence shows that Applicant did not know that he was \nin possession of an illegal substance. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established because there is no \nevidence that Applicant had actual access to classified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 26(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d This mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s drug involvement was a \nsingle, isolated incident that gained his attention. He has a long record of arrests, but \nnone were for drug-related offenses. He did not know he had ingested THC until he \nreceived the urinalysis results. He realizes that any further drug involvement will cost him \nhis civilian and military jobs, and recurrence is unlikely. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b and 2.c allege falsification of an SCAs submitted in May 2022. SOR \u00b6 2.d alleges \nfalsification of an SCA submitted in July 2020. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying condition under this guideline is relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is not a neophyte regarding the security-clearance process. He \nsubmitted an SCA at some time after he enlisted in the USAR, and he received a security \nclearance. He completed another SCA in July 2020 in which he omitted information about \nhis arrest record. He was confronted with those omissions when he was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator in October 2020. Nevertheless, he omitted the same information \nwhen he submitted a third SCA in May 2022. His explanations for omitting the information \nabout his arrest record from his July 2020 SCA and May 2022 SCA are not credible \nThe fact that Applicant was not convicted of most of the offenses alleged in the \nSOR does not mitigate his falsification of the SCAs concerning the related arrests. An act \nof falsification has security significance independent of the underlying conduct. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-19278 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). The mitigation of the underlying \nconduct has little bearing on the security significance of the falsification, particularly where \nthere are multiple falsifications. ISCR Case No. 08-11944 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 15, 2011). \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct the omissions \nfrom his July 2020 until he was confronted with the evidence during his security interview \nin October 2020. Even after being confronted with his omissions, he made the same \nomissions in his May 2022 SCA. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications of his two SCAs are recent \nand serious offenses. Falsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart \nof the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those Guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the security \nconcerns under Guideline J and mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement) \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

None of the alleged \ndebts are over seven years old. The alleged debts became delinquent between 2020 \nand 2022. There is no evidence that Applicant has challenged the information reported \non his credit reports as being inaccurate or erroneous. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Here, the SOR alleged and the record supports a \nfinding that Applicant is indebted to 10 creditors for $20,430. The Government has \nestablished its prima facie case that certain of the financial considerations apply, \nspecifically: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating condition is partially applicable, but does not fully mitigate the \nalleged concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe record contains sufficient evidence to establish that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were caused by events beyond his control: job insecurity between July 2020 \nand October 2021; the death of his father; and the loss of household income due to an \nunexpected medical issue experienced by his cohabitant girlfriend. However, he did not \nsubmit evidence to satisfy the second part of the mitigation condition that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide any evidence that he has paid \nor successfully challenged the alleged debts. He also failed to provide evidence that he \nis no longer responsible for the debts either by cancellation by the creditors or \napplication of the statute of limitations. He did not present any evidence to show that his \nfinances are under control. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Although, security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection \nproceedings, an applicant is responsible for providing sufficient evidence to explain, \nrefute, or rebut the SOR allegations. Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production \nand persuasion. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On June 7, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on July 12, 2023. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1, 3, and 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

The debts \nalleged in the SOR include two loans to a credit union, multiple credit-card and consumer \naccounts, and several medical debts. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n and admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.o. His admission is \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old engineer technician employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. He has held a second job as a delivery driver for a food service \nprovider since August 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 2004 \nto March 2012 and received an honorable discharge. He was unemployed from April 2012 \nto May 2013.

Although the father of these four children provides occasional financial support for \nthem, Applicant and his wife are responsible for their daily living expenses.  \nApplicant and his wife purchased a home in February 2016, while he was working \nin a job that paid less than his current job. He and his wife began falling behind on their \ndebts and they began having a monthly deficit of about $1,000 per month. (Tr. 33, 37) \nAfter some point after Applicant and his wife purchased the home, they decided to \nhave a child. Applicant\u2019s wife became pregnant, but she miscarried at six months. They \ntried again, and their daughter was born in March 2018. (Tr. 18) His wife, who was earning \nabout $50,000 per year, stopped working after their daughter was born in March 2018, \nbecause the cost of childcare was about the same as what she was earning. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant testified that the minimum monthly payments on their debts kept increasing, \nand they knew it was only a matter of time before they would become delinquent.

(Tr. 51) They could not file their \nbankruptcy petition in 2018, because they could not afford to pay the legal fees. (Tr. 33-\n34) The petition reflects that the lawyer\u2019s fee was $2,600. (GX 4 at 60)  \nApplicant and his wife filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2022, \nmore than five years after consulting with the bankruptcy lawyer. Applicant testified that \nit took them a long time to save enough money to pay the bankruptcy lawyer because \n\u201cthat money would always kind of go to something else that would come up in the \nmoments that we would need to pay off during all that time, and it was a long time.\u201d The \npetition included the debts alleged in the SOR. They claimed their home, two vehicles, \nand various personal effects as exempt property. The petition listed Applicant\u2019s wife as \nthe sole owner of the home and two vehicles. (GX 4 at 20-22) They received a discharge \nin December 2022. (AX A) Applicant admitted that protecting his security clearance was \na major factor in his decision to file the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 47)  \nApplicant\u2019s current net remainder after paying all living expenses is about $1,000 \nper month. (Tr. 52) He and his wife drive two old cars that are paid for: an 18-year-old \nvehicle with 150,00 miles on it and a 16-year-old vehicle with 195,000 miles on it. (GX 3 \nat 11) They have only one credit card, and they pay more than the monthly minimum \namount. The payments on their home mortgage loan are current. (Tr. 49) Their monthly \nnet remainder after paying all their expenses is about $1,000 (Tr. 52) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admission and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts were frequent, recent, and did not \noccur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s decision to purchase a house that \nstrained their budget was not a reasonable course of action. When Applicant\u2019s wife \nbecame pregnant, it was not a condition largely beyond their control. It was not a surprise, \nbut rather a conscious decision. The record does not reflect whether the medical debts \nalleged in the SOR were due to conditions largely beyond their control. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ndecision to stop working was a reasonable alternative to the cost of childcare. However, \ndelaying the bankruptcy action for five years was an unreasonable and irresponsible \ncourse of action.  \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established.

A bankruptcy discharge is not a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d \nto resolve debts. See ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May 2, 2013). Furthermore, an \napplicant who waits until his or her clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may \nbe lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2017). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. I have considered that he served honorably and held a security clearance in the \nU.S. Navy for eight years. However, insufficient time has passed since his bankruptcy \ndischarge to convince me that his financial problems will not recur. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his history of delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph F (Financial Considerations):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

He asserted that, over the \nlast twenty years, he has either held a security clearance or undergone successful \nbackground investigations. Over that time, he has not had any disciplinary or security \nviolations. (FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes two conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBeginning in 2018, Applicant experienced significant financial difficulties. The \ndelinquent debts in the SOR, including federal student loans, multiple credit cards, a \npersonal loan and multiple cellphone and cable bills, are established by Applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadmissions and the credit reports in the record. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) \nThe Appeal Board has also stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a \ndebt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. \n21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of \nevery debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the \nfinancial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no \nrequirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThere are four pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2018, fearing the end of his employment contract, Applicant changed jobs and \ntook a salary reduction that caused financial stress. In January 2020, he attempted to \nrecover from those circumstances by contacting a debt consolidation company and \nsubmitting a DOE Loan Rehabilitation form to bring his student loans into good \nstanding. However, those efforts were hindered when his wife lost her job because of \nCOVID-19 related shutdowns. These events were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nStill, by the end of 2020, Applicant began addressing his delinquent debts. He \nhas since settled and paid five of his accounts. He has also made efforts to address his \nfederal student loans. Although he remains hopeful for some form of federal student \nloan forgiveness, he also submitted a DOE application to initiate an income-driven \nrepayment plan once the pause on student loans is lifted. Applicant sold his truck to \nmaintain sufficient funds to initiate payments on his student loans once applicable. He \nalso recently signed up for an online budgeting service that includes credit monitoring \nand debt payoff goals. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur, and they no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. He has issued payment on multiple debts and \nestablished a plan to address the remaining delinquencies. Additionally, he is prepared \nto issue payments on his student loans once directed to by DOE. Applicant has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-payment. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) also apply.  \nApplicant recently signed up for an online budgeting service that included credit \nmonitoring and debt payoff goals. He also enrolled in an online personal finance course. \nHe has a responsible plan in place for when he is required to address his federal \nstudent loans. AG \u00b6 20(c) is also applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has been consistently employed over the last twenty years and \npreviously held security clearances without incident. Beginning in 2018, fearing for his \njob, he took a new position that came with significant wage loss. In 2020, he began to \naddress his delinquent debts. However, he soon faced additional financial stresses with \nhis wife\u2019s job loss following COVID-19 related shutdowns. \nSince then, Applicant has paid and resolved several of his delinquent debts and \nestablished a plan to pay the remainder. He has submitted applications with DOE for \neither loan rehabilitation or the initiation of an income-driven repayment plan. He has \nbudgeted money to pay his student loans once directed by DOE. \nWhen compared to his long career, Applicant has shown that his recent financial \nconcerns are an anomaly. In review of the record evidence as a whole, I find that he has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant's eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from \nNovember 2008 to October 2013. He has worked for his current employer since May \n2018. He received a security clearance while on active duty in the Air Force. \nApplicant received an associate degree in January 2011. He married in June 2007 \nand separated in July 2020. He and his wife have no children. He testified that they have \nnever divorced, and they remain friends. (Tr. 32-34) However, his SCA reflects that their \nmarriage was \u201cdivorced/dissolved\u201d in July 2020. (GX 1 at 29) \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling about $43,179. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from August 2022 (GX 4), January 2022 (GX 5), and August \n2023 (GX 6). Applicant was interviewed about his debts by a security investigator on \nFebruary 4 and February 11, 2022 (GX 2). The evidence concerning the debts alleged in \nthe SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.h, and 1.k: student loans totaling $34,526. During Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity interviews in February 2022, he told the investigator that the loans were in \nforbearance while he was on active duty and that he made some payments when they \nwere due and then tried for another forbearance. He told the investigator that he had not \nthought about the loans for a while. (GX 2 at 5) In his answer to the SOR, he provided \ndocumentation that he had applied for consolidation of his loans into an income-\ncontingent repayment plan on November 28, 2022. He stated that the consolidation would \nbe effective on December 5, 2022, but he provided no documentation showing that his \napplication was approved.

(GX 2 at 10) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit\ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant has encountered several conditions \nlargely beyond his control: a marital separation, a short period of unemployment after his \ndischarge from the Air Force, and uninsured medical expenses. However, he has not \nacted responsibly. He accumulated delinquent debts because of inattention and poor \nrecord keeping. He did not begin to seriously address his delinquent debts until he \nrealized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant employed a debt-resolution service, but \nhe has not received the type of financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating \ncondition, and his financial situation is not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted evidence that the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.o has been paid in full, but he did not resolve it until he received the SOR and realized \nthat his security clearance was in jeopardy.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties of a financial analyst. She began working at her present job in June 2018. She previously worked for a federal contractor from 2015 until taking her current position. She was unemployed from May 2013 to March 2014. She earned hourly wages from $14 to $18 per hour from 2014 to 2018. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is one examination away from earning her master\u2019s degree. She is single, never married, and has no children. She provides regular monthly financial support to her elderly parents.

The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant \ntestified, but she did not offer any exhibits at the hearing. The record remained open after \nthe hearing, and Applicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-B, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 3, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with an explanation. \nHer admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof a financial analyst. She began working at her present job in June 2018. She previously \nworked for a federal contractor from 2015 until taking her current position. She was \nunemployed from May 2013 to March 2014. She earned hourly wages from $14 to $18 \nper hour from 2014 to 2018. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is one examination away \nfrom earning her master\u2019s degree. She is single, never married, and has no children. She \nprovides regular monthly financial support to her elderly parents. (Tr. 6, 19-20, 26; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent student loans totaling approximately $90,000. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e) The debts are established by credit reports from December 2021, \nJune 2022, August 2022, and January 2023; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) \nwith an investigator in December 2021; her answers to interrogatories in April 2022; and \nher SOR admissions. (GE 2-7; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after her student loan deferments ended in \n2014 shortly after she finished attending classes for her master\u2019s program. During this \ntime, she was either working low-paying hourly jobs or she was unemployed. She did not \nstart making an annual salary until starting with her current employer in 2018. She initially \nearned a yearly salary of $90,000 and is now making approximately $110,000. (Tr. 19-21 \nApplicant took out both private student loans and federally funded student loans to \nfinance both her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s programs. Her federal student loans have a \ncurrent balance of approximately $108,000, and are not at issue here. Those loans are \ncurrently in a deferred status from COVID-19 relief executive orders. (See: \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nstudent-loan-payments/) She claimed she made $300-$400 per month payments on her \nfederal student loans before the COVID-19 deferments. She did not provide \ndocumentation supporting her assertion. (Tr. 51-54) \nAs stated above, Applicant provides financial support for her mother (age 70) and \nher father (age 90). They live in a different state than does Applicant. She is the only \nfamily member in a position to help her parents. She started helping them financially in \napproximately 2019, and since February 2020, she has done so on a consistent monthly \nbasis. She estimates she provides between $400-$800 monthly. Her mother has direct \naccess to Applicant\u2019s bank account and will transfer or take out money when necessary. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nShe always informs Applicant when she does so. Between her own monthly living \nexpenses and what she provides her parents, she claims she did not make enough to \npay her private student loans. She looked into the possibility of hiring two debt-relief \ncompanies, but she could not afford the monthly payments each calculated for her, and \nso she declined to hire them. She admitted that she put her private student-loan \nobligations on the \u201cback burner,\u201d in terms of her financial priorities. She provided a \nmonthly budget that shows a $1,200 monthly surplus after all expenses. She also \nprovided a copy of an earnings statement. The budget does not account for any payments \nto either her private or her federal student loans. (Tr. 21-22, 31-32, 51, 56; GE 3) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 (Student Loans) 1.a-$22,105; 1.b-$20,160; 1.c-$19,368; 1.d-$17,312;\n1.e-$11,493. Applicant admitted these delinquent student loans. All five were originally \nassigned for collection between May 2006 and August 2008, and a more recent credit \nreport shows major delinquencies for all accounts between June and December 2019. \nRecently, they were bought by a collection agency, which approached Applicant with \nsettlement offers for all five loans in July 2022. Applicant admitted receiving the offers \nand provided copies of them. The offers expired in August 2022 without Applicant \ncommitting to them. She stated paying her student loans was not a priority in her life right \nnow. She has not entered into an agreement with the collector holding her private student \nloans since then. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 22, 29, 35, 57; GE 2-7; SOR answer; \nAE A1-A5)\n \nApplicant provided a character letter written on her behalf by a coworker who \nstated that Applicant is a great asset to their work team. She also opined that Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment make her worthy of holding a security \nclearance. (AE B) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s five charged-off private student loans were first assigned for collection \nback between 2006 and 2008 and are now charged off. She admitted not making \npayments on these loans either because she could not afford to at the time, or because \nthey were a low priority to her. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports establish the \ndebts. I find all the disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. She has made no efforts, \naccording to the evidence, to address these five delinquent student loans. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable. \nApplicant presented evidence that the debts were affected by circumstances \nbeyond her control, namely, her unemployment and underemployment, and the need to \nprovide financial support to her elderly parents. However, she did not act responsibly \nconcerning the debts, because she failed to resolve them in a timely fashion. Additionally, \nin July 2022, when given an opportunity to settle the debts at a much reduced rate, she \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndeclined to act on the offer. AG \u00b6 20(b), therefore, has some application, but does not \nfully apply. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. Her track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Based upon her past history and the \napproximately $100,000-worth of federal student loans that are currently deferred, there \nis no reason to believe that she will right her financial ship in the future, because she \npresented no viable plan to do so. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, her underemployment and \nunemployment, and the financial support she provides to her parents. However, I also \nconsidered that she has not adequately addressed her delinquent student loans. She has \nnot established a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to \nquestion her ability to resolve her debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 19-22, 25-28; \nGE 1, 3) \nApplicant has a history of tax problems, including not filing his federal income tax \nreturns when they were due for tax years 2016 through 2020 and not paying his federal \nincome taxes when they were due for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and \n2020.1 He retained a tax company in August 2022 to file his back returns and to \nrepresent him before the IRS for the taxes owed.

He \nstated that his W-2 and other financial documents were sent to her automatically. Since \nhe had not heard from his wife or the IRS, he assumed the tax issues had been \nresolved. Applicant\u2019s testimony was similar. He just assumed that his wife was handling \ntheir taxes, if the IRS had any issues they would contact him, and he did not receive \nanything from the IRS.

(Tr. at 24; AE \n1, 4-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unfiled tax returns, unpaid \ntaxes, and a charged-off credit card account.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant assumed that his wife was handling their taxes. He thought if the IRS \nhad any issues they would contact him, and he did not receive anything from the IRS. \nThat is irresponsible conduct. Additionally, he knew he owed the IRS for at least tax \nyear 2014 because he discussed it in his SF 86. He again ignored his tax obligations. \nHe retained a tax company in August 2022 to file his back returns and to represent him \nbefore the IRS for the taxes owed. All his federal tax returns have been filed, except for \ntax year 2016. His tax service wrote: \u201cThe IRS requires the past 6 years to be filed in \norder to be in compliance with IRS tax filing requirements and to be in good standing \nwith the IRS; therefore, we are not filing [Applicant\u2019s] 2016 federal tax return.\u201d He still \nowes the IRS more than $140,000 for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020, which does not include all the penalties and interest and what he would have \nowed, if anything, for 2016. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed tax returns. It does not apply to the unpaid \ntaxes and the unfiled 2016 tax return. Little mitigation is provided in security clearance \ncases when an applicant stands on a legal defense such as the statute of limitations. \nSee e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01231 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015). \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nApplicant\u2019s tax company is attempting to work out a payment plan with the IRS. \nHe stated that he will pay whatever he owes. However, intentions to resolve financial \nproblems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other \nresponsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the $20,271 charged-off credit card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), but he provided no documentation in support of a dispute. The debt is \nlisted on all six credit reports in evidence, including the most recent one submitted by \nApplicant. I believe the most likely scenario is Applicant opened the account in 2008, \ngave the card to his wife, and then disregarded the card, the same way he ignored his \ntaxes. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to that debt. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing, and \ncontinue to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules \nand regulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns is insufficient to overcome \nthe years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to file his tax returns and pay his taxes \nwhen they were due. None of the above mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered that Applicant \nhas worked in important roles supporting the U.S. military for more than 30 years, and \nhis performance evaluations reflect excellent job performance. However, he shirked a \nfundamental requirement to file his tax returns and pay his taxes when they were due. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except tax \nyear 2021, which is found for \nApplicant) \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Applicant is 41 years old. He is married and has three children. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 2009. He has worked for federal contractors since approximately 2010 and obtained a security clearance in 2010. He started a position with his current employer, a federal contractor, in January 2022. (Item 3) Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e- QIP) on January 19, 2022. In response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Records), Applicant disclosed delinquent credit cards and a personal loan that became delinquent in 2019. He explained that he used the credit cards and personal loan to finance a business venture that later failed. (Item 3.) On March 8, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During the interview, he discussed nine delinquent accounts. He explained that in 2017 he started a cryptocurrency (digital money) business. As he did not have enough money to fund the start-up business, he used credit cards and a personal loan to finance it. Initially, his business was successful; however, about a year later, in 2018, his cryptocurrency lost most of its value and his business became insolvent. He was then in debt about $45,000.

(Items 4, 5) The status of those debts is as follows: \n1. In 2022, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. filed a lawsuit against Applicant for $22,443. \nOn November 23, 2022, Applicant entered into an agreement to settle the debt for \n$11,000.

(Item \n2) \nTo date, Applicant has resolved $5,676 of the alleged debt, and he is resolving \n$22,443 of debt. Approximately, $29,000 of alleged debt remains unresolved. \nApplicant told the government investigator during his March 2022 interview that \nhis current income was $95,000 a year, and his wife earned about $25,000 a year. He \nsaid after he pays his expenses, he has $800 to $1,000 remaining each month, which he \nwas saving to resolve his debts. He said his employer and security officer are aware of \nhis financial problems. (Item 7) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s January 2023 CBR, he has 13 student loans, which he \nopened between 2005 and 2008. As of January 2023, the balance owed is around \n$104,000.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \n1In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education (DoEd) \nplaced all federal student loans in forbearance and has since extended the student loan payment \npause through June 30, 2023. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a \nsuspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collection on defaulted loans.

I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nTwo are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant accumulated $57,157 of SOR-alleged delinquent debts between 2017 \nand 2020, most of which he has been unable to fully resolve. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR-alleged debts started becoming delinquent in 2018 when his \nstart-up business venture in cryptocurrency began to fail. His debts were substantial, \ncontinue into the present, and cast ongoing doubt on his judgment. The evidence \nestablishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nWhile the financial market downturn affecting cryptocurrency may have been a \ncircumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control, his reliance on credit cards and personal loans \nto finance his speculative venture was within his control. He did not present evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances until sometime in April 2022, when he paid \none debt after he spoke to the government investigator about his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. Applicant has not participated in credit or budget counseling. In April \n2022, he resolved and paid the $5,676 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In November 2022, he \nreached a settlement in a lawsuit and began resolving the $22,443 debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. He said he is trying to resolve the $6,021 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. While there is \nsome evidence indicating that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are slowly coming under \ncontrol, that evidence is insufficient to establish significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant established minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) for the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. He did not initiate a good-faith effort to resolve the $22,443 debt until \nafter the creditor sued him. He did not begin to address the $5,676 until after he spoke to \nthe investigator. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n                      \n \n  \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult who \nis accountable for his choices and actions. In 2017, he started a financially risky venture \nusing borrowed funds that resulted in significant losses and delinquent debt within a year. \nWhile he asserts that he is reliable and trustworthy, his failure to begin demonstrating \nresponsible management until after he submitted his January 2022 SCA makes this claim \nless persuasive. He knew he was acquiring delinquent debts when his business failed but \nwaited almost four years to begin to address them. He did not submit a written budget \nwith sufficient details about his income and monthly expenses for me to determine his \nfinancial solvency and ability to pay his ongoing debts. He has managed to stay current \non $100,000 of outstanding student loan debt through the government pause and minimal \npayments. However, this pending additional debt load, together with the remaining debts \nalleged in the SOR, create some uncertainty about his ability to achieve and maintain \nfinancial stability and reliability. The likelihood of continuation and recurrence of financial \nconcerns, and the potential for pressure and duress, remain undiminished at present. \nApplicant has not established a reliable track record of responsibly handling his \nfinancial obligations. Overall, the record evidence does not resolve the concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering all circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nNational security eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on April 28, 2023, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.

(Item 3 at 44) \nThe SOR alleged two still-delinquent accounts, including the bank card, as set \nforth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a bank card account with an $800 credit limit that was \ndelinquent in the amount of $1,183 and charged off. Applicant\u2019s last payment was made \nin April 2019. (Item 7 at 2; Item 6 at 3; Item 5 at 3) In her March 2022 Response to the \nInterrogatories, she admitted that she had made no payment arrangements and was not \nmaking payments. (Item 4 at 2) In her January 2023 Answer to the SOR, she indicated \nthat the account \u201cwill be paid off after February\u201d after she files her income tax and receives \nher tax refund. (Item 2 at 5) She offered no explanations as to how the financial situation \noccurred or deteriorated, why she failed to address the situation since 2019, and \nsubmitted no documentation to indicate that the account has been paid as promised. As \nof the date of this decision, she has furnished no evidence to indicate that any positive \nactions have been taken by her. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a home mortgage account opened in December 2018 in the \ninitial amount of $178,730 for which no payments were made since July 2021. (Item 7 at \n2; Item 6 at 4; Item 5 at 4) A foreclosure sheriff\u2019s sale was conducted in May 2022, and \nthe redemption period expired without redemption. On December 15, 2022, attorneys \nrepresenting the lender gave Applicant a notice of eviction asking that she vacate and \nremove all her personal possessions from the property, or the sheriff would evict her. \n(Letter attached to Answer) Although the cited credit reports all indicate the unpaid \nbalance was $178,730, and the interrogatories state that the account was past due \n$17,660 and the total loan was $193,596, the SOR alleges that the account was past due \nin the amount of $30,028, and that there was a total loan balance of $202,468. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s only citation source for the alleged past-due amount is the SOR \nitself. Regardless of the amounts in dispute, a foreclosure did occur with anticipated \neviction. In the absence of any positive evidence by Applicant, I conclude that the account \nhas not been resolved. \nAs of March 7, 2022, according to a Personal Financial Statement, Applicant \nreported a monthly net income of $2,155.36; monthly expenses of $3,500; and an unpaid \nmortgage of $27,000. Considering those numbers and her negative balance, she had no \nmonthly remainder available for savings or spending. (Personal Financial Statement \nattached to Response to Interrogatories) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority \nto control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n3 \n\n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d   \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus \ncan be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such \nas excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is \nat greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent debts: a bank card and a mortgage foreclosure. \nApplicant acknowledged the delinquent bank card in her SF 86; acknowledged that she \nhad taken no positive resolution actions regarding the accounts in her Responses to the \nInterrogatories; and subsequently admitted both allegations. Based on those facts, as \nwell as the information in her Personal Financial Statement, it is clear that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand (c) have been established. There is no evidence to indicate an unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) is not established. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant offered no explanations \nregarding the cause of her financial difficulties; did not dispute the legitimacy of the debts; \ndid not indicate any ongoing contacts with her creditors or any efforts to resolve the \ndelinquent accounts; clearly stated that she had made no payments on the accounts; and \nmerely indicated that she would resolve the smaller account after February after her \nincome taxes would be filed. The record is silent regarding that promised action. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant ignored her delinquent accounts \nfor a substantial multi-year period. Because of her failure to furnish any explanations \nregarding her delinquent debts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that \nher financial problems are not under control or that she is not truly interested in resolving \nthem. Her inaction indicates that she has not acted responsibly. The Appeal Board has \npreviously commented on such a situation: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with \nthose financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained \ncontact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to furnish any verifiable evidence that she began \nmaking such efforts before the SOR was issued in October 2022, or even since that \nperiod. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered a generalized \nstatement regarding a future payment for only one account but failed to offer any \ndocumentation to verify the promised action.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. There is clear evidence that Applicant \nhas no monthly remainder available for savings or spending. Applicant\u2019s relative in-action, \nunder the circumstances, casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nfinial inspector since November 2014. She was previously employed by other employers \nas an operator; in assembly; and inspector. She was unemployed for approximately six \nmonths in 2012. She is a 2002 high school graduate.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. There is a bank card account with an $800 credit limit that \nwas delinquent in the amount of $1,183 and charged off. Her last payment was made in \nApril 2019. In her March 2022 Response to the Interrogatories, she admitted that she had \nmade no payment arrangements and was not making payments. In her January 2023 \nAnswer to the SOR, she indicated that the account \u201cwill be paid off after February\u201d after \nshe files her income tax and receives her tax refund. She subsequently offered no \nevidence that she had ever made the payment. There is also a home mortgage account \nopened in December 2018 in the initial amount of $178,730 for which no payments were \nmade since July 2021. A foreclosure sheriff\u2019s sale was conducted in May 2022, and the \nredemption period expired without redemption. In December 2022, she was issued a \nnotice of eviction asking that she vacate and remove all her personal possessions from \nthe property, or the sheriff would evict her. Applicant offered no explanations as to how \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe financial situation occurred or deteriorated, why she failed to address the situation \nsince 2019. As of the date of this decision, she has furnished no evidence to indicate that \nany positive actions had been taken by her. Applicant\u2019s inaction generates lingering \nquestions if she is currently in a better position financially than she had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or her] \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan \nfor the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on \nall outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. \nLikewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve her financial issues is \nnegative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f and 1.h. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old VTC engineer. (Item 3 at 7.) She has worked for her sponsor since January 2019. (Item 3 at 14.) She served honorably from 1997 through 2001 in the Navy. (Item 3 at 25.) She earned a bachelor's degree in 2005. (Item 3 at 13.) She divorced in 2000, and she has a 23-year-old daughter who currently resides with her. She has three siblings. (Item 3 at 29-30 and 33-35.) She previously held a Secret clearance in approximately 2001. (Item 3 at 42.) Applicant cites various life events in her Answer, including caring for her mother after her father's passing; her mother\u2019s move into assisted living; the hospitalization of her mother and daughter as well as herself; and the expenses incurred when the \u201cfamily dog fell ill and passed away.\u201d (Item 2 at 5).

She received it on December 8, 2022. She did not respond. The case was \nassigned to me on March 8, 2023. \nThe SOR and the Answer (FORM Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case.\nThe exhibit attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer on page 6 is also located on page 14 of Item \n7. FORM Items 3 through 7 are admitted into evidence without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f and 1.h. \nShe denied SOR \u00b6 1.g. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old VTC engineer. (Item 3 at 7.) She has worked for her \nsponsor since January 2019. (Item 3 at 14.) She served honorably from 1997 through \n2001 in the Navy. (Item 3 at 25.) She earned a bachelor's degree in 2005. (Item 3 at 13.) \nShe divorced in 2000, and she has a 23-year-old daughter who currently resides with her. \nShe has three siblings. (Item 3 at 29-30 and 33-35.) She previously held a Secret \nclearance in approximately 2001. (Item 3 at 42.) \nApplicant cites various life events in her Answer, including caring for her mother \nafter her father's passing; her mother\u2019s move into assisted living; the hospitalization of her \nmother and daughter as well as herself; and the expenses incurred when the \u201cfamily dog \nfell ill and passed away.\u201d (Item 2 at 5). Her eight delinquent debts total $30,158. The debts \nare established by her SCA, multiple credit reports and her answer to interrogatories. \n(Items 3-7.) The specific debts in the SOR are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due account charged-off for $9,178. FORM Items 4 and 5 show \nno change in the balance of the debt or its status. (Item 4 at 2 and Item 5 at 2.) In her \nApril 8, 2022 interrogatories she acknowledged the debt was not paid; payment \narrangements had not been made; and that she was not making payments. (Item 7 at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: past-due account charged-off for $3,709. FORM Items 4 and 5 show \nno change in the balance of the debt or its status. (Item 4 at 2 and Item 5 at 3.)

(Item 7 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: past-due account charged-off for $1,343. FORM Items 4 and 5 show \nno change in the balance of the debt or its status. (Item 4 at 3 and Item 5 at 5.) In her \nApril 8, 2022 interrogatories she acknowledged the debt was not paid; payment \narrangements had not been made; and that she was not making payments. (Item 7 at 3.) \nApplicant addressed three other debts in her response to interrogatories. A \ncharged-off department store credit card in the amount of $343. (Item 7 at 16-17.) She \nprovided evidence she had paid off the debt. (Item 7 at 16-17.) A delinquent medical \naccount placed in collection in the amount of $67. She provided evidence the debt was \npaid in full. (Item 7 at 15.) She provided an October 2018 payment agreement for another \naccount with an existing balance of $2,425, and an agreed upon payment amount of \n$1,335, with a monthly payment of $34. (Item 7 at 14.) This appears to be the disputed \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nApplicant completed a Personal Financial Statement as part of her response to \ninterrogatories. It showed a net remainder of $1,690 available to her each month for \ndiscretionary spending. (Item 7 at 9.) She lists her bank savings as $15,000. (Item 7 at \n9.) Her estimated salary in 2017 was $80,000 before taxes and insurance. Her biweekly \nMarch 2022 pay stub showed a net pay of $3,684. (Item 7 at 18.) She states she had not \nbeen making this salary in years and had other expenses to pay with the extra money. \n(Item 7 at 9.) \nApplicant in her Answer cites the statute of limitations on the various outstanding \ndelinquencies and her concern that any call or contact would restart the statute of \nlimitations. She explains that she did not want to risk a court proceeding that could put \nher government contractor job in jeopardy.

She states it was \u201cprobably not the \nbest idea to enter a debt consolidation program\u201d and cites her credit report and the \naccounts she has addressed to show her mitigation efforts and that she has not avoided \nher financial obligations. She explains that due to the age of the remaining accounts, she \nfigured she could get a better outcome on her own.

(Item 2 at 4-5.) \nApplicant states she does not talk about her financial obligations with anyone and \nall that her employer and coworkers know of her situation is that she had been taking care \nof her mother. (Item 2 at 5.)

(Item 2 at 4.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant's delinquent debts occurred under \nsuch circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. She listed various life events in her \nAnswer. She acknowledged she has been focused on current debts and not her older \ndebts. Her response to the interrogatories shows that her financial problems are not being \nresolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant cited unexpected medical \nemergencies to both her and her daughter; the death of her father; rendering financial \nassistance to her mother; and expenses incurred for her pet. She provided some \nevidence that she addressed three uncharged debts in her response to interrogatories. \nShe does not support her claim that she acted responsibly under the circumstances, \neither through payment or with legal action, with regard to the majority of her debts. Where \nshe stated she had acted or intended to act there is limited evidence of action on her part. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are partially established. Applicant engaged a debt \nconsolidation company and then withdrew from the agreement over a dispute.

See ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Without objection from Department counsel, I reopened the record and \nadmitted into evidence AE E. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 3, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since May 2018. \nHe has taken some college courses. He is married and has two children, ages five and \none. He has held a security clearance since 2019. (Tr. 5-6, 21, 26; GE1) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from October 2010 \nto June 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he used and purchased marijuana from about March 2019 \nto about 2021, while having access to classified information (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he \npurchased marijuana from January 2011 to December 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false \ninformation on his June 2018 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to \ndisclose his illegal drug use and purchases as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.c above. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) \nApplicant admitted all of his illegal drug use and purchases, and his deliberate \nfalse answer given on his 2018 SCA. He began using marijuana in 2010 and starting \npurchasing it in 2011. He used marijuana on a daily basis from 2011 through June 2021. \nHe purchased marijuana from 2011 through December 2020. He claimed that his use and \npurchase of marijuana was because he suffered from anxiety and using marijuana helped \nhim with it. He admitted that he was never diagnosed by a medical professional before \nMarch 2021 with anxiety. At that time, his primary care doctor prescribed him the drug \nEscitalopram, which is an anxiety medication, but he did not know if he was formally \ndiagnosed with anxiety. He originally took the medication once a day, but now takes it on \nan as-needed basis. He has never seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist about a possible \nanxiety disorder. He claims he has not used marijuana since June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-23, \n27, 29-31; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer) \nApplicant filled out an SCA in June 2018. In Section 23 of the SCA, he was asked \nif, within the last seven years, he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances.

He admitted his \nanswer was false. He answered falsely to conceal his past use of marijuana. He was \naware his employer had a drug-free work policy, and he signed an agreement to adhere \nto that policy. He was also aware that using marijuana violated federal and state law. He \nalso understood that he was granted a security clearance in 2019 based upon his false \nanswer to Section 23 of his 2018 SCA. He continued to use marijuana after being granted \na security clearance in 2019 through June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-27; GE 2) \nApplicant admitted that from May 2021 through June 2021, when he claims to have \nstopped using marijuana, he had access to classified information. He claimed he did not \npurchase marijuana during this same time frame. As of the date of his background \ninterview in July 2021, he had not disclosed his marijuana use to his employer. (Tr. 32\u00ad\n33; GE 3, p.6) \nApplicant completed and submitted a second SCA in June 2021. He admitted \nusing marijuana in this SCA beginning in 2010, with his most recent use in June 2021. \nHe also admitted using marijuana while possessing a security clearance. He admitted \npurchasing marijuana about once a week from 2011 to December 2020. He also stated \nthat he was now taking medication to prevent further use of marijuana. During his \ntestimony, he explained that the reason he decided to fully disclose his previous \nmarijuana use and purchases at that time was because he just had his second child, he \nnow had prescription medication to aid his anxiety, and he felt it was the right thing to do \nnow that he actually had access to classified information. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1) \nApplicant completed a 30-day inpatient drug treatment program beginning in \nFebruary 2023 and ending in March 2023. He followed that with a \u201cstepped down\u201d 30-day \nprogram from which he was discharged on March 31, 2023. All this treatment post-dated \nhis hearing in January 2023. The letter from the treatment program does not provide a \ndiagnosis, prognosis, or a treatment plan for Applicant. He participated in family \ncounseling where apparently his drug use was discussed. No further information was \nprovided and that counseling ceased in May 2021. His wife does not use marijuana, nor \ndo family members or friends with whom he associates. (Tr. 34-36; AE E) \nApplicant provided letters of support from two work supervisors and a personal \nfriend. Both of his work supervisors expressed the opinion that he was a respected \nmember of the team and presented no security issues. One of the supervisors stated that \n\u201cto my knowledge, he doesn\u2019t abuse alcohol or drugs.\u201d Applicant admitted that he did not \ntell either supervisor about his past drug use for fear that knowing that information might \nimpact their professional opinion of him. His personal friend wrote that he was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s prior drug use, but nonetheless believes that he does not pose a security risk. \n(Tr. 39; AE A-C) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\u00ad\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, between 2010 and June 2021 is supported by his \nadmissions and other evidence. His purchase of marijuana, between 2011 and December \n2020 is supported by his admissions and other evidence. He used marijuana while having \naccess to classified information from May 2021 to June 2021. There is insufficient \nevidence to support that he purchased marijuana during the time frame that he had \naccess to classified information. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply, except \nto the language about his purchase of marijuana while having access to classified \ninformation. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility, and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant used marijuana on a daily basis between 2010 and June 2021. Given \nhis pattern of use, his claimed abstinence beginning in 2021 is not sufficient to overcome \nhis prolonged marijuana use. Although he asserts that he will not use marijuana now that \nhe has prescription medication for his anxiety, he first saw the physician who prescribed \nhis anxiety medication in March 2021. He continued to use marijuana after that date. His \nclaimed recent abstinence is insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. The \nfrequency and recency of his past use, and his uses while holding a security clearance \nand, more specifically, after having access to classified information, and after he \ncompleted a first SCA in 2018 cast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26(b) apply. While he recently completed a drug \ntreatment program, he did not present evidence of a favorable prognosis by a qualified \nmedical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on his 2018 SCA. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he was granted a security clearance, gaining \naccess to classified information, and his failure to disclose his continued use of marijuana \nto his employer cause significant concerns. He was well aware of his responsibilities to \ndisclose his drug use in 2018 when he completed his SCA, but he failed to do so. He did \nnot make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous falsifications. Although he \nultimately disclosed his drug use and purchases when completing his 2021 SCA, he was \ngranted a security clearance in 2019 based upon his earlier false statements. Deliberately \nproviding false information on an SCA is not a minor offense. It strikes at the heart of the \nsecurity clearance investigation process. These actions raise questions about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Although Applicant claims he will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future, his credibility is suspect. While he recently received drug treatment, \nno prognosis was forthcoming and therefore, it is too soon to determine what overall \nimpact that will have. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s anxiety issues, \nhis recent drug treatment, and his letters of support. However, I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and his continued use after obtaining a security \nclearance. He also deliberately falsified his 2018 SCA, which resulted in him receiving a \nsecurity clearance. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except the \nlanguage, \u201cand purchased,\u201d \nwhich I find in favor of Applicant) \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 1) It is resolved. \nApplicant submitted two monthly budgets she established with Law Firm M. One \nwas drafted in September 2022 and the second one was drafted in November 2022. Her \nSeptember 2022 budget reported her net monthly income as $8,518 and included rental \nincome. It listed numerous expenses that totaled $5,661, leaving $2,857 remaining at the \nend of the month. Some of those expenses were a mortgage payment, a car payment, \nvarious insurance payments, transportation costs, a $150 payment to the IRS, payments \non four credit cards, and a $1,400 payment on her student loans per her contract with the \nLaw Firm M. (Item 1) \nApplicant\u2019s November 2022 budget reported her net monthly income as $2,735 \nand did not list any rental income. Her expenses totaled $979.

B at 13) Applicant did not provide \nan explanation for the large discrepancies between the two budgets. \nApplicant acknowledged that she has made financial mistakes by ignoring her \nfinancial responsibilities, which resulted in her debts becoming delinquent. She said she \ntakes responsibility for them. (Item 2 at 58) \nPolicies \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may be \nmade. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant accumulated over $136,000 in delinquent student loans that she took out \nbetween 2005 and 2008, which were charged off in 2015. She also accumulated about \n$7,500 in consumer and medical debts that became delinquent between 2018 and 2020. \nShe did not begin to address some of her debts until 2021. The evidence raises the above \ntrustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 sets out conditions that could potentially mitigate the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising under this guideline. Four potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s large student loan debt has been outstanding since 2015, with little or \nno evidence of steps taken to resolve it. In 2021, she resolved two credit card debts and \none medical debt, and in November and December 2022 her other five medical debts \nwere resolved. There is no evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) for her \nstudent loans and they continue to cast doubt about her judgment. There is evidence to \nestablish mitigation for the credit cards and medical debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to them. \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. Some of these circumstances were beyond her control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She did not provide evidence to demonstrate that she attempted to \nresponsibly manage her debts as they were accumulating or contacting her creditors. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nIn September 2022, Applicant again hired Law Firm M to help resolve her student \nloans. She apparently was financially unable to begin payments on that contract, which \nwas to start on October 25, 2022, and so she signed another contract with Law Firm M in \nNovember 2022, which was to begin on November 25, 2022. The substance of the two \ncontracts was the same, except for the starting date. There is no mention in either contract \nthat Applicant was required to participate in credit or financial counseling, and there is no \nproof that she did so outside of that contract. To-date, there is no evidence that she has \nmade any payment into the November 2022 payment plan, although she had an \nopportunity to submit additional evidence after receiving the FORM in December 2022 \nand having had until mid-January 2023 to submit some. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans are not under control or coming under control. There is \ninsufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) as to those \ndebts. Applicant submitted evidence that she resolved five medical debts and three \nconsumer debts, thereby establishing that those are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies to \nthem. \nApplicant stated that she earned about $125,000 in 2022. Her September 2022 \nbudget corroborates that income and listed common ongoing expenses such as a \nmortgage payment, utilities, credit card payments, etc. However, her November 2022 \nbudget projected an entirely different financial picture in terms of the amount of her \nincome and number of expenses. She provided no explanation for the large discrepancies \nbetween the two budgets, which created questions about her veracity and financial \nreliability that are the underpinnings of AG \u00b6 18. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Based on the evidence, including the large \ndiscrepancies in two budgets that Applicant submitted that are two months apart, and the \nlack of an established track record of responsible financial management, Applicant failed \nto meet her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under the guideline \nfor financial considerations. Continuation of her financial issues is likely, and the potential \nfor coercion or duress remains undiminished. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n    \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n              \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                     \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.i through 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

(Item 3; Item 7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $13,000 in delinquent non-student-loan debt. Despite her \nclaims that she was working to resolve her debts, she failed to provide any evidence that \nshe has contacted any of the creditors of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e, and 1.i \nto establish payment arrangements. Nor has she provided documentation to demonstrate \nthat she has resolved those debts or is not responsible for those debts. \nApplicant attended college courses between 2009 and 2015. Starting in 2017, she \nwas required to make student loan payments. She made approximately four $189 \npayments toward her two consolidated student loans in 2018; her last payment was in \nApril 2018. These loans total over $76,000. There is no evidence in the record that she \nmade any subsequent payments or contacted the ED prior to the enactment of the \nCARES Act in March 2020. It is very likely that her loans fall under the CARES Act, and \nher payments have been suspended since March 2020. However, the record reflects that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshe was almost two years behind on her payments prior to March 2020, and she has not \ndemonstrated a plan as to how she intends to make payments when the CARES Act is \nsuspended. \nI considered that Applicant is a single mother of three; however, the record is \nabsent any evidence of an effort by her to resolve her debts or prove that the outstanding \ndebts are not her responsibility. Accordingly, there is insufficient that she has acted \nresponsibly or made a good-faith effort to resolve her financial issues. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve her debts, large and small, indicates her financial \nissues are an ongoing and continuing concern. Therefore, her behavior continues to cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For the foregoing reasons, \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of proof and persuasion. \nShe did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish her \neligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant did not submit \nany response. The Government\u2019s evidence is admitted into the record. The case was \nassigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n, and 1.p), except for \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.o, 1.q, and 1.r. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since August 2016, as a supply technician. He holds an associate degree, a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and two master\u2019s degrees. He is married for the second time and has \none adult child. (Items 3-4). \nApplicant served in the U.S Army from 1994 to 2001. He also served in the Army \nNational Guard from 2002 to 2010. He was honorably discharged. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant incurred 18 delinquent debts, comprised of student \nloans and consumer debts totaling approximately $130,000 (of which approximately \n$100,000 derive from his student loans) (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.j, and 1.l-1.m). Two of the \nstudent loan accounts appear to be duplicates and I find in favor of Applicant on those \ndebts (SOR \u00b6 1.l is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.i and SOR \u00b6 1.m is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.j). \nApplicant admitted the 11 delinquent student loans of approximately $100,000 in \nhis SOR answer. He further stated during his background investigative interview, that he \nhad no reason to dispute these debts. A credit report reveals that his student loans were \nassigned for collection between 2010 and 2016. Applicant claimed the loans were put in \ndeferment for a period. He failed to provide any documentary evidence that he \ncontacted the lenders, set up any payment plans for his student loans, or paid any of \nthe accounts. They remain unresolved. (Items 2, 4, and 5) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed seven delinquent consumer accounts \ntotaling approximately $17,000. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 11.k, and 1.f-1.r) He admitted these debts in his \nbackground interview and in his SOR answer, except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q-1.r, which he \ndenied. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.r no longer appear on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report and \nare resolved for him. The remaining debts are reported as delinquent debts in credit \nreports from October 2021 and June 2022. He provided no documentary evidence \nshowing that he contacted the creditors, established payment plans, or paid any of the \nremaining debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has over $100,000 of delinquent student loans and failed to pay about \n$17,000 in other consumer debts. I find both the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and remain unresolved. He did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. He did not present circumstances that were beyond his control that \ncontributed to his financial problems and the evidence does not support a finding that he \nhas taken responsible actions to address his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \nstudent loans. He did not provide evidence of financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. His financial issues are not under control. He has not shown a good-faith effort to \naddress his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.r, but it does not apply to the \nremaining SOR debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his military service and \nwork as a contractor, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financial responsibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k, 1.n-1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m, 1.q-1.r: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

[Applicant] was forthright with his responses and \nalso indicated that he had not used any other illegal drugs, other than \nmarijuana and had never tested positive on any drug test. Given the \ninfrequent nature of [Applicant\u2019s] use over such a long period of time (over \n20 years) he could not recall the specific details of each use. [Applicant] \nwas also candid regarding his most recent use in November 2020. During \nthis time, it was over Thanksgiving weekend, and he smoked marijuana at \na family gathering with his wife\u2019s sister and her husband. This was a lapse \nin judgment on the part of [Applicant] and he has not used any drugs since \nNovember 2020, a period of over two (2) years.

His first marijuana \nuse occurred at a party in May 1995 when he was 18 years old. He did not recall \nspecific details of his marijuana use over the years given the time lapses between \ninfrequent use. Friends or acquaintances provided him with marijuana on the rare \noccasions that he did use it. (Tr. 25-27, 46-47, 56-58) Since he started working for his \ncurrent employer in 2009, Applicant estimated he used marijuana \u201capproximately once \nevery other year\u201d at social gatherings. (Tr. 28-29, 47, 56-58) Marijuana is legal in \nApplicant\u2019s state of residence under state law, but not under federal law. He does not \nhave a medical marijuana card, nor has he ever purchased marijuana from a \ndispensary. He did not reimburse any of his friends or acquaintances for the marijuana \nthey provided him. (Tr. 48) \nAs noted, Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred in November 2020. His \nsister-in-law, her husband, and children were visiting from out of town over \nThanksgiving weekend. Applicant\u2019s wife and her sister have \u201ca complicated relationship\u201d \nand had \u201ca pretty intense argument\u201d in front of the children on Thanksgiving Day. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws had marijuana in their possession that they had legally purchased \nfrom a dispensary. On the Saturday evening after Thanksgiving, the four adults smoked \nmarijuana after the children had gone to bed. Applicant \u201cunfortunately\u201d did not think \nabout his clearance at the time of consumption. He had not worked on any classified \nprojects up until that point. (Tr. 29-32) \nApplicant has not been offered any marijuana since November 2020 and has no \nintention of using marijuana in the future. Since then, Applicant has not been in any \nenvironment where drugs were involved. He understands holding a clearance is a \nprivilege and understands that those who are extended that privilege are required to \nabide by all the rules and regulations. He further understands that clearance holders are \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequired to abide by all the rules and regulations outside of work as well.

I have a much \u2013 much firmer understanding of the \nconsequences of what \u2013 of what doing that kind of thing will do. It will be \ndetrimental to my career. It will be detrimental to my ability to provide for \nmy family. Furthermore, I am on a program right now where I do access \nclassified information on a need-to-know basis. The responsibilities that \nyou just outlined that come with the privilege of having a security \nclearance, I guess they are \u2013 they are in the forefront of my mind each \nand every single day. I \u2013 I am reminded on a daily basis that I am \naccessing classified information, that I have a responsibility to safeguard \nthat information, so nothing to \u2013 I just simply don\u2019t want to do anything that \ncould in any way, shape or form jeopardize my ability to continue growing \nin my current career path. (Tr. 34) \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not use marijuana. She fully supports his abstinence from \nmarijuana. He does not have any friends or acquaintances who use marijuana. If any of \nhis friends or acquaintances ever did offer him marijuana, his answer would be a firm \nhard, \u201cNo. Please keep it away from me.\u201d (Tr. 48-49, 55-56) He understands that even \nthough marijuana is legal in his state of residence, its possession and use are illegal \nunder federal law. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant was queried regarding an October 18, 1999 subject interview \nstatement in which he stated that he had no intentions of using illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He was 22 years old in October 1999. (Tr. 35-36, 56; GE 5) He confirmed his \ntestimony that he does not intend to use drugs in the future and explained the difference \nbetween \u201cthen and now\u201d: \nA couple of things (are different). Number one, I just received a \u2013 received \na promotion where I am supporting a classified program. I \u2013 again, I\u2019m \naccessing classified information on a daily basis. In order to keep my job, I \nneed to be granted a Top Secret clearance to get to my next caveat [sic] \nof \u2013 of program \u2013 level clearance. The consequences of \u2013 the \nconsequences of not doing that \u2013 that transgression of smoking marijuana \ncould cause or just \u2013 it\u2019s just too great of a price to pay. It\u2019s not \u2013 it is \nabsolutely positively, no way worth the risk.  \nOther thing that has changed between then and now, I am married. I now \nhave a family. I\u2019m the sole breadwinner of my family. So providing income \nfor my wife and three children is probably my \u2013 my number one priority in \nlife and doing anything to jeopardize my ability to do that is not something \nI\u2019m willing to do, especially something like smoking marijuana.  \nI think the other \u2013 the other thing that has changed since 1999 to today, \nthis whole experience, reading the Statement of Reasons, hiring you, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncoming into this courtroom for this \u2013 this hearing today, I have an \nabsolutely crystal clear understanding of what the consequences of that \u2013 \nof those actions are going to be, I think.

To be frank with you. (Tr. 36-37) \nApplicant affirmed that he has grown as an individual over the past 30 years and \nlearned from his past mistakes. (Tr. 37-38) His November 2020 use of marijuana \noccurred as a result of a stressful family situation. Since then, he has adopted a more \ndisciplined approach to physical exercise, that he has \u201cfound is probably my single best \nthing I do to help cope with stress,\u201d and spends more time with his children. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant submitted a signed, sworn, statement of intent, dated November 11, \n2022, to avoid any future drug use or other illegal drugs both presently and in the future, \nwith the understanding that any drug violation will result in the automatic revocation of \nclearance. (Tr. 39-40; AE I) He completed a four-hour drug and alcohol awareness \nclass on December 9, 2022, a four-hour behavior modification class on December 10, \n2022, and a four-hour marijuana education class on December 10, 2022. (Tr. 40-41; \nAE K - AE M) A highly credentialed licensed psychologist (LP) completed a \ncomprehensive substance abuse evaluation of Applicant. LP\u2019s summary of the \npsychological evaluation, dated December 14, 2022, states in part: \nIt appears, however, that the Top Secret investigative process gave \n[Applicant] pause to reflect on his marijuana use. He took time to process \nthe matter in an intentional mindful way that brought him to new insight \nabout it. He then acted by disclosing his past drug use despite the \npossible consequences for his career. As the process progressed to an \nSOR, the gravity of the situation seems to have set in for him. In colloquial \nterms, [Applicant] is sufficiently \u201cfreaked out\u201d by the potential loss of his \nclearance, his job, and his financial security that it now seems exceedingly \nunlikely he will ever use marijuana again.  \nCONCLUSION: Based on all the available data, [Applicant] does not have \nany substance use condition or behavioral tendencies that could impact \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in the context of safeguarding \nclassified information or working in a cleared setting. (Tr. 41-42; AE N, AE \nO) \nApplicant submitted negative drug tests for urine samples collected on December \n6, 2022, December 20, 2022, February 13, 2023, February 28, 2023, and March 13, \n2023. (AE J, AE O) Applicant has never been disciplined by his employer. He considers \nhimself to be an honest and trustworthy person with high moral character. He does not \nconsider himself to be a threat to national security and could not be coerced into \ndivulging national security secrets based on the SOR allegations.

Those reviews document sustained superior performance and rate him as a \u201ctop \nperformer.\u201d Management views him as a subject matter expert and placed him in \nleadership roles and positions of responsibility. Applicant is a trusted employee within \nhis company as well as with his company\u2019s customer base. (AE H) \nApplicant was awarded a global credential in project management professional \ncertificate on December 15, 2017. He was also awarded a professional certificate in \nproject management by a state university on December 13, 2018, for having completed \na curriculum of 210 hours of study. (AE G) \nApplicant submitted six work-related reference letters from managers and \ndirectors or former directors in his employer\u2019s corporation. All of these individuals are or \nwere senior company executives. They have worked with Applicant and know him well. \nThey are also familiar with his SOR allegation and self-reported marijuana use. The \ncollective sense of these letters conveys a number of positive attributes, to include his \nintegrity, trustworthiness, work ethic, value to the company, contribution to the national \ndefense, dedication, and valuable service. These individuals fully support the \ncontinuation and upgrade of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (AE C, AE P; Tr. 58-61) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(f) any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nposition.\u201d The record established these two disqualifying conditions. Further review is \nrequired. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance \nadjudications. The SecEA memorandum states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. \nRelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions. (Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning \nMarijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA Clarifying \nGuidance), ES 2021-01529, at page 2.)  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n/on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) is appropriate and mitigating. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd.

Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd.

May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s self-reported marijuana use of approximately two dozen times spanned a \n25-year period from 1995 to 2020, to include use after being granted a Secret clearance \nin 2011. Appellant volunteered the information about his marijuana involvement. His \nmarijuana involvement was not detected in a urinalysis, in a post-polygraph interview, \nthrough OPM interviews of his associates, or through a law enforcement investigation. I \nam confident that he will keep his commitment not to possess and or use marijuana in \nthe future. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. He recognizes the importance of being a responsible family \nmember and employee, and that his actions can affect others. He also fully recognizes \nthat there is no room for any drug use while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nself-reflection, change in behavior, and support from his family, friends, and associates, \nin addition to his 27 months of abstinence, are indicative of an individual who wants to \nright his course. The absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his \npromise not to use illegal drugs in the future eliminate doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal \ndrug use. Applicant\u2019s statements are further corroborated by a comprehensive and \nthorough drug and alcohol assessment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists three ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. Applicant has engaged in a significant amount of self-\nreflection regarding his behavior and recognizes that such behavior is incompatible with \nholding a security clearance. Applicant has committed to disassociation from drug-using \ncontacts and avoiding any environment where drugs are used. Lastly, he provided a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s reference letters document that he is an individual who possesses \ncharacter and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluations reflect the caliber of \nthe contribution he is making as an employee. His performance further reflects his work \nbehavior is not indicative of someone with a drug problem. As an employee, he is \nviewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an individual with integrity. At his hearing \nApplicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with his future career \nand family plans, and manifested a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes \nconsistent with total abstinence of involvement with all illegal drugs. \nI evaluated Applicant\u2019s credibility after assessing his demeanor, overall candor on \nother matters, and reputation among his superiors and peers.

Drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guideline H is incorporated \nin this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is now willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted with a \nsecurity clearance. He honestly and voluntarily self-reported his infrequent past drug use \nknowing that such disclosure could jeopardize his clearance eligibility and future \nemployment. Applicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him and vouch for his \ntrustworthiness. He has a history of stable employment and a strong work ethic. This \nlevel of support and self-introspection makes his continued success more likely. \nApplicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to remaining drug free. He \nhas multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He was \nserious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He cooperated fully during his background \ninvestigation and provided truthful information throughout the security clearance \nprocess. I find that Applicant has learned from this experience and is committed to \nremaining drug-free. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \n     (a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant has established a long history of \npurchasing, possessing, and using of marijuana in violation of state and federal law. His \nactions raise questions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. He has not provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. He has sought approval as a current \nmedical marijuana user. In ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd.

See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 23, 2018) (\u201cIt merits noting, however, that while several states have decriminalized \nmarijuana or allowed its use for medical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana \nremains subject to the applicable disqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d) Because he \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003).  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant's admissions and \nexplanations, along with the medical explanation. Applicant\u2019s position on marijuana was \nclear concerning his use of medical marijuana and the reasons for its use. However, \nmarijuana remains illegal under Federal law and for cleared individuals. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Up to that point, I hadn\u2019t heard anything \nfrom the IRS. Once the tax company started doing their initial inquiries, I \nwas bombarded with letters from the IRS.

I have worked with a few different tax help companies, at one \npoint I retained a tax lawyer and finally I am working with a CPA who I feel \ndeals with me in an honest fashion. Over the last four years, I have agreed \nto two separate payment arrangements with the IRS to where the money \nwould automatically be debited from my account and both times, no money \nwas debited and no contact was made in regards to updating the situation. \nThe [IRS] payment arrangement in July 2020 was uploaded through the \ntax company website so I don\u2019t have a copy.

It \nwas not, however, countersigned or approved by the IRS. Applicant did not submit the \nJuly 2020 payment arrangement with the IRS mentioned above, because he could not \nfind it. (Tr. 59.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about SOR \u00b6 1.a was consistent with his Answer about that \nallegation. On September 20, 2018, he hired a tax help company (Company A), when he \ndiscovered how bad his federal tax situation had gotten while he was overseas. He \nattributed part of that to his going through a divorce in 2014 to 2015. Before he hired \nCompany A, he had not received any notices from the IRS. It was not until late 2018 or \nearly 2019 that he began receiving notices from the IRS. His agreement with Company A \nwas for him to pay the company $6,000 ($300 per month) plus a $28 per month fee in \ninstallments for its assistance in resolving his federal tax issues. Company A does not \nhandle state tax issues. (Tr. 33-40, 56; AE B.) His bank records show a total of $6,945 \nand a total of $588 in fees paid to Company A or its affiliates from September 2018 \nthrough February 2020. (AE A.) He never fired Company A and made all payments under \nthe agreement. (Tr. 61-62.) This contradicts later testimony that he fired Company A in \nMarch 2022. (Tr.78.) \nApplicant testified that Company A began filing his late returns in January 2019 for \ntax years 2010 to 2018. (Tr. 39-41.) His tax transcripts show that his returns for tax years \n2012 through 2015 were filed on March 25, 2019. His returns for tax years 2017 and 2016 \nwere filed on January 7, 2019 and March 4, 2019, respectively. (GE 3.) On May 10, 2023, \nhe hired a new accountant (CPA B) who filed his 2021, 2022 taxes, and will file his 2023 \ntaxes. (Tr. 78; AE I.) \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits AE D, E, F, G, and H, chronicle Applicant\u2019s efforts from August \n2019 to January 2022 to prod Company A, and in turn the IRS, to address his sizeable \ntax delinquency. The following are salient excerpts from those exhibits (quotations are \nfrom Company A emails to Applicant): \n \n\u201cI was told [by IRS] that due to the balance ($338,301.53), it must be assigned to \na Revenue Officer. This can take 1-4 months. The good news is, collection action should \nstop while in this process.

Please print, sign and either scan or fax the form \nback to me at the fax number below.\u201d (AE H 1/11/22.) This is the Installment Agreement \nApplicant signed and dated on January 20, 2022, and attached to his Answer. This \nInstallment Agreement is the last communication of record between him and the IRS via \nCompany A. The IRS has not yet approved or disapproved the Installment Agreement he \nsigned, dated, and returned to Company A in January 2022. Nor has it assigned a \nRevenue Officer. \nPending a response from the IRS, Applicant has filed his federal income taxes \nthrough CPA B. He is current on all his federal income taxes through 2022. To be sure \nthat he is owed a refund each year, he does not take any exemptions or deductions he \ncould otherwise take. That way, he always has a refund that the IRS takes to apply to \nback taxes. (Tr. 71-72.) CPA B has also advised him to do an offer in compromise, and \nthat is Applicant\u2019s goal now, while awaiting the IRS to act on his January 2022 Installment \nAgreement or assign a Revenue Officer. . \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.b, his delinquent state tax of $15,000, Applicant responded: \u201cThis is \nthe same situation as subparagraph a. In order to make a payment arrangement with the \nState . . . , I\u2019ve been advised to work with the IRS first as it takes precedence.\u201d (Answer.) \nApplicant testified that he spoke with a tax preparer in that State who calculated \nthat Applicant owed $15,000 for tax years 2010 to 2015. He filed those returns in 2020. \nHe was advised by Company A that he should wait until the IRS issue has been resolved \nbefore paying the state taxes. (Tr. 74-75.) His plan is to work on an offer in compromise \nwith the IRS, and if that gets resolved, do a payment plan with the State. The $15,000 is \nsomething he can afford. He is not opposed to paying the State first, but that is not what \nhis financial advisors told him. Even the State told him to take care of the IRS first. (Tr. \n76-77.) \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.c, a debt to DOD for $930, Applicant responded: \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure \nbut I think it\u2019s for a set of body armor that I signed for when I first deployed to Afghanistan \nin 2010 as a civilian contractor.

I still have the armor packed and cleaned and ready to turn in.\u201d (Answer.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was consistent with his Answer. This happened about 10 years ago. \nHe has no contacts in the United States to return the gear to. (Tr. 79-84.) The credit report \ndoes not provide a name or a phone number for the collection agency, just an address. \nThe creditor is DOD. The debt was assigned to collections in February 2012. (GE 4.) \nApplicant testified about his personal finances. He reviewed his Personal Financial \nStatement (PFS) (GE 3) and thought it was about accurate. (Tr. 86.) His PFS had a net \nmonthly remainder of $1,535. (GE 3.) His testimony updated that to $1,134. (Tr. 89.) His \njob ($6,000 per month) and a Veterans Administration payment ($150 per month) are his \nonly sources of income. (Tr. 84-85.) He has not taken any vacation since perhaps 2013. \n(Tr. 99.) He has no savings account. (Tr. 90-91.) He uses his checking accounts to pay \nrent and other expenses. At the end of the month, those accounts are about $300 to $400 \nfor expenses and $150 for rent. (Tr. $90-91.) His employer deposits $1.00 per month into \na 401 (k); he has never chosen one or filled out any paperwork for one. (Tr. 90.) \nGiven Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder of $1,134, Department Counsel asked \nwhether even if he had an IRS installment plan like the January 2022 proposed plan \n(calling for $2,250 per month), it was not his intention to make those payments. He \nresponded: \nNo, it was my absolute intention to make those payments. I told \nCompany A that . . . I can\u2019t keep this up. I mean, I\u2019m going to keep it up for \nas long as I can, but at some point the wheels are going to fall off. . . \nCompany A said let go of all my external payments . . . don\u2019t pay your credit \ncards . . . don\u2019t pay your storage . . . don\u2019t pay your medical expenses . . . \neverything outside of like rent and food . . . goes to the IRS . . . [That] \nwouldn\u2019t have been sustainable, because that wouldn\u2019t be good for a \nclearance. I mean, it\u2019s the same thing, I\u2019d still be hurting somewhere else. \n(Tr. 95-96.) \nApplicant clarified Company A\u2019s role. He hired them to file his late federal returns. \nThey helped him file those returns. He did not hire them to pay his debt to the IRS. He \ndid not hire them to handle his state taxes. (Tr.104-105.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . or pay annual Federal, state or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (f) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s financial woes had \ntheir inception during his overseas deployments from 2010 to 2014, during which time he \nadmittedly failed to track his taxes. That is quite some time ago, but his tax arrearages \nfrom those years of neglect continue to this day and are not fully resolved. That is, they \nare recurring. Those delinquencies are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two requirements. \nFirst, the conditions causing financial problems must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an \napplicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the \nadverse circumstances he confronted. \nIn addition to not tracking his taxes while overseas, Applicant noted his 2014 to \n2015 divorce as a factor. He also noted the slow pace of the IRS and the onset of Covid \nas factors. Those two were beyond his control. The initial circumstances that caused \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems, failure to track his taxes, was largely of his own making. The \ncurrent situation is not, however, just the historic cause of his tax difficulties. It is the \nseemingly immutable stalemate that the IRS has imposed by remaining silent about his \nproposed payment agreement and the agency\u2019s delay in appointing a Revenue Officer to \nhis case. Key were his divorce, the slow pace of the IRS, and Covid. Those were the \ncurrent circumstances largely beyond his control. \nHere, his actions after he discovered his tax thicket were commendable. Before he \napplied for a security clearance in January 2019, in September 2018, he hired Company \nA to advise him and to file his late federal tax returns. This was accomplished by Company \nA filing his late tax returns from January 2019 to March 2019. He successfully undertook \nthat effort before the SOR was issued in August 2022. CPA B then filed his 2021 and \n2022 taxes, and he is now current on all his federal income taxes through 2022. This is \nresponsible conduct, giving him credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe most difficult part of Applicant\u2019s case is his inability to defray any of his \n$368,213 delinquent income taxes, fees, and penalties. In January 2022, via Company \nA, he proposed an installment agreement to the IRS, whereby he would pay $2,250 per \nmonth beginning in March 2022 to retire this arrearage. From August 2019 to January 20, \n2022, when he submitted his proposed installment plan to the IRS, the agency has not \nresponded at all to Company A\u2019s inquiries about his proposal or to the agency\u2019s numerous \npromises to assign a Revenue Officer to his case. It has simply held up any collection \nactions. Applicant\u2019s tax fate is, therefore, in a legal limbo with no end in sight. \nIn the meantime, he continues to file his income tax returns and makes sure that \nhe has a refund that the IRS can intercept to apply to his arrearage. Now it matters little \nwhether he could make his proposed payments. His testimony was that he would do his \nbest for as long as he could. What matters is that his case be assigned to a Revenue \nOfficer to bring the IRS\u2019s considerable resources and expertise to bear on his thorny tax \nissue. As a fallback, he and CPA B are working on an offer in compromise to submit to \nthe IRS. He had a plan and has taken steps to accomplish it. His efforts to engage the \nIRS have been steady and in good faith, and his testimony was honest and credible. On \nthis record and with his finances, he has pursued every alternative that appears to be \navailable. I find that AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nThe Appeal Board has held that it is not necessary to pay off all the debts alleged \nin the SOR, nor is it required that they be paid off in any particular way. What is required \nis only that an Applicant have a reasonable plan to pay off his debts, and has taken some \nsteps towards execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 3, 2011). I find that the evidence supports that conclusion here. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for delinquent state taxes of $15,000. Applicant has consulted his tax \nadvisors (CPAs) and a State tax authority. He was advised to rectify his federal tax issues \nbefore addressing his state tax issues. He has simply followed their advice. I find in favor \nof Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for $930. Applicant does not know to whom to return the gear that \nwas issued more than 10 years ago. The credit report sheds little light on that question. \nThe amount owed does not raise national security concerns. And the law does not require \nthe doing of a futile act. See Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980). I find in favor of \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Answer) \nOn September 27, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM) and provided a complete copy to Applicant. Department Counsel\u2019s FORM \nincludes Items 1 through 6. Item 3 is the summary of an interview with an investigator \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted in March 2022. The FORM \nincludes a notice to Applicant informing him of his opportunity to make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates to the interview summary or to object to the admissibility \nof Item 3. The notice further informs Applicant that if he does not raise an objection or \nrespond to the FORM, a DOHA administrative judge may determine that he has waived \nany objections to the admissibility of the summaries. \nOn October 19, 2022, Applicant received the FORM and its attachments. He timely \nsubmitted a response to the FORM, which I labeled as Applicant's Exhibit (AE) A and B. \nAll exhibits submitted by the Government and Applicant were admitted into evidence, \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 61 years old. In 1982, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic \nengineering technology. He also graduated with an associate degree in business \nadministration in 1992, and with two master\u2019s degrees in project management and \nbusiness administration in 2005. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2013. He married \nhis second wife in 2013. He has an adult son and an adult disabled daughter from his first \nmarriage. He has a 13-year-old daughter with his current wife. Since July 2007, he has \nbeen employed as an engineer for a DOD contractor. (Items 2 and 6; AE B) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent accounts totaling $35,818. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted all 11 delinquent accounts and listed that the financial issues were \ndue to circumstances \u201clargely beyond [his] control.\u201d He had court-ordered garnishments \nissued against him due to divorce court orders. His divorce was 20 months long, and he \nhad to pay legal fees, ordered to provide alimony and child support, and he had a \nperpetual wage garnishment issued against him due to his special needs adult daughter. \nSince he remarried, he has been supporting two families. He also pays for private school, \nprivate music lessons, tutoring expenses, orthodontics, and a summer school program \nfor his teenage daughter. His admissions and the credit reports in evidence support the \nSOR financial allegations. (Items 1, 5 and 6, AE A and B) \nDuring his March 31, 2022 security interview, Applicant discussed his delinquent \nfinancial accounts that were listed in the SOR. He explained that his accounts became \ndelinquent because of the divorce and writs of garnishments. He told the investigator that \nif he receives a collection notice from a creditor, he shreds the document without opening \nit. He does not see any value in reviewing the collection notice. He has decided the \ncreditors should choose to either issue him a 1099-C, or obtain a writ of garnishment \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthrough the legal process.

(Item 3)   \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in \nhandling and safeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports and admissions in the record. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose several years ago from his 2013 divorce, \nthey have persisted without any evidence of debt-resolution efforts by him. The August \n2022 credit report in the record shows that his debts have not been reduced. An individual \nentrusted to safeguard sensitive and classified information is expected to act in a \nfinancially responsible manner. During his March 2022 security interview, Applicant \nacknowledged his financial delinquencies and expressed his intent to take no action to \nresolve his delinquent debts. He has not communicated with his creditors or made \npayment arrangements to resolve these delinquent debts. He did not provide any \nevidence of his current financial circumstances with the submission of a monthly budget \nor a personal financial statement. \nAbsent evidence of any debt-resolution efforts or other evidence demonstrating his \nfinancial responsibility, Applicant has not established he possesses the requisite good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness the Government expects when an individual has \nbeen granted access to classified information. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his ongoing financial \ndelinquencies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant experienced financial issues attributed to, what appears to be, a \ncontentious divorce. He has decided to ignore his delinquent creditors and he does not \nintend to take any responsible action to address his delinquent debts. Given the entirety \nof the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. 18-20, 35-37) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to unemployment and to family issues. \nHer mother-in-law had cancer, and she and her husband helped her with medical bills. \nHer mother-in-law did not have insurance. They overextended themselves to help her \nmaintain her obligations because she was unable to work. She passed away in January \n2020. They also had two other family members pass away and they felt an obligation to \nhelp. (Tr. 23-24 \nApplicant testified that she had been making consistent payments on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($25,956) before she closed her daycare business in 2018. After the debt went \nin collection status, she contacted the creditor to make a payment arrangement in about \nJune 2019 after she got a temporary job. She made payments for about six to eight \nmonths but then was unable because of family obligations. She contacted the creditor a \nweek before her hearing and is attempting to find the collection company that owns the \ndebt. She anticipated contacting them and working on a payment arrangement. She has \nreceived settlement offers from other creditors and hopes to make payment arrangements \nbut is unable to at this time because she does not have the money. (Tr. 20-30) \nApplicant current annual salary is approximately $36,000 to $38,000. At her prior \nemployment she earned about $31,000 and was an hourly employee.

They have no savings, but she does have a \n401k retirement account with about $2,000 in it. She enrolled in a debt consolidation \nprogram in about 2022 but decided the fees, in addition to the monthly payments, were \ntoo expensive. She has contemplated filing for bankruptcy but cannot afford the attorney\u2019s \nfees and intends to research if there is a way to do so with reduced legal fees. Applicant \nhas delayed addressing her delinquent bills because she does not want to contact a \ncreditor when she does not have the money to make a settlement offer or payment plan. \n(Tr. 25, 33-47) \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2021 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing, she disclosed she had one debt that became delinquent in 2016 that she was \nunable to pay because she was unemployed. In her response to government \ninterrogatories, she provided proof that she paid a delinquent debt in April 2022. This debt \nwas not alleged in the SOR. She also said that she was paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h \n($733) but she did not provide proof that she made payments or resolved the debt. (Tr. \n30-32; GE 1, 2) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will be not considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, \nin making a credibility determination and in a whole-person analysis. \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $46,746. None have \nbeen paid or resolved. The delinquencies began about 2015, but most of the debts \nbecame delinquent around 2017, 2018 and 2019. In her SOR answer, she denied the \ndebt in \u00b6 1.c. She testified that she is responsible for this debt. She confused it with \nanother account that was paid. Some creditors have offered settlement agreements, but \nshe is unable to accept them at this time. (Tr. 48-60) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \ntestimony, responses to interrogatories, and credit reports from October 2021, May 2022, \nand January 2023. (GE 1-5) \nApplicant has approximately $56,000 in student loans that are in a deferred status \ndue to financial hardship. She has not made payments in five years. She recently received \nnotification that the pandemic deferral was expiring, but her loans will remain deferred \ndue to her financial status. (Tr. 60-61) \nApplicant testified that she intends to pay her delinquent debts and wants to pay \nthem. Her husband testified on her behalf. He affirmed that their finances were impacted \ndue to deaths and illnesses in the family. He has been working extra hours to make more \nmoney and is working parttime as a handyman.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s debts started to be delinquent in about 2016. None of the SOR debts \nare paid or being resolved. Applicant does not have the resources to pay or resolve her \ndebts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to unemployment, underemployment, \nand helping family members in need. These conditions were beyond her control. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. At this point, \nApplicant does not have the resources to pay her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies. There is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling. There are not clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. There is no evidence she has \nmade a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Her debts \nremain unresolved and unpaid. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guidelines F, financial \nconsiderations. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Applicant \nreceived the FORM on October 5, 2022. No subsequent response from Applicant was \nreceived by DOHA, and the case was assigned to me on January 6, 2023. Since \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, he did not submit any evidence after answering \nthe SOR, nor did he offer any objection to Items 3 or 4, which are, therefore, admitted \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, without further comment. \nHis admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.

He did not respond to the FORM, so he \noffered no new information that could mitigate his past conduct or future intentions. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, a \nposition of public trust. As the Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n\u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance and trustworthiness \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 U.S. 518, 531 \n(1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of public trust, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion\u201d to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the trustworthiness concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nIt is illegal under Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, \nincluding marijuana. (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844) \nAll controlled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their accepted \nmedical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on \nthe body. (\u00a7\u00a7811, 812) Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \n\u00a7812(c), based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no \naccepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. (\u00a7812(b)(1); See Gonzales v. \nRaich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005)) \nApplicant disclosed on his August 2021 application that he has used marijuana \non a daily basis for the previous five years. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nApplicant indicated his intention to continue to use marijuana, despite being \naware of the consequences. He also failed \u201cto clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue\u201d his marijuana use, so AG \u00b6 25(g) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26, including the \nfollowing: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national trustworthiness eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is frequent, recent, and likely ongoing, as he stated \nan intention to continue using marijuana because he enjoys it, notwithstanding any \nresulting consequences. Applicant\u2019s pattern and use of marijuana continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to his \neligibility for a position of public trust, or access to sensitive information. He gave no \nindication that he intends to stop using marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant offered no whole-person evidence to consider. He admitted both \nallegations without comment and did not offer any additional evidence. \nThe only \nexhibits are his application and his interview summary. He disclosed his extensive \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nhistory of frequent, often daily use of marijuana and purchase of it, and indicated without \nreservation that he would continue to do so.  \nApplicant seeks eligibility for a position of public trust, granted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense, and marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance \nunder Federal law. He has a recent history and pattern of disregarding Federal law in \nusing and purchasing marijuana. He offered no mitigating evidence to suggest a change \nof heart. \nI conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance misuse. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a trustworthiness clearance. Granting of eligibility for a position of public \ntrust and eligibility for access to sensitive information is not warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a position of public trust.

Occasionally, she used marijuana \nduring the day for pain relief. During that period, she underwent multiple surgeries on her \nleg and foot. When she was prescribed opioids after surgeries, she did not use marijuana \nat the direction of her doctors. Her current doctor is aware that in the past she used \nmarijuana for her pain in addition to the medications he prescribed. (Tr. at 28-40.) \nApplicant last used marijuana in August 2021, just before she was hired for her \ncurrent position in September 2021. She stopped using marijuana at that time because \nshe knew it was not legal federally and she did not want to risk losing her job opportunity \nto work for a federal contractor. (Tr. at 24-27.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant candidly admitted that she purchased and used \nmarijuana once after she was hired by her current employer. She had temporarily run out \nof her prescription medication for her nerve pain and needed help to relieve her pain at \nnight so she could sleep. The lack of medication during that period of about six nights \nalso put her at risk of having seizures. One of the uses of her medication is to prevent \nseizures. By running out of the medication, which she takes in very high doses, she \nincreases her risk of seizures. Marijuana reduced that risk because it calms the nervous \nsystem like her medication. (Tr. at 30-40.) \nApplicant is required to refill her prescriptions for the pain medication every three \nmonths and must see her doctor in person to receive the refill prescription. She has \ndifficulty scheduling an appointment with him because he has a busy practice. On this \none occasion, she made a mistake and called a little too late to receive a timely \nappointment. Once she received the new prescription, it took a few more days for the \npharmacy to mail her the medication. She legally purchased the marijuana under her state \nlaw for the limited purpose of filling in the gap due to her lack of medication. She does not \nanticipate having a problem like this in the future. She felt too much anxiety about risking \nher job by using marijuana during that week to ever permit herself to be in that position \nagain. Her job is too important to her. She is anxious to maintain a happy and healthy \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \ntrajectory in her life after so many years of misery due to her condition.

This daily routine made her more susceptible to even greater pain \nwithout her medication. After eight months, she relocated to a new home near her job to \navoid the excessive wear on her fragile condition. (Tr. at 44.) \nApplicant is comfortable with her prescription medications now. She is reducing \nthe amounts of the medication using alternative strategies to relieve her pain. She lives \nby herself with her dog. She is not surrounded by people who use marijuana as she was \nduring her college and subsequent years. She never finds herself in the company of \nothers using marijuana. (Tr. at 32- 35, 37.) \n1.b. Marijuana Purchases. See discussion under 1.c, below. \n1.c. Mushroom Use and Purchases. Applicant wrote in the Answer that she\npurchased and used mushrooms \u201cinconsistently between [about February 2015 and \nabout December 2019] to help with the tough emotional and spiritual part of chronic pain \nat 21 years old.\u201d Her last use of mushrooms was in or about December 2019. When she \nwas diagnosed with CRPS just before her 22nd  birthday, she was devastated and at a \nloss receiving such bad news about her health at her young age. At times, she wanted to \nend her life because her pain was unbearable. She used mushrooms when she was \ndesperate, such as after a failed surgery for her condition. She used mushrooms about \nfive times over nine years. She has no intention to use or purchase mushrooms in the \nfuture, noting in the Answer that she was \u201cdoing much better, thankfully.\u201d Applicant is very \nhappy with her life now and the direction it is going. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 27, 35-36.) \n \n1.d. Intent to Use Cannabis in the Future. In the Answer, Applicant wrote that, \u201cI \nadmit medical cannabis helps my pain and the struggles my pain puts me through, but if \nit means putting my job at risk then I wont use cannabis unless it becomes federally legal.\u201d \nShe credibly testified that she has no future intent to use cannabis. She explained her \nposition further and clarified her statement in her security interview on the subject of her \nfuture intent to use cannabis. She said that in the event that cannabis became legal at \nthe federal level in the future, she would use cannabis again for her medical condition. If \nthere is no change in federal law, then she has no intention to use marijuana in the future. \n(Answer at 2; Tr. at 23-24, 44.) \n1.e. Intent to Use Mushrooms in the Future. At the time of her security interview, \nApplicant candidly commented that she may use cannabis and mushrooms occasionally \nwhen necessary due to pain or for celebratory purposes. She denied in the Answer any \nfuture intent to use mushrooms. She credibly testified that she now has no future intent \nto use mushrooms.

She has an emotional support dog. She rescues injured and \nlost pets and finds them good homes. She is the best condition she has been in for nearly \na decade. She is determined to do what she needs to do to maintain this trajectory and \nhas been extremely honest about her past. She has received a coin of appreciation for \nher excellent work. She describes her job as the culmination of nearly 10 years of hard, \nvery painful work. She is dedicated to maintaining her improved health and her journey \nto an even higher level of recovery. (Tr. at 49-50.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, and her detailed testimony regarding her \nhistory of drug use, establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (b). She also used marijuana for about a \nweek after submitting her e-QIP.

Overall, the \nrecord evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nher conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued the Guidance to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed the previous SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding \nthe importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant has fully established mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1) and (b)(2). \nHer illegal drug use since her accident in 2014 occurred under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Her painful chronic condition had caused her to seek any relief \npossible, and for her the relief came in a combination of prescription medication for her \nseverely damaged nerves and marijuana to help her sleep at night. Since the prospect of \ngaining full-time employment in her field with a federal contractor in 2021, she established \nan extended pattern of abstinence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe one exception to her abstinence was due the unusual circumstances created \nby a timing issue that delayed the delivery of a refill of her most important prescription \nmedication. Applicant has credibly testified that those circumstances will not be repeated \nin the future and that even if she does experience a timing gap in the delivery of her \nmedication, she is equipped today to handle such an emergency without resorting to \nmarijuana. The key difference between then and now is that she no longer spends four \nhours a day in her car commuting to and from her workplace. Without that strain on her \ndisabled body, she is confident that she can treat herself using lawful alternative \nmedications in the event she finds herself without her prescription medications. \nMoreover, Applicant experienced serious anxiety when she broke her abstinence \nfor six nights. Her job and the recovery her employment represent to her is too important \nto her to ever put herself at risk of losing her job in the future. She is committed to never \nrepeating that experience with marijuana. Also, she is committed to never allowing herself \nto run out of medication. Under all of the circumstances presented in this case, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has an even longer period of abstinence in the use of mushrooms. She \nused mushrooms a limited number of times in the past when she felt despair over her \ncondition and her future of living with severe chronic pain. She found that mushrooms \ngave her the perspective and the courage to continue with her struggle. Now that her life \nhas never been better with her job and her independent lifestyle, she has no use for \nmushrooms and will never risk her employment by using them. She has no intention of \never using mushrooms again. \nIn addition, AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(2) are applicable. Applicant no longer \nassociates with drug-using friends or contacts and has relocated to a residence where \nshe lives alone and has complete control over the persons with whom she associates. \nNone of her current associates use illegal drugs. \nOverall, Applicant has worked hard to mitigate the security concerns raised by her \npast use of marijuana to relieve her chronic pain and mushrooms to manage her rare \nmoments of extreme crisis. She has carried her burden of persuasion and mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the above whole-person factors and the potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, as well as the SecEA\u2019s Guidance, in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has fully mitigated her past drug use. Her \nrecent forthright disclosures of her history of drug use have minimized or eliminated the \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress. It is unlikely that she will have any recurrence \nof similar drug use in the future. Overall, the record evidence does not raise any questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since December 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1978 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2000. He attended college for a period without earning a degree. He married for the third time in 2015 after his first two marriages ended in divorce. He has an adult child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19-21; GE 1, 2) Applicant has a history of tax problems, including not filing his federal income tax returns for 2014 through 2020 when they were due. He stated, without documentation, that he thought the 2014 tax return had been filed. He has spent much of his time since 2010 working overseas for defense contractors. His tax issues started in about 2013 when he was evacuated to the United States for medical issues. He returned overseas about eight months later, but after a few months, he had to be evacuated again to the United States. He felt that he would catch up on the returns at a later date. (Tr. at 16, 26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) Applicant\u2019s wife retained a tax company (Tax Company 1) in 2018 to file their back returns.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since December 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. \nmilitary from 1978 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2000. He attended \ncollege for a period without earning a degree. He married for the third time in 2015 after \nhis first two marriages ended in divorce. He has an adult child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19-21; \nGE 1, 2) \nApplicant has a history of tax problems, including not filing his federal income tax \nreturns for 2014 through 2020 when they were due. He stated, without documentation, \nthat he thought the 2014 tax return had been filed. He has spent much of his time since \n2010 working overseas for defense contractors. His tax issues started in about 2013 \nwhen he was evacuated to the United States for medical issues. He returned overseas \nabout eight months later, but after a few months, he had to be evacuated again to the \nUnited States. He felt that he would catch up on the returns at a later date. (Tr. at 16, \n26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant\u2019s wife retained a tax company (Tax Company 1) in 2018 to file their \nback returns. The owners of the company were convicted of defrauding the IRS out of \n$3.3 million in 2021, by knowingly and fraudulently preparing and filing fraudulent client \ntax returns. Applicant stated that he was unaware that the company never filed his \nreturns. (Tr. at 16, 30, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE 1, 4) \nApplicant retained another tax company (Tax Company 2) in September 2020 to \nfile his back returns and negotiate any taxes owed. He reported tax issues on a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted on October 22, \n2020. He wrote that he had hired a tax agency (Tax Company 2) to file the returns and \nassist him in settling any taxes owed. He estimated that he owed $26,400 for tax years \n2024 to 2019.1 He wrote: \u201cfederal tax documents have been returned/completed by tax \npreparer and awaiting submission. Enrolled in tax forgiveness program.\u201d (Tr. at 16-17; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE 1, 4) \nThe back returns were not filed, and Applicant was not enrolled in a tax \nforgiveness program. He retained a third tax company (Tax Company 3) on December \n1, 2020, to file his back returns and negotiate any taxes owed. He was interviewed for \nhis background investigation on December 2, 2020. He stated that he had previously \nhired a tax agency (Tax Company 2) to assist him with his taxes, but he was unhappy \nwith their services and decided to move on to the company he had just hired. He stated \nthat he was in a tax forgiveness program. He hoped to have all his tax issues resolved \nby the end of 2021. (Tr. at 30-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE 1, 4) \n1 Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR, such as unpaid taxes, cannot be used for disqualification \npurposes.

He estimates that he owes the IRS about \n$25,000. He asserted that he fully intends to file the back returns and pay whatever \ntaxes are owed.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2014 through 2020 federal income tax returns when they \nwere due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues started in about 2013 when he was working overseas, and \nhe was evacuated to the United States for medical issues. He returned overseas about \neight months later, but after a few months, he had to be evacuated again to the United \nStates. He felt that he would catch up on the returns at a later date. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax problems, and he stated that he was \nnot attempting to circumvent the tax laws. He has gone through four tax companies, but \nhis returns have still not been filed, and he estimates that he owes the IRS about \n$25,000. He asserted that he fully intends to file the back returns and pay whatever \ntaxes are owed. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. His \nfailure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes continues to raise \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 5, 8) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $40,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). These delinquencies consist of credit \ncards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.h). He admitted the SOR \nallegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are \nestablished through his admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. The SOR \ndebts became delinquent between June 2018 and July 2020. He failed to provide any \nevidence that he contacted the lenders, set up any payment plans for his SOR debts, or \npaid any of the accounts. He does not answer phone calls from unknown numbers and \ndoes not open mail that he believes has been auto generated, so he does not know if \nhis creditors have attempted to contact him. The SOR debts remain unresolved. (Items \n2-4, 6-8) \nApplicant became delinquent on the SOR debts because he used credit to pay \nfor disaster prepping and made no effort to pay the money back. He also acknowledged \nthat he overspent on alcohol at bars. He admitted that he was irresponsible with his \nfinances. Despite having made no effort to repay the creditors listed in the SOR, he \nclaimed that he is now more responsible with his finances. He claimed that he no longer \nuses credit. He estimated that he has about $300 in surplus funds at the end of each \nmonth, however, he reported having no money in his savings account. He claimed that \nin 2019, he resolved a credit card that was not listed in the SOR. The available \nevidence does not corroborate this resolution. He provided no evidence that he has \nundergone financial counseling. He did not respond to the FORM, so more recent \ninformation about his finances is not available. (Items 3, 7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a number of delinquent debts, many of which are several years \nold. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. He has not \nprovided evidence that he has resolved or is resolving his SOR debts. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by financial irresponsibility and \noverspending. These causes were not beyond his control. Even if they were, because \nhe has not attempted to resolve his debts, he has not shown that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances with respect to these debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. The \nlack of resolution of his SOR debts also means that AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. He \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence that any of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

A May 2022 credit report lists the account as $11,086 past due, with a \nbalance of $288,546 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant withdrew from his 401(k) retirement \naccount to bring the loan current. (Tr. at 17-18, 21, 43-47; GE 2, 3, 6; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s wife was in a car accident in about 2016. Her car was a total loss, \nand she had a neck injury that required an operation. There was a delay in receiving \nfunds from the insurance company. Rather than wait for the insurance company, \nApplicant and his wife took out a loan of between about $23,000 and $30,000 in \nOctober 2016, which was used to buy a car and pay her medical bills. When a \nsettlement was received, his wife took the money and did not give him anything to pay \nthe loan. He made his last payment on the account in February 2019, and the creditor \ncharged off the account with a balance of $23,829 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He made no attempt to \nresolve the account after it was charged off, until the SOR spurred him into taking some \naction. (Tr. at 25-32, 42; GE 2, 3, 6) \nApplicant and his wife entered into a mediated settlement agreement in May \n2023. The agreement provided that their house would be sold at a mutually agreed \nupon price. The SOR \u00b6 1.a debt would be \u201cnegotiated down as low as possible and paid \nin full\u201d from the proceeds of the sale. They also agreed to pay the IRS $7,500 for their \n2022 taxes from the proceeds. Applicant and the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor agreed to settle the \ndebt for a lump-sum payment of $7,148, to be paid no later than June 11, 2023. (Tr. at \n35, 39-40, 48; AE B, C) \nApplicant testified that there was interest in the house, \u201cthe housing market is \nvery high over here right now,\u201d and he expected the house to be sold. He stated that if \nthe house is not sold, he would start paying $297 per month to the creditor until the \nhouse is sold. The creditor told him that the settlement deal would still be available if he \nmade those payments. He stated that his finances will be stable after the house is sold. \nIn June 2023, he stated that he made a $200 payment to the creditor to keep the \nsettlement deal, but he did not submit any supporting documentation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant defaulted on a mortgage loan and a consumer loan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his separation, pending divorce, \nand his wife\u2019s overspending. Those events were beyond his control. To receive the \nbenefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also prove that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant withdrew from his 401(k) and brought his mortgage loan current. SOR \n\u00b6 1.b is mitigated. He made no attempts to resolve the consumer loan on SOR \u00b6 1.a \nafter it was charged off, until the SOR spurred him into taking some action. An applicant \nwho begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his \nor her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules \nand regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. ISCR Case No. \n17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nApplicant and his wife entered into a mediated settlement agreement in May \n2023. The agreement provided that the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt would be \u201cnegotiated down as \nlow as possible and paid in full\u201d from the proceeds of the sale of their house. Applicant \nand the creditor agreed to settle the debt for a lump-sum payment of $7,148, to be paid \nno later than June 11, 2023. He testified that if the house is not sold, he would start \npaying $297 per month to the creditor until the house is sold. The creditor told him that \nthe settlement deal would still be available if he made those payments. The house \nnever sold, Applicant has never settled the debt, and he has not provided \ndocumentation of any payments. His intention to pay the debt in the future is not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay the remaining SOR debt. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay \nthe debt. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable. None of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He reported unemployment from October 2019 through December 2019. \nHe worked for another employer from December 2019 until he started at his current \nposition in July 2020. (Item 4) \nThe amended SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $23,480. \nApplicant owed all of the debts at one time, as established through his admissions and \ncredit reports. (Items 3-8; AE A) \nApplicant retained a law firm to assist him in managing his and his wife\u2019s debts. \nHe entered into payment agreements to pay the $3,666 and $366 debts owed to the \nsame collection company for the same bank. The original amount owed on the $3,066 \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) is unclear, but the March 2021 credit report listed the balance as \n$4,837.

He stated that he asked the credit union that \nfinanced the loan to give him a few months until he found another job, but the credit \nunion was unwilling to work with him and repossessed the vehicle. The credit union \ncharged off $13,342 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), which was apparently the deficiency balance owed on \nthe loan after the vehicle was sold. He told a background investigator in April 2022 that \nhe missed about four payments before the vehicle was repossessed. He does not feel \nthat he should have to pay for a vehicle that he does not own. He stated that he will \ncontinue to dispute the account. (Items 3, 5-8; AE A) \nApplicant helps his daughter who lives in another state and has been unable to \nwork because of health reasons. He and his wife took in his wife\u2019s niece who was \nsexually abused by her father before he kicked her out of the house. Her father is in jail. \nApplicant stated that his family would be under tremendous stress if he lost his job. (AE \nA) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nindicates that it was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but he has decided that he \nwill not pay the charged-off auto loan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to when he lost his job in 2018, and \nhis wife was only working part-time. He was fired because he failed to report that a \ncompany vehicle had been in an accident. That event was not beyond his control. It is \nalso unclear how long he was unemployed. The additional financial strain brought on by \nfinancially supporting his adult daughter and taking in his wife\u2019s niece were beyond his \ncontrol. I note that some financial problems predated the job loss. To Applicant\u2019s credit, \nhe resolved them in February 2017 when he refinanced his mortgage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant retained a law firm to assist him in managing his and his wife\u2019s debts. \nHe entered into payment agreements to pay the $3,666 and $366 debts before the SOR \nwas issued. The amount owed on those debts was more than reported on the SOR \nbecause he had already started paying them. The $366 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), originally at \nleast $1,192, has been paid. The $3,066 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), originally at least $4,837, is \nbeing paid through $177 monthly payments. The balance in October 2022 was $1,472. \nThe $105 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was paid in November 2022. Those three debts are \nmitigated. \nApplicant stated that he will address the $6,663 credit union debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nafter he finishes paying the smaller debt. There is no indication that he has any intention \nto pay the charged-off $13,342 auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He stated that he asked the \ncredit union to give him a few months until he found another job, but the credit union \nwas unwilling to work with him and repossessed the vehicle. However, he told the \nbackground investigator that he missed about four payments before the vehicle was \nrepossessed. That was at least a few months, and based upon the SF 86, it was longer \nthan he was unemployed. \nThis is a close case, but AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s \nremaining financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to \nfind that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith \neffort to pay the remaining debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to eliminate \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 1, 3 and 4) \nApplicant disclosed on the February 2022 SCA that he had used marijuana \nbetween April 1992 and January 2022, \u201cuse as needed for [back] pain.\u201d When responding \nto the SCA\u2019s inquiry as to his intentions for future use of an illegal drug, he listed that he \nintended to use marijuana, as needed for his back pain, and while \u201cnot working.\u201d (Item 4) \nApplicant was interviewed on April 5, 2022 by an authorized DOD investigator. \nApplicant admitted that he had used psilocybin mushrooms and LSD on two occasions \nbetween September 1990 and September 2015, which is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant also admitted he used marijuana at home. He obtained the marijuana from his \nfriend. He last used marijuana in January 2022, and his motivation for using marijuana \nwas to relieve his back pain. He acknowledged he did not have a medical prescription to \nuse marijuana. He has never had any involvement with law enforcement for his illegal \ndrug use, and he has never received treatment, or been diagnosed with a substance use \ndisorder. He told the investigator that he is \u201cunlikely\u201d to use marijuana again since he is \nno longer motivated or interested in using it.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant\u2019s admission and evidence in the FORM establish he used and \npossessed marijuana from about April 1992 to January 2022, as alleged. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for approximately 30 years and to at least January 2022, \nwhen he was 46 years old. Although he was candid about his intended future use of \nmarijuana when asked on the SCA, I find his change of heart that he was \u201cunlikely\u201d to use \nmarijuana again during his background interview two months later to be far-fetched and \nself-serving. For Applicant to claim that he is no longer interested or motivated to use \nmarijuana is not convincing. Additionally, he has provided no evidence corroborating his \nclaims of abstinence, disassociation from persons who use drugs, or avoidance of \nenvironments where drugs are used. Because he requested a determination on the \nrecord without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred for a long period of time and a month \nbefore he completed his SCA. He was not a young, naive adult when he used marijuana. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis drug involvement. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for granting of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With a longer period of abstinence from substance misuse, he may be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

I received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on November 21, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has \nworked since August 2019. He earned a high school diploma in 2012. He is currently \ntaking undergraduate courses. He will earn an associate degree in December 2023 and \nis on track to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2024. He was married from 2014 until a \ndivorce in 2018. He has resided with a cohabitant since October 2019. He has three \nchildren, ages nine, six, and three. His two older children are from his marriage. He and \nhis cohabitant are the parents of his youngest child. He enlisted in the Army in 2013 and \nwas honorably discharged in 2017. He has held a security clearance since 2013. (Tr. \n18-21, 27-28, 35, 38-43; GE 1) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s seven delinquent financial \naccounts totaling approximately $32,000. It also alleged that he had a delinquent \nmortgage account that was foreclosed in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). These delinquent accounts \nconsist of a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.a), an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a medical debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), telecommunications debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g), and a cleaning fee from a \nresidential lease (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and \n1.d, but denied the rest because he claimed he had resolved those accounts. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. All the SOR allegations are established by \nhis admissions and the Government\u2019s 2021, 2022, and 2023 credit reports. (Answer; \nGE 2-5) \nExcept for the foreclosed mortgage in SOR \u00b6 1.d, between 2022 and the \nbeginning of 2023, Applicant resolved all the accounts in the SOR. He fell behind on all \nthe SOR accounts in about 2018 because of his divorce, underemployment, and \nunemployment. He also had health issues that contributed to his financial issues and \nwas recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). In about 2022, after moving to a \nlocation with a lower cost of living, finding gainful employment, having his military \ndisability payment markedly increase, and after his divorce and child custody issues \nwere largely behind him, he contacted creditors for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c \nand 1.e through 1.g. He made payment arrangements with the creditors and satisfied \nthese debts. For the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, he paid approximately the full \nbalance. For the other SOR debts, he settled them for a reduced amount. I observed his \ndemeanor while he testified and found his testimony, including his statements about the \nresolution of his SOR debts, to be credible. He also provided documentary \ncorroboration of the resolution of some of these debts. (Tr. 18-21, 28-34, 40-45, 50-67; \nAnswer; GE 2-5) \nWith respect to his mortgage foreclosure in SOR \u00b6 1.d, when Applicant realized \nhe could not afford to make his monthly payments because of his divorce, he hired a \ncompany to advocate on his behalf with the mortgage company.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s seven delinquent consumer accounts totaling approximately $32,000 \nwere delinquent for several years. In 2019, he also had a foreclosed mortgage account. \nThe above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s \ndelinquencies \nwere \ncaused \nby \ndivorce, \nunderemployment, \nunemployment, and health issues. These conditions were largely beyond his control. In \nresponse, he acted responsibly by contacting creditors, making payment arrangements, \nand complying with those arrangements. He also tried to work with the mortgage holder \nof his marital home before ultimately allowing the account to go to foreclosure, where \nthe sale of the marital home resolved the mortgage. He started making some of these \npayment arrangements prior to receiving the SOR. He contacted creditors after he had \nenough money to pay the SOR debts. He has provided sufficient evidence that his \nefforts to repay overdue creditors were made in good faith. Given his current financial \nsituation, including his income and savings, as well as the fact that he has no delinquent \ndebts, I find that his financial issues are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. All the above mitigating \nconditions apply. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 12, 2021. On October \n3, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 15, 2022, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He attached his earning\u2019s \nstatement from December 2022 to his SOR response. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on February 6, 2023, including Items 1 through 7. On the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsame date, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, \nwho was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on February 9, 2023, and \ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2023. Items 1 through 7 are \nadmitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old machine operator employed by defense contractors \nsince February 2019. In 2022, Applicant\u2019s gross annual earnings exceeded $88,000, \ninclusive of company incentive pay totaling $14,000. Applicant is a participant in the \ncompany\u2019s 401(k) plan, having contributed over $6,000 pre-tax to the plan in 2022. (Item \n2 at 4). Prior to this position, Applicant worked as a construction laborer from March 2018 \nthrough February 2019; a self-employed Uber driver from June 2015 through March 2018; \nand a process engineer from June 2007 through June 2015. He states he left the position \nin June 2015 because the company moved its operations out-of-state. (Item 3 pp. 15 \nthrough 16) All told, Applicant has been consistently employed without any meaningful \ngap in employment since at least mid-2007. (Items 2 through 4) \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s education. (Items 3 \nthrough 4) He married the first time in 1996, but the marriage did not last and the couple \nparted ways in 1996. He married a second time in January 2009. The couple have two \nchildren, ages 13 and 10 years. He states his wife never worked outside of the family \nhome. (Items 3 through 4) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.d and 1.e are duplicate accounts. The eight non-duplicate debts total about $30,306 \nand are reflected in credit bureau reports from July 2021 (Item 5) and April 2022 (Item 6). \nThese debts are established through these credit bureau reports; Applicant\u2019s admissions \nin his Response to the SOR; and his September 2021 investigative interview. (Items 2, \nand 4 through 6)\n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to medical debts incurred after the birth \nof his daughter in 2012. (Item 4 at 6) He stated other debts went unpaid due to him having \nto pay medical bills to the hospital that provided delivery services to his wife for the birth \nof his daughter. He states he did not have enough income to simultaneously support his \nfamily and pay his debts; and that he was the sole income-earner in the family, and his \nincome remained stagnant as the cost of living and other expenses increased over time. \nFinally, he states he used credit cards to pay bills during the period. (Items 2 and 4) He \nprovided no evidence or any details concerning his income or his general financial \nobligations during this period or afterwards, except his December 2022 earnings \nstatement attached to the Response to the SOR.

Both accounts were \nassigned to collection; SOR \u00b6 1.a. was assigned in April 2014; and SOR \u00b6 1.b was \nassigned in April 2015. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 2) The creditor charged off both accounts \nin about January 2018. A third delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $4,154 was \nassigned for collection in June 2015; it was charged off in about June 2021. (Item 5 at 3 \nand Item 6 at 2) Five remaining delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.f through \n1.i, were assigned to collection between July 2017 and July 2020. All five debts remain in \na collection status. (Items 5 and 6) \nAfter admitting responsibility for all delinquent debts in the SOR, Applicant loosely \nmade the following additional comment concerning the debts: \u201c[T]hey are deducting my \nwages from my paycheck already.\u201d (Item 2 at 2) He told investigators in September 2021, \nthat he would take the following actions concerning these debts to resolve them within \nthe next two years: (i) contact creditors to negotiate a monthly payment plan; or (ii) settle \nwith creditors to pay off debts; or (iii) contract with a third-party debt repayment company \nto consolidate all delinquent debts to pay off debts over time through monthly installments. \n(Item 4 pp. 7 through 8) There is no evidence in the record he took any of the \naforementioned actions. In the same interview, he commented that his current income is \nbetter and more stable, enabling him to financially support his family; he lives within his \nmeans; and does not foresee having delinquent debts in the future. (Item 4 at 8) \nApplicant\u2019s December 2022 earnings statement reflects an unidentified creditor\ngarnished his pay in the amount of $564.52 for an unidentified delinquent debt. The year-\nto-date garnishment totaled $1,776.31 during this period. His earnings statement also \nshows five loans collateralized against his 401(k) funds of an unknown total balance. \n(Item 2 at 4) No information was provided concerning the purpose of the five loans. Other \nthan the earnings statement discussed above, he provided no documentary proof of \nefforts or decisions taken to resolve delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 2 at 4) \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts in this \nSOR that remain outstanding. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant attributed his financial problems to \nmedical debts incurred related to the birth of his daughter in 2012, stating he was unable \nto pay other debts due to having to pay medical expenses; and, as the sole income-earner \nin the family, he was not earning enough to pay his bills on time and still support his family. \nIn 2012, Applicant had been working as a process engineer with the same employer since \n2007. He presented no information concerning his income at the time; nor did he present \ninformation concerning medical or hospital bills, or any other bills he was responsible for \npaying. He has not submitted evidence that he acted responsibly in the 10 years since \nhis daughter\u2019s birth. Moreover, there is no evidence he took the actions he informed \ninvestigators he would take in his September 2021 interview. There is no evidence he: (i) \ncontacted any creditors to negotiate a monthly payment plan; or (ii) settled any debts with \ncreditors; or (iii) that he contracted with a debt-settlement company. At least one creditor \nprevailed in garnishing his wages due to his non-payment of one or more delinquent \ndebts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant submitted no documentary \nevidence of financial counseling, contacts with creditors, payments, payment plans, or \nother evidence of efforts to resolve his debts. He presented his December 2022 earnings \nstatement that showed an unidentified creditor garnished his wages for an unidentified \ndelinquent debt. A court-mandated or an otherwise involuntary means of debt resolution \nsuch as garnishment is entitled to less weight than efforts initiated and carried out by a \ndebtor; that is, reliance upon garnishment does not equate to good-faith efforts by \nApplicant to resolve his financial problems. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jul. 7, 2016). Applicant gets minimal credit for debts addressed by a creditor\u2019s \ngarnishment action. However, there is inadequate information regarding the garnishment \ncreditor and the relevant debt to award any credit here. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain despite the \npresence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She was \nconfronted by the investigator with her August 2021 termination and she explained that \nshe did not report this information when interviewed in September 2021 because she was \nembarrassed. She previously said she left Company B on good terms. She was \nconfronted by the investigator with the various infractions, and she admitted most of them \nat that time.

(Tr. 30, 37, 39-40, 64-72; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that during this time, she was going through relationship \nproblems that began in 2018, and she was struggling emotionally. She was working \nremotely due to the pandemic, and she was having difficulty adjusting. She admitted she \ndid not handle herself very well, and it impacted her work. She testified that she was \naware of her duty to disclose that she was terminated from employment with Company B \nwhen she was asked about it. She deliberately falsified material facts during her \ninterviews with a government investigator. (Tr. 30, 37, 39, 64-72; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that her personal issues with her partner impacted her life and \nher work. At the time, she was trying to save her relationship and put her life back \ntogether. She quit one job and was not performing well at another. When she quit her job, \nher only income was unemployment benefits, which were insufficient for her to pay her \nbills. She testified that her debts became delinquent in approximately November 2019, \nwhen she stopped making payments. She and her partner separated around 2019. She \ndid not reach out to any of her creditors when she stopped paying her accounts in 2019. \n(Tr. 30-31, 37, 42-43) \nApplicant testified that she pays her ex-partner\u2019s monthly car payment of \napproximately $416 and many of her living expenses. Her ex-partner worked sporadically \nand occasionally contributed to the household expenses throughout their relationship \nwhich began about 2004, but Applicant was primarily responsible for the household \nexpenses. Applicant purchased a house in 2005 and was solely responsible for paying \nthe mortgage. In August 2021, she sold the house so she could give her ex-partner the \nprofit of approximately $42,000. When questioned why she gave the entire profit to her \nex-partner when she had delinquent debts, she said it was because she had made a \nverbal agreement with her to give her the money because she had been unfaithful to her. \n(Tr. 37, 49-54, 75-85) \nDuring the pandemic, Applicant\u2019s partner drove her car to a distant state. Applicant \nwent to pick her up and they left the vehicle there. They decided not to retrieve it for about \n11 months because at the time there were certain border restrictions due to the pandemic. \nApplicant rented a car for her ex-partner from about February 2020 until December 2020 \nwhen they retrieved the other vehicle. She estimated the monthly cost of the vehicle was \napproximately $600-$700. This impacted her ability to pay her other debts.

(Tr. 37. 44-49) \nApplicant lives in a hotel with her dog. Her ex-partner also lives in the same hotel. \nApplicant pays for both hotel rooms, and they have lived there for about two years. She \ntestified that she pays about $3,200 a month for the two rooms. When asked why she did \nnot rent an apartment, she explained it was unaffordable with the extra deposits and \nstartup costs of getting an apartment. She stated that despite the fact she and her ex-\npartner have been separated for an extended period, she continues to financially support \nher. She said her ex-partner has some medical issues. She is not on disability. Her ex-\npartner shares the expenses for the dog. (Tr. 37, 49-57) \nApplicant testified that she has no savings or money in her accounts. After paying \nall her living expenses and some of her ex-partners, she has about $100 left. She does \nnot have investments. She said she withdrew the money she had in an individual \nretirement account years ago. She has not participated in financial counseling in the past \nten years but had some before then.

(Tr. 60-70, 74; AE F, G, I, J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersona, professional, or community standing . . .. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was terminated from her employment in \nAugust 2021 due to breach of contract and violations and infractions of various company \npolicies. She admitted some of the infractions and disputed others. She admitted she \nreceived verbal reprimands from her supervisor. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts during her \ninterview with a government investigator in September 2021 by stating she left her \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployment with Company B in August 2021 for a better opportunity, on good terms, and \nwithout any issues. This was not true as she had been terminated as explained in the \nabove paragraph. She was deliberately untruthful. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant falsified material facts during her interview \nwith a government investigator in January 2022 by confirming that in the last seven years \nshe had not been fired from a job, quit after being told she would be fired, left by mutual \nagreement following allegations of misconduct or notice of unsatisfactory performance, \nreceived a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace. She had in fact been terminated from her employment with \nCompany B as explained in the above paragraph. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not disclose her termination from Company B during her September \n2021 interview. Later in January 2022, she was interviewed a second time and was asked \nif in the last seven years if she had been terminated from a job, and she denied she had \nbeen. After she was confronted with the information by the investigator, she disclosed the \ntermination and circumstances. She said she was embarrassed. Her deliberate \nfalsifications are not minor, and cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s infractions and violations of company policy culminated in her \ntermination, they were mostly minor. I considered that she was going through personal \nproblems at the time and was having difficulty adjusting to working remotely due to the \npandemic. I find AG \u00b6 17(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debts when she quit her job in 2019. She \ndid not have another job lined up when she quit and was unable to pay her debts. \nApplicant made choices about her finances. She chose to give the profits of the sale of \nher house to her ex-partner and live in a hotel for two years, and not address any of her \ndelinquent debts until after receiving the SOR. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of her quitting her job in 2019 and \nthen being unemployed and unable to pay her bills. Her financial problems were \nexacerbated by the choices she made in how she spent her money. She sold her house \nand had a $42,000 profit that she gave to her ex-partner. She chooses to live in a hotel \nbecause she said she cannot afford the deposits for a rental unit. Although she and her \nex-partner are no longer together, Applicant pays most of her expenses. These are not \nconditions that are beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. She has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has resolved or is resolving the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts. She did not begin to address these debts until after \nshe received the SOR. Waiting until a security clearance is in jeopardy before resolving \ndebts may show an applicant may be lacking in judgment expected of those having \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nShe has not addressed her other delinquent debts because she is paying a tax liability \nand does not currently have the resources. She has not had financial counseling in over \nten years. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application as there are \nnot clear indications that her financial problems are under control. Despite some \nmitigation, it is insufficient to mitigate the financial conditions security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGuideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe government must be confident that those holding security clearances comply \nwith rules and regulations, even when they are inconvenient, tedious, or when no one is \nwatching. Being able to rely on those with security clearances to use good judgment and \nbe honest is the cornerstone of the process. Applicant also has an unreliable financial \ntrack record. She has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 2.b-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has an employment offer from a U.S. defense contractor that is conditioned upon his being granted security clearance eligibility. He anticipates that if he begins working for this contractor, he will be living and working in Iraq. He was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Iraqi university. Applicant first came to the U.S in 2013 as a refugee. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2018. He holds both U.S. and Iraqi citizenships. He has never married and has no children.

He has an employment offer \nfrom a U.S. defense contractor that is conditioned upon his being granted security \nclearance eligibility. He anticipates that if he begins working for this contractor, he will \nbe living and working in Iraq. He was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree from an Iraqi university. Applicant first came to the U.S in 2013 as a refugee. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2018. He holds both U.S. and Iraqi \ncitizenships. He has never married and has no children. (Tr. 24-25, 28-30, 34; GE 1-3) \nApplicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), sister (SOR \u00b6 1.b), brother (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and \nseveral friends are citizens and residents of Iraq. His brother and one of these friends \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) are teachers employed by the Iraqi Ministry of Education. Applicant\u2019s father \nwas a lieutenant general in the Iraqi military. He was killed in combat in 1984. \nApplicant\u2019s mother owns real property in Iraq that she uses as rental property. This \nproperty is valued at about $100,000. His mother, brother, and brother\u2019s family live in a \nhome on real property in Iraq that is still titled in his father\u2019s name. This property is \nvalued at about $600,000. Applicant shares an inheritance right among his other \nsiblings in the parcel of land valued at $600,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He also holds a similar \ninheritance right in the parcel of land owned by his mother. In about May 2022, he told \nan Army investigator that he did not want to renounce his Iraqi citizenship because he \nwanted to protect his potential ownership rights in the real property in Iraq titled in his \nfather\u2019s name (SOR \u00b6 2.a). However, he testified at hearing if he was forced to \nrenounce one of his citizenships, he would renounce his Iraqi citizenship. (Tr. 24-25, 38-\n48, 50-61, 63-71; Answer; GE 1-3) \nFor years, Applicant\u2019s mother received a pension from the Iraqi government on \nbehalf of his father after he passed away. She now receives the equivalent of social \nsecurity income from the Iraqi government. Applicant provided his mother and sister \nabout $300 to $400 in support a few times per year until about 2019. He testified that he \nno longer sends money to his mother and sister because he cannot afford to do so. He \nmaintains contact with his mother nearly every day via video chat. He last saw her in \nperson in Iraq in February 2022. (Tr. 43-48, 50-52; Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has contact with his sister four-to-five times per week via video chat. \nShe is a homemaker and has never worked outside the home. She is married to an Iraqi \ncitizen and has five children who are also citizens of Iraq. He last saw her in person in \nIraq in February 2022. (Tr. 52-55; Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has contact with his brother two-to-three times per week via e-mail and \nelectronic chat rooms. His brother is a teacher and is married to an Iraqi citizen. He has \nchildren who are Iraqi citizens. Applicant last saw his brother in person in Iraq in \nFebruary 2022.

Prior to his arrival in the U.S., Applicant worked for a non-governmental \norganization (NGO) in Iraq. Since arriving in the U.S. in 2013, he has worked in the U.S \nas a delivery driver, a driver for a U.S. based corporation providing ride-hailing services, \nand as a technician for a contractor of an internet company. He currently earns about \n$4,000 per month. He has about $4,000 in a U.S. based bank account and about \n$2,000 invested in U.S. based stocks. He owns a car in the U.S. (Tr. 30-38, 47-48, 52-\n64; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant has friends who reside in the U.S., but none of his family members \nreside here. None of his family members hold U.S. citizenship or U.S. residency rights, \nand none of them have visited the U.S. Applicant owns no real property in the U.S.  He \nclaimed his family does not know that he is trying to obtain security clearance eligibility, \nor that he may be working in Iraq. He claimed he will not tell them if he does obtain \nsecurity clearance eligibility. He expressed his loyalty to the United States. He testified \nthat his family in Afghanistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. 30-\n38, 47-48, 52-64; GE 1-3) \nSince he arrived in the U.S. in 2013, Applicant visited Iraq in 2017 and 2021 to \n2022. He stayed in Iraq for about three months in 2017 and for about 14 months in \n2021. He stayed in the house titled in his father\u2019s name with his mother and brother \nwhen he visited. He had in-person contact with his family members and friends during \nthese visits. (Tr. 50-61; GE 1-3) \nIn HE 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of March 2023, about the United States' relations with Iraq and the current conditions \nin that country. I take administrative notice of the information included in those \ndocuments including, but not limited to: \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: \nDo not travel\u201d location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and \nlimited ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and \nWestern companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \noccur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and \nstrikes occur frequently. These events can develop quickly without prior notification, \noften interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the \npotential to turn violent. \nThe country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and several Shia-\nmajority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through 2022, with reports of more \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. Another, similar incident in August \n2022 resulted in more than 20 deaths. The government took minimal steps to bring to \njustice those responsible for the violence. \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking \nU.S. citizens abroad. Primary terrorist threats within Iraq included Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups. ISIS is a designated terrorist \norganization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border.  ISIS and its associated \nterrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite \nimproved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. \ncitizens for attacks and hostage-taking. \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible \nreports of unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances \nby the government; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the \ngovernment; and arbitrary arrest and detention. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation's government, including its level of control, its relationship \nwith the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant's family members and foreign contacts are vulnerable to \ncoercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member or \nfriend is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence collection operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe administratively noticed country conditions in Iraq, such as terrorism, civil unrest, \nand its human-rights record, raise the security concerns to the level of a heightened \nrisk. \nApplicant's mother, two siblings, and a friend with whom he maintains close and \ncontinuing contact, are citizens and residents of Iraq. One of his siblings and the friend \nhave a job that is connected to the Iraqi government. Applicant's connection to his Iraqi \nfamily members and friend presents a potential conflict of interest. As a matter of \ncommon sense and human experience there is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, their immediate family members and \nlongstanding friends. Application of the AG is not a comment on an applicant's \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family \nmember. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant co-owns a piece of real property in Iraq that has \na value of about a $600,000. While he may have inheritance rights in this property that \nare relevant to mitigation, the record evidence demonstrates that he does not own the \nreal property. I therefore find SOR \u00b6 1.e for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAt the outset, I find that Applicant\u2019s contact with his friend who is a teacher in Iraq \nis so casual that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. I find he has mitigated the security concerns with respect to the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nCountry conditions in Iraq raise security concerns to the level of a heightened \nrisk. Applicant has several immediate family members in Iraq with whom he maintains \nclose and frequent contact. He also has a significant number of extended family in Iraq. \nTwo of his family members are reliant on the Iraqi Government for income. While he \ndoes not currently own any property in Iraq, his potential future inheritance rights involve \nsubstantial property interests there. He has shown an interest in protecting his potential \nfuture ownership rights in these properties. He has lived about 75 percent of his life in \nIraq. He has no family who are citizens of the United States and no family who reside \nhere. While he owns a car, has small investments, and a job in the U.S., he owns no \nreal property here. The value of his U.S. based property is not significant when \ncompared to his potential property rights in Iraq. I find that he has failed to provide \nsufficient evidence that any of the Guideline B mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the concerns about foreign preference stating: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S.\nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the\nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not\ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at\nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or\nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law.   \nThe Government alleges that Applicant used his Iraqi citizenship to protect his \nfinancial interests in Iraq. He may be using his Iraqi citizenship to protect his inheritance \ninterest in Iraqi real property because at one time, he did not want to renounce his Iraqi \ncitizenship to keep that potential interest. However, there is no evidence in the record \nthat this action violates U.S. law. I find the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 10(e) is not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B and Guideline C in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The foreign preference security \nconcerns were not established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nSubparagraph 1.d-1.e: \nParagraph 2, Guideline C: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. \n65) The SOR alleges the following financial concerns: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant has two student-loan accounts placed for \ncollection for $29,748 and $28,579. He attended a university from 2001 to 2004 and April \nto October 2017. (Tr. 22) His student loans were borrowed to fund his 2001 to 2004 \nuniversity attendance. (Tr. 29) He made some payments on his student loans starting \nshortly after graduation until about 2013. (Tr. 30-31) He stopped making payments around \n2013 when he was getting divorced and became unemployed. (Tr. 32, 42) Around 2013 \nor 2015, the creditor advised him that he could rehabilitate his student-loan debt if he \nmade consistent payments for six months. (Tr. 33) In 2017, he made an effort to find out \nthe creditor holding his student loans; however, he was unsuccessful. (Tr. 34) In 2019, \nhe learned DoED held his student loans. (Tr. 35) \nApplicant said he applied for the federal loan forgiveness program. (HE 3) In \nFebruary 2020, his loans were placed into forbearance and interest on his loans was \nstopped. (Id.) In August 2022, he applied for the loan rehabilitation and consolidation \nprogram. (Tr. 37-38; HE 3) He believes he has been approved for the DoED income \ndriven repayment plan. (Tr. 36, 38) He is waiting to learn what his payments will be. (Tr. \n36; HE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s October 28, 2022 credit bureau report shows DoED student-loan \naccounts with balances of $29,748 and $28,579 and two payments from 2018 to 2022 on \nthe first account, and one payment from 2018 to 2022 on the second account was made \non time. (HE 3 at pages 10-11 of 16) He admitted he had not made payments on his \nstudent loans for three or five years. (Tr. 66-67) He was unsure whether any payments \nwere made after 2012. (Tr. 66) On May 8, 2023, DoED wrote Applicant and explained \nthat three of his student loans of unspecified amounts were taken out of default status \nand designated to be in good standing. (AE B) DoED would contact Applicant in the future \nto establish a payment plan. (Id.) On August 23, 2023, DoED said they were providing a \nrepayment schedule for his student loans. (AE B) Applicant\u2019s submission did not show \nthe amounts owed on the loans or the amount of his monthly payments. (Id.) After his \nhearing, Applicant said, \u201cAfter years of inaction, I have taken steps to enroll in a structured \npayment plan for my delinquent student loans. This decision reflects my genuine \ncommitment to rectifying outstanding debts in a responsible and timely manner.\u201d (AE C) \nHe did not submit any evidence of payments in 2023. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e allege Applicant has two child-support debts placed for \ncollection for $21,665 and $34,033. He had child-support debts from two different states. \n(Tr. 44) He said he currently has only one child-support debt because the larger debt was \npaid. (Tr. 44-45) The balance on the lesser debt at the time he responded to the SOR \nwas $19,691. (Tr. 42, 46; HE 3) His pay was garnished to pay his child-support debt. (Tr. \n45-46) His monthly payments of $302 are being automatically made from his monthly pay. \n(HE 3) His October 28, 2022 Equifax credit bureau report shows a closed child-support \naccount with a balance of $20,132, and a paid as agreed child-support account with a \nzero balance. (HE 3 at pages 7-8 of 16) On September 21, 2023, he owed $17,786 to \none child-support creditor.

(Tr. 71) His October 28, 2022 Equifax credit bureau report shows the \n$336 account is paid, and the $115 debt is not listed on the credit report. (HE 3 at pages \n5, 12 of 16) He said he referred the debts to his dental insurance company, and he \nbelieves the two debts are resolved. (Tr. 71-72) Applicant is credited with mitigating these \ntwo debts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant has a debt placed for collection for $7,172. He \ncosigned on a loan to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 47) He returned the vehicle and contended \nhe should not have to pay the loan because he did not have possession of the vehicle. \n(Tr. 47) He disputed the debt on his credit report, and it was removed. (Tr. 47-48) The \nlast time he checked on the status of the debt before his hearing was in 2019. (Tr. 49) He \nprovided the contact information to the creditor of the person who was primarily \nresponsible for the debt. (Tr. 9) He was unable to obtain the original documents \nconcerning the debt. (Tr. 49). After his hearing he did not provide any documentation \nconcerning this account. He said: \nAdditionally, there is an ongoing issue with [this account], which has been \nsold to another debt collector. Despite my diligent efforts, I have been \nunable to secure any documents conclusively establishing my responsibility \nfor this debt. I am actively working to resolve this discrepancy, but my \nprogress has been hindered by the absence of supporting documentation \nfrom the debt collector. (AE C)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant has a telecommunications debt placed for collection \nfor $4,317. He said the debt was his debt. (Tr. 50-51) He disputed the debt\u2019s presence on \nhis credit report. (Tr. 52) The debt does not appear on his current credit report. (Tr. 57) \nAfter his hearing, he said, \u201cI would also like to clarify that the [account in SOR \u00b6 1.h is] \nnot in my name, and I have no legal or financial responsibility for [it].\u201d (AE C) He did not \nprovide supporting documentation showing he was not financially responsible for this \ndebt. \nApplicant has a delinquent federal tax debt of about $5,000 from around tax years \n(TY) 2013 to 2015. (Tr. 53) He and his former spouse both took the deductions for their \nchildren, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) credited the deductions to his former \nspouse. (Tr. 53-54) The IRS contacted him around 2018 or 2019 about the additional \ntaxes he owed. (Tr. 54) The IRS applied his refund for TY 2020 to his tax debt. (Tr. 55-\n56) He said he would provide a letter from the IRS indicating the IRS agreed to resolve \nthe debt through future tax refunds; however, he did not provide the letter or agreement \nfrom the IRS.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \napplicable in this case are as follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating\nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information.

However, the Appeal Board clarified that even in instances \nwhere an applicant has purportedly corrected his or her financial problem, and the fact \nthat applicant is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude \ncareful consideration of applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. \nJune 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of \nconduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support \napproval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns \nafter receipt of the SOR). \nUnder all the circumstances, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old engineering communications specialist. He has worked \nfor his current employer since June of 2023. In 2004, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncomputer information science. From 2017 to present, he worked for seven different \nemployers. He provided a resume detailing his professional experience. He honorably \nserved in the Navy from 1987 to 1994. He was discharged from the Navy as a petty officer \nsecond class. He provided some important mitigating information, which is discussed in \nthe financial considerations mitigation analysis section, supra. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time \nthan the evidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to establish \na payment plan to address his federal income tax debt of about $5,000 and his student \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nloan debts.

His failure to take timely, prudent, responsible, good-faith financial actions on the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h, and his tax debt raise unmitigated questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

He is a first-time applicant for \nsecurity clearance. Successfully vetting for a clearance is a requirement of his \ncontinued employment. His employer has given him until January 24, 2023 to have his \nclearance issues resolved or face termination. (Tr. 13-18; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1992.

His wife is \nemployed full-time as an assembler in the private sector. (Tr. 20-22) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists nine allegations under this concern. These allegations are \nestablished by his July 16, 2019 SF-86; his September 23, 2019 Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) Personal Subject Interview (PSI); his September 1, 2022 SOR \nAnswer; his August 6, 2019, February 6, 2020, May 20, 2022, and October 26, 2022 \ncredit reports; his July 16, 2022 Response to Interrogatories; and his hearing testimony. \n(GE 1 through 7; SOR Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began when his father passed away in 2002, and \nhis mother passed away two years later in 2004. Applicant is one of three children from \na traditional Vietnamese family. The three children split the costs of their parents\u2019 \nfunerals with each contributing $10,000 for their mother\u2019s funeral expenses, and each \ncontributing $15,000 for their father\u2019s funeral expenses. Additionally, the family incurred \nthe further expense to reinter their father next to their mother\u2019s gravesite. (Tr. 22-26) \nApplicant charged his portion of his parents\u2019 funeral costs to his credit cards. (Tr. 26) \nA coworker suggested that Applicant consolidate his credit card debt, which he \ndid with a $25,000 consolidation loan in 2011. (Tr. 26) However, shortly after he took \nout the consolidation loan, he was unemployed and was required to use consolidation \nloan funds to meet living expenses for his family. (Tr. 26) Applicant reported several \nperiods of unemployment on his SF-86: June 2018 to January 2019; September 2015 to \nJune 2016; September 2011 to September 2012; and February 2010 to July 2010. (Tr. \n27-28; GE 1) Applicant drew unemployment compensation during those periods of \nunemployment and his wife continued to work; however, he was never able to recover \nfrom the income shortfalls from his loss of employment. (Tr. 28-29) In short, the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunplanned expenses for the funerals of both of his parents within a two-year period, and \nfour periods of unemployment were circumstances beyond his control. (Tr. 29) \nUp until 2019, Applicant was current on his bills, but he was carrying significant \ndebt. (Tr. 34-35) In 2019, before he started his current job, he consulted a debt relief \ncompany (DRC) that advised him to stop paying his debts. Their counsel was that when \nhis debts became delinquent, the DRC could negotiate settlements with his various \ncreditors. However, shortly after discussing a recovery plan with the DRC, Applicant\u2019s \nwife was laid off due to Covid, and he was unable to afford the DRC monthly payments. \n(Tr. 39-40) \nOn July 16, 2022, Applicant entered into a 44-month plan with a debt \nconsolidation company (DCC), approximately one month before his August 24, 2022 \nSOR was issued. He pays $393 by direct debit to the DCC on the 15th  and 30th  of each \nmonth.  He provided documentation of making timely payments to the DCC. The DCC \nuses these funds to pay off and/or settle his enrolled debts. (Tr. 38-39; AE C-1, AE C-2, \nAE C-3, AE C-4, AE C-5, AE C-6) Later, on November 9, 2022, Applicant signed an \nagreement with a law firm (LF) to resolve three of his SOR debts that evolved into civil \nlawsuits. (AE B-2, AE B-3) The applicability of these agreements are discussed further \nbelow. \nThe following is a summary of Applicant\u2019s nine SOR allegations and their status: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Charged-off credit card account for iPhone promotion in the \namount of $3,602. This debt is enrolled with the DCC and will be settled and/or paid as \nfunds become available.

(Tr. 69-72; AE A-\n1 \u2013 A-6)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) are fully applicable. The funeral expenses \nassociated with the passing of Applicant\u2019s parents, and four periods of unemployment \nfor himself and one period of unemployment for his wife, were all circumstances beyond \nhis control. Applicant sought financial counseling with his DCC, and he is diligently \nmaking monthly payments to the DCC to underwrite the costs of settling his delinquent \ndebts. He has paid off two of his SOR debts. He has retained LF to address the three \ncreditors who have filed judgments against him. Applicant has demonstrated through his \nactions that he is determined to overcome his indebtedness. He knows that regaining \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial responsibility is essential to qualify for a security clearance and has taken \nreasonable and measured steps to resolve his debts. \nApplicant entered into an agreement with a DCC to settle and/or pay off his debts \none month before his SOR was issued. Given his available financial resources, the \nrecords support the fact that he is doing his best to pay off the creditors. The Appeal \nBoard has established the following basic guidance for adjudications in cases such as \nthis: \nan applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations \nomitted). \nWhen taking into account Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view his corrective \nefforts to be reasonable and responsible. He paid off two of his nine SOR debts and has \na plan in place to resolve his remaining seven debts. Given the progress Applicant had \nmade and continues to make, he should be debt-free before his 44-month agreement \nwith the DCC expires. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.

However, \nfurther comments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. \nTo review, Applicant is a 48-year-old sheet metal mechanic work lead, who has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor since August 2019. He fell into debt after a \nseries of events beyond his control, and has taken reasonable and measured steps to \nregain financial responsibility. He recognized the importance of regaining financial \nresponsibility, not only for purposes of obtaining a clearance, but also going forward as \na productive member of society. He accepts responsibility for his debts and is \ncommitted to doing the right thing by his creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s approach to resolving his debts is measured and responsible. I was \nimpressed with his demeanor and sincerity. It is clear from his actions that he is \ndetermined to regain financial responsibility. He is well regarded by his employer. He \nand his spouse have jobs that will provide them with the income to repay their creditors. \nApplicant understands what he needs to do to maintain financial responsibility. His \nefforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \nrepayment. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other \nwitnesses or any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until September 7, 2023, \nto enable him to submit documentary evidence.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old fiber optics technician employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 2020 (Tr. 15) He has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant attended a community college from July 2010 to May 2013 and January \n2016 to May 2016, but he has not obtained a degree. He married in November 2012 and \nseparated on a date not reflected in the record. He testified that he was divorced but could \nnot recall when it occurred.

He did not disclose illegally \nusing any other controlled substances. \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2022, Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana twice a month from January 2006 to January 2007. He admitted using \nOxycontin once a week from September 2013 to January 2014 and three times a week \nin December 2017. (GX 3 at 4.) He declared that he did not intend to use marijuana in \nthe future. (GX 3 at 6) At the hearing, he testified that he last used marijuana around \n2020. (Tr. 16) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR in December 2022, he admitted using opioids, \nincluding Oxycontin, Percocet, and Roxicodone on various occasions between 2007 and \nDecember 2017, using cocaine in 2007, abusing Adderall in 2012, and using LSD on \nvarious occasions until 2017. He also admitted using mushrooms on one occasion in \n2006. He denied using phencyclidine (PCP), but he admitted that it was possible that \nother drugs were laced with PCP. He admitted that in October 2012, he was diagnosed \nwith cannabis dependence, that in December 2017 he was diagnosed with \nopiate/benzodiazepine dependence and sedative/hypnotic dependence, that his \ndependence was continuous and severe, and that his prognosis was fair. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he used Adderall in high school in greater quantities than \nprescribed, and he continued to use it in college. He also started stealing opioids from \nhis father, who had a prescription for them, and used them to counteract the Adderall. (Tr. \n18) \nIn 2007, Applicant \u201cthrew a fit\u201d because his parents would not give him the keys to \nthe family car. His parents called the police, and he was charged with disorderly conduct. \nThe charges were dismissed. (Tr. 21-22; GX 9 at 5) He was admitted into a behavioral \nhealth center for three days and diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, single \nepisode, severe; cocaine abuse; opiate abuse; and cannabis abuse. His prognosis was \n\u201cgood with adequate follow up and support.\u201d (GX 5) \nIn 2012, Applicant punched his father in the face because of something that his \nfather said. His father was in a wheelchair at the time. (Tr. 39) Applicant was charged with \nassault and battery on a family member. He spent a week in jail. He was convicted, \nadjudication was deferred, and he was required to complete anger management training. \n(GX 9 at 5) \nIn October 2012, after the incident with his father, Applicant was involuntarily \nadmitted to a psychiatric center and diagnosed with major depressive disorder, \ngeneralized anxiety disorder, and cannabis dependence. He did not complete this \ntreatment program. He was discharged in August 2013 because he stopped attending \nappointments and did not respond to efforts to contact him. (GX 6) The records of the \npsychiatric center do not include a prognosis. \nIn May 2013, Applicant was charged with destruction of property. He testified that \nafter he and his father had an argument, he broke a handrail in the house. He testified \nthat at that time, he would sometimes break something when he was angry. (Tr. 43) He \nfailed to appear in court, was convicted of contempt of court, and was sentenced to 90 \ndays in jail, suspended for 90 days. (GX 4 at 6) \nIn mid-2016, Applicant\u2019s father committed suicide. Applicant went into \u201cdeep \ndepression\u201d and resumed use of opioids. On December 15, 2017, he self-admitted into a \npsychiatric center for opioid detoxication. On admission, he was diagnosed with opioid \nwithdrawal, sedative hypnotic withdrawal, opioid use disorder, benzodiazepine use \ndisorder, sedative hypnotic use disorder, substance induced mood disorder, and anxiety \ndisorder not otherwise specified. (GX 7 at 4) He was discharged on December 29, 2017, \nand diagnosed with opiate dependence, continuous, severe; sedative and hypnotic \ndependence, continuous, severe; and generalized anxiety disorder. (GX 7 at 41) His \nprognosis was \u201cfair.\u201d (GX 7 at 6) \nAfter Applicant was discharged from the psychiatric center, he was referred to a \npsychiatric nurse practitioner, and he began participating in group therapy in January \n2018. His diagnosis upon admission was opioid dependance, uncomplicated; and \nsedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic dependence, uncomplicated.

(GX 8 at 47) Group members were required to attend \nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) three times a \nweek. In November 2018, the psychiatric nurse practitioner suspected that some of the \nsignatures on his NA attendance sheets appeared to have been forged. Applicant denied \nforging signatures, and the issue was not resolved. (GX 8 at 80) During the treatment \nprogram, he tested positive for marijuana at least twice. (GX 8 at 48) He actively \nparticipated in the group therapy sessions. The group therapy records reflect that \nApplicant was admonished frequently to follow medication instructions and advised him \nagainst premature tapering off the use of drugs to control the craving for opioids. (GX 8 \nat 82) At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he stopped taking the drugs sooner than his \ntherapist recommended and contrary to the advice of his peer support group. He \nconsiders himself \u201ccompletely clean.\u201d (Tr. 32) The records of the group therapy facility do \nnot include a prognosis. \nIn June 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a board-certified psychologist at the \nrequest of the DCSA CAS. (GX 4) The psychologist had him complete a personality \nassessment inventory (PAI). The psychologist noted that Applicant responded to items \ncarelessly and did not pay attention to the content of the questions. He attributed \nApplicant\u2019s answers in the PAI were due to \u201cgeneral carelessness, reading problems, \nattention problems, or idiosyncratic thinking.\u201d The psychologist concluded that the PAI \nwas invalid because Applicant\u2019s responses to questions were \u201cindicative of respondents \nwho attempt to portray themselves in the most positive light and exceptionally free of the \ncommon shortcomings to which most others will admit.\u201d \nThe psychologist also noted that Applicant \u201cwas not highly motivated to put forth \nthe mental energy needed to provide a detailed accounting of his mental health and \nsubstance us history and treatment history.\u201d Instead, Applicant simply referred to his SCA \nand report of investigation multiple times as the source of information that the \npsychologist asked for. \nApplicant told the psychologist that he stopped using marijuana when he was hired \nby his current employer in September 2020, but later in the interview he admitted that he \nhad \u201csmoked weed here and there\u201d since he was hired. (GX 4 at 4) He admitted to the \npsychologist that he stopped taking the opioid-withdrawal drugs sooner than his therapist \nrecommended and contrary to the advice of his peer support group. The psychologist \nreported that it was difficult to fully understand Applicant\u2019s current substance-abuse \nstatus, because the information he provided during the assessment was inconsistent with \npast records (such as his SCA and responses to interrogatories) and his own statements \nduring the assessment. He noted that there was \u201chard evidence\u201d that Applicant had \nrecovered from his last episode of opioid abuse, but there was also evidence that he did \nnot follow the treatment recommendations from his last treatment that ended in December \n2018. The psychologist concluded: \nAt best, [Applicant] has abstained from opioid and other drug use since 2017 \nand from marijuana use since 2020. At worst, he misrepresented himself to \nme and he continues to use illegal drugs and/or misuse prescription drugs \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith an unknown frequency and intensity. . . .

I am simply unable to tell. \nThe psychologist concluded, \u201cThe results of the present evaluation are inconclusive \nregarding whether [Applicant] has any active mental health or substance abuse condition \nthat could negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in safeguarding \nnational security information.\u201d (GX 4 at 6-7) \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend since December 2020 met him while they were both working \nfor his current employer. She regards him as a kind and loving person who is \u201calways \ntrying to improve himself despite the things he did in the past.\u201d She believes that he has \ngrown into a \u201chealthy and reliable person, coworker, and future husband.\u201d (AX A) \nApplicant\u2019s lifelong friend, who now shares an apartment with him, has known him \nsince they were teenagers. He witnessed Applicant\u2019s \u201cblatant disregard for himself and \nothers around him, destructive behavior, and rampant substance abuse.\u201d He believes that \nApplicant has \u201cboth figuratively and literally turned his life around in roaring totality for the \nbetter.\u201d Although Applicant was told that he would \u201cnever be employed, never free of \ndrugs, and never worth of affection,\u201d he now \u201chas a great job, is long-term free of drugs, \nand is in a health relationship.\u201d (AX C) \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother believes that the turning point in Applicant\u2019s life was \nthe passing of their father. He describes the changes in Applicant\u2019s behavior as \u201csomeone \nthat was on the path of self-destruction to someone [who] leads the path of self-\nimprovement.\u201d He considers Applicant a role model to any who wishes to better \nthemselves and enjoy a happy, successful adulthood. (AX D) \nApplicant\u2019s mother states that she has watched him completely transform during \nthe past ten years, when her view of him was \u201cmurky at best\u201d to the present. He now talks \nabout things that she never dreamed possible for him. (AX E) Applicant\u2019s former wife, \nwho maintains a \u201cstrong friendship\u201d with him, believes that he has undergone a significant \npositive transformation after the passing of his father. He now handles his mother\u2019s \nfinancial matters and has shown no interest in drugs. (AX G) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s coworkers, who has known him for the past year, describes him \nas \u201can individual who shows up earlier than asked, works hard, and carries [himself] in a \npolite, respectable manner.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline except SOR \u00b6 1.g, \nalleging use of PCP, which he denied. There is no evidence showing that he knowingly \nused PCP. Therefore, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.g in his favor.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought.

Thus, \nI have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. The evidence supporting SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c \nis sufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) are established. Separate from the multiple drug-\nrelated diagnoses, Applicant has been repeatedly diagnosed with mental conditions \nrelated to his behavior. In 2007, he was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. In \n2012, he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. \nIn 2016, he was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is established. Applicant was admitted to a behavioral health center in \n2007, a psychiatric center in 2012, and a psychiatric center in 2017. \nAG \u00b6 28(d) (\u201cfailure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed medication or \nfailure to attend required counseling sessions.\u201d) is relevant but not alleged. While in group \ntherapy in 2018, Applicant failed to follow the medication schedule for weaning himself \nfrom opioids. Because his failure to do so is not alleged in the SOR, I have considered \nthe unalleged conduct it for the limited purposes set out above. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s conditions are treatable, but he has not \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his most recent treatment plan. \nContrary to the recommendation of a psychiatric nurse practitioner and his group therapy \npeer group, he accelerated his use of opioid-withdrawal drugs and terminated his use of \nthem prematurely. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c), 29(d), and 29(e) are not established. The psychologist who \nconducted the mental health evaluation for the CAS was unable to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s condition was under control or in remission. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l and 2.a-2.d (SOR \u00b6 \n3.a). In addition, it alleges that Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct in \nDecember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.b), charged with assault and battery in March 2008 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.c), charged with assault and battery in March 2012 (SOR \u00b6 3.d), charged with \ndestruction of property (SOR \u00b6 3.e), charged with failure to appear in February 2014 (SOR \n\u00b6 3.f), and charged with contempt of court (SOR \u00b6 3.g). \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to disclose material facts in his April \n2019 SCA (SOR \u00b6 3.h), failed to disclose material facts in his responses to interrogatories \nin September 2022 (SOR \u00b6 3.i), and failed to disclose material facts during his \npsychological evaluation in June 2022 (SOR \u00b6 3.j). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification.

He also admitted \nthat in his responses to interrogatories, he did not disclose his use of Oxycontin and \nmarijuana more extensively than he admitted. He explained that he was young, not in a \nsober mindset, and did not know what drugs were in his system when he was tested. \nHowever, his admissions to the Guideline H allegations establish that he knew what he \nhad used. \nThe psychologist\u2019s observations about Applicant\u2019s carelessness and inattention to \nthe questions in the PAI suggest that the same carelessness may have contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s incomplete answers to the questions in the SCA and the interrogatories. On \nthe other hand, the psychologist also noted Applicant\u2019s tendency to answer questions in \nthe light most favorable to him, which suggests that Applicant was trying to minimize his \nculpability when he submitted his SCA and answered the DOHA interrogatories. \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant intentionally skewed the results of the \nPAI. His report does not recite any specific inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s medical \nrecords and the information that he provided during the psychological evaluation. He \nreported that Applicant seemed ill-prepared to discuss his medical history in detail and \nwas sometimes evasive about it. He noted that Applicant responded to questions by \nreferring to his answers in the SCA, which were false. He specifically noted that Applicant \ntold him that he stopped using marijuana when he was hired by his current employer in \nSeptember 2020 but later admitted using marijuana after he was hired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established for Applicant\u2019s omissions from his SCA and DOHA \ninterrogatories. Applicant made no attempt to correct his SCA or his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories until he was confronted with the evidence. However, AG \u00b6 17(a) is \nestablished for his claim during his psychological evaluation that he stopped using \nmarijuana in September, which he promptly corrected later in the interview. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Falsification during a security-clearance adjudication \nis not \u201cminor.\u201d It is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of the security clearance \nadjudication process. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, I, and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his drug involvement, psychological conditions, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I, (Psychological Conditions ): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 25) After a brief discussion, \nthe technical sergeant told Applicant, who was a senior airman (E-4), to come into the \noffice. (Tr. 25) Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, a staff sergeant (E-5) was in the office \nas an observer. (Tr. 27) Once they were in the office, the argument became heated, and \nApplicant threatened to \u201ctake his supervisor out now.\u201d (Tr. 23-24, 27) Applicant said he \nwas inconsolable; however, he did not actually intend to kill his supervisor. (Tr. 28) His \nsupervisor suggested that he obtain counseling. (Tr. 30) He received counseling, and he \nwas prescribed Wellbutrin for anxiety. (Tr. 33-34) He took Wellbutrin for about two \nmonths. (Tr. 33-34) He had side effects, including headaches, and he had another \noutburst in the middle of a physical training session. (Tr. 34) He was advised to stop taking \nit.

(Tr. 33) During his follow-up \ntreatment, he was possibly diagnosed with Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. (Tr. 31) \nIn March 2010, Applicant was assigned to an Air Force base in the United States, \nand he was scheduled to deploy overseas. (Tr. 37-38) He was worried that he might have \na nervous breakdown if he was around the wrong people, and he advised his command \nthat he may have problems if he is deployed. (Tr. 37-39) A March 2, 2010 medical note \nstates: \nPt stated his anxiety interferes with his everyday activities. He stated he is \nsocial[ly] isolated from everyday activities. Member prefers to stay at his \nresidence for fear of anxiety of what others will think. Pt stated his anxiety \nis so severe he cannot go into a store by himself. . . . Pt reported he was \ntaking psychotropic medications for his issues but felt they did not work and \ngave him headaches. Pt reported he did not have a very close relationship \nwith his family. . . . Pt reported having severe anger issues to the point of \nkick[ing] and throwing stuff. His last reported episode of getting angry was \na few weeks ago at a fellow co-worker. Pt reported sleeping 2-3 hrs a night \nand eating only one meal a day. Pt stated he has passive [suicidal ideation] \n(not currently) but denies any suicidal plan, intent or urges. Pt denied \nhomicidal ideation/plan/intent/urges. (Tr. 44; GE 6 at 46) \nApplicant said the March 2, 2010 medical note was accurate. (Tr. 45) In June 2010, his \ntreating physician prescribed Zoloft; however, it was not effective, and Applicant had \nheadaches. (Tr. 45-46; GE 6 at 21) Applicant did not accept and comply with the medical \nadvice.

(Tr. 50) \nA September 15, 2010 medical note indicates he was prescribed Prozac; however, he \nnever picked up his Prozac because he does not like taking psychiatric medications. (Tr. \n47; GE 6 at 16) He did not take any medications after September 2010. (Tr. 50) He \nstopped seeing a mental-health practitioner in October 2010.

The next medical note is Applicant was a \u201cno \nshow\u201d for an appointment on November 8, 2012. (Id. at 1) At his hearing, Applicant said \nhe did not remember why he sought treatment in October 2012. (Tr. 55) \nAnger management was suggested for Applicant; however, he never received \nanger management counseling. (Tr. 59) He said, \u201cMy anger outbursts always coincided \nwith quite a bit of hostility towards me or pressure or something along those lines. I just \ndon\u2019t get randomly angry.\u201d (Tr. 59) He described his outbursts as a defensive response \nor mechanism to being patronized or \u201cganged up on.\u201d (Tr. 76) His response is to \n\u201crandomly say stuff.\u201d (Tr. 76) His responses are primarily verbal outbursts, and he has \nnever harmed anyone. (Tr. 77-78) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in about November 2018, Applicant attempted suicide. During \nhis follow-up hospitalization, he was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder, Unspecified \nPersonality Disorder with Borderline Traits, and Social Anxiety Disorder. In his SOR \nresponse, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d without any elaboration or explanation. \nApplicant has experienced suicidal ideations periodically from high school to the\npresent day. (Tr. 64-65) In November 2018, Applicant\u2019s long-term girlfriend (five years) \ntexted him that their relationship was over, and he went home and discovered her \nbelongings were gone as well as most of the household items. (Tr. 60; GE 5 at 1) He \nvideotaped a 10-minute will. (GE 4 at 5) He was overwhelmed and triggered. (Tr. 60) He \nwent to sleep, and when he woke up, he took a steak knife and superficially cut his wrists. \n(Tr. 61; GE 5 at 1) He sent a message on the Internet, and a police officer took him to the \nhospital, where he was admitted as an inpatient from November 28 to 30, 2018.

(SOR \nresponse) He was dissatisfied with previous mental-health counseling because when he \nreceived counseling, the mental-health professional \u201cjust wants to toss medication\u201d at \nhim. (Id.) He was advised that treatment was voluntary, and he was not told his security \nclearance was jeopardized by not accepting medication. (Id.) He requested a second \nevaluation. (Id.) \nWhen Applicant is in unfamiliar surroundings or is engaged in something \nunplanned, he gets \u201cvery shaky and nervous,\u201d and his voice slurs and he slightly stutters. \n(Tr. 40) He avoids situations where he feels stress. (Tr. 40) His most recent verbal\noutburst was in late 2018 or early 2019 when he made comments to his boss. (Tr. 79)\n \n \nApplicant decided not to seek professional assistance in dealing with his stress \nand anxiety after he received the SOR because he \u201cneeded to handle it\u201d himself. (Tr. 69, \n73) After he received the SOR, he was concerned seeking help might be viewed as his \nacceptance that he had \u201cpsychopathy,\u201d that he was \u201cweak minded,\u201d or that he was \n\u201cregressing\u201d because of the timing. (Tr. 74-75) He plans to seek counseling in the future\nbecause his security clearance issue has prompted him to resume treatment in the future.\n(Tr. 70-71) He said he intends to seek \u201cvalidation for what I\u2019m doing or to see if there\u2019s \nsomething that I\u2019m doing wrong or what have you.\u201d (Tr. 72) If he really needed help, he \nwould seek it.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), and 28(d) are established. The disqualifying conditions \nwill be discussed in the mitigating conditions section, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nIn about 2004, Applicant was referred for mental-health treatment after he told his \nAir Force supervisor that he thought about killing him and that he should have killed him \nor words to that effect. He has subsequently had occasional angry outbursts; however, \nthe ones after 2004 were not as significant and did not involve threats. His outbursts are \nsufficient to establish AG \u00b6 28(a) by history; however, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are mitigated \nbecause there is no indication of a current problem with angry outbursts to the degree of \nraising a security concern. See AG \u00b6 29(e). \nAn October 29, 2010 medical note states, \u201cPt [states] he no longer wishes to \ncontinue mental health treatment, despite no change in his poorly controlled social \nanxiety [signs and symptoms]. Strongly recommend to pt that he reconsider his decision. \nPt [states] he is sure about his current decision to terminate treatment.\u201d (Tr. 53; GE 6 at \n7) After a suicide attempt in which he made superficial cuts to his wrists, he received \ninpatient mental-health treatment from November 28 to 30, 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(c) and 28(d) \nare established. \nOn June 20, 2022, Dr. S diagnosed Applicant with: Social Anxiety Disorder, and \nPersonality Disorder, Unspecified with Borderline Features (by history).

He summarized his report as follows:  \n[Applicant\u2019s] recurring suicidal ideation depression, poor engagement in, \nand follow through with psychiatric treatment, and his endorsement of \nsevere psychopathology on the MMPI-3 indicate the presence of significant \nmental health concerns and the need for current, ongoing, engagement in \nmental health services (i.e. therapy, medication management, etc.). (GE 3 \nat 5) \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is established. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant \ndid not establish \u201congoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan,\u201d see AG \u00b6 \n29(a). He is not \u201ccurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified mental health professional,\u201d see AG \u00b6 29(b). He did not provide a \n\u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or acceptable \nto and approved by, the U.S. Government that [his] previous condition is under control or \nin remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation,\u201d see AG \u00b6 29(c). \nHe did not establish \u201cthe past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and [he] no longer shows indications of emotional instability,\u201d \nsee AG \u00b6 29(d). He did not prove \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem,\u201d see AG \u00b6 \n29(e). \nI have lingering concerns that Applicant will again be under stress in a social \nsituation, and he will make poor security-related decisions. Mental-health problems could \nresurface even without him being in a stressful situation. Without ongoing therapy or \ncounseling as Dr. S recommended, there is insufficient assurance that his mental-health \nproblems will not recur. Psychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline I are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old technician for various training devices for complex \naviation systems. In 2017, he received an associate degree in programming and game \ndesign, and in 2001, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics engineering. He \nserved in the Air Force from 2002 to 2014, and he received an honorable discharge. \nWhen he was discharged from the Air Force, he was a staff sergeant. He did not receive \nany nonjudicial punishments while in the Air Force. The VA has awarded him a 70 percent \ndisability rating, which includes 50 percent for adjustment disorder and anxiety disorder. \nThere is no evidence of drug or alcohol abuse, or security violations. \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive. On June 20, 2022, Dr. S evaluated Applicant on behalf of the CAF. Dr. S \ndiagnosed him with: Social Anxiety Disorder and Personality Disorder, Unspecified with \nBorderline Features (by history). Dr. S concluded his suicidal ideation, depression, and \npossible personality disorder \u201ccould negatively impact his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in safeguarding classified information or working in a cleared setting.\u201d (GE \n3 at 5) Dr. S said he had \u201chigh confidence\u201d in the accuracy of the information received \nfrom Applicant. He summarized his report as follows: \n[Applicant\u2019s] recurring suicidal ideation depression, poor engagement in, \nand follow through with psychiatric treatment, and his endorsement of \nsevere psychopathology on the MMPI-3 indicate the presence of significant \nmental health concerns and the need for current, ongoing, engagement in \nmental health services (i.e. therapy, medication management, etc.). (GE 3 \nat 5) \nThere is no reason to doubt the accuracy of Dr. S\u2019s evaluation, diagnosis, or \nprognosis. There is no mental-health diagnosis or prognosis from a qualified mental-\nhealth professional that undermines or contradicts Dr. S\u2019s evaluation. At the time of his \nsecurity clearance hearing, Applicant did not receive mental-health counseling or \ntreatment after Dr. S\u2019s evaluation. His consideration of resuming mental-health \ncounseling or treatment after his hearing is a positive step towards future reinstatement \nof his security clearance. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.
