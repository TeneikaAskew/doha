Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 19, 2006. On \nMarch 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nOctober 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 3, 2009; answered it on April 11, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing on the record without a hearing. DOHA received the request on \nApril 15, 2009. Department Counsel requested a hearing (Tr. 13) and was ready to \nproceed on July 1, 2009. The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on July 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 17, 2009. On July \n31, 2009, Applicant retained counsel, and his counsel requested that the hearing be \npostponed because he had conflicting obligations on the scheduled hearing date. I \ngranted the request on August 12, 2009, and on August 18, 2009, DOHA issued a \nsecond notice of hearing, rescheduling the case for September 21, 2009. I convened \nthe hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nand B, which were admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of \nthe hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 24, 2009. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the first sentence of SOR \u00b6 2.a by \ninserting the words, \u201cby answering \u2018no,\u2019\u201d after the words and figures, \u201cSeptember 10, \n2006,\u201d and by amending the last sentence of SOR \u00b6 2.a to read as follows: \u201cYou \ndeliberately failed to disclose that you engaged in conduct as set forth above in 1.a \nthrough 1.b.\u201d Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 14-16). The \namendments are handwritten on the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nHe admitted answering \u201cno\u201d to the questions on his security clearance application about \ndrug involvement, but he denied intending to deceive. His admissions in his answer and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old driver and general clerk employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2005. He attended \nhigh school through the 10th grade, received his GED high school equivalency \ncertificate, and attended a vocational school from January through April 1990. He was \nmarried in August 1997 and has no children. He received a favorable trustworthiness \ndetermination from another federal agency in November 2001. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \n \n \nA co-worker for the past three years submitted a statement describing Applicant \nas a trustworthy worker who received positive feedback from his supervisor and \ncustomers (AX A). A former supervisor described him as \u201ca joy to supervise\u201d because of \nhis work ethic and reliability (AX B).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he answered \u201cno\u201d \nto three questions about prior drug involvement (GX 1 at 33). His wife, who is a high \nschool graduate, helped him with the application (Tr. 34). He did not disclose that he \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhad purchased and used marijuana for several years. In his answer to the SOR, he \nstated he answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions because he was not using marijuana at the \ntime he submitted his application (Answer to SOR at 2). He gave the same explanation \nat the hearing (Tr. 29). He denied intentionally falsifying his application (Tr. 32). \nHowever, in response to Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination, he admitted he \nunderstood each of the three questions about controlled substances and he admitted he \nknew he was not answering truthfully when he answered \u201cno\u201d to all three questions (Tr. \n42-45). \n \nApplicant testified he had a problem with marijuana use a \u201cfew years ago,\u201d but he \nno longer has a problem with it (Tr. 30-31). He started using marijuana around 1991 (Tr. \n52). From 1991 to 1995, he used it about every other weekend (Tr. 53). In 1995-1996, \nhe used marijuana once every other month (Tr. 52). From 1996 to 1999, he did not use \nit (Tr. 54). After 1999, he used it only on special occasions (Tr. 55). He admitted he \nused it \u201ca few times\u201d after submitting his security clearance application (Tr. 29-30). He \ndefined \u201ca few times\u201d as \u201cthree to four \u2013 two to three, maybe.\u201d He last used it on New \nYear\u2019s Day 2008 (Tr. 46-47). After he was married, he used marijuana alone on some \noccasions and with his family members on other occasions. He purchased marijuana \nfrom \u201cpeople on the streets\u201d on some occasions and was given marijuana on others. He \ndenied selling or distributing marijuana (Tr. 83). \n \nIn DOHA interrogatories, Applicant was asked about his intentions regarding \nfuture marijuana use. In his response dated May 5, 2008, he stated: \u201cIt\u2019s getting better, \nminimum to none is my goal, as far as frequency is concerned.\u201d He stated he decided to \nstop using marijuana for the sake of his health and his family and to avoid further \ninvolvement with the legal system (GX 2 at 2). At the hearing, he admitted he still is \nattracted to marijuana (Tr. 79). He has not sought or received drug counseling (GX 2 at \n3). He is unwilling to \u201cturn [his] back\u201d on family members and close friends of the family \nwho use marijuana (GX 2 at 3; Tr. 70-74).  \n \n \nOn March 24, 2007, Applicant was charged with distribution of a controlled \nsubstance, possession of marijuana, and having a handgun on his person. The two \ndrug-related charges were disposed of by nolle prosequi. Applicant pleaded not guilty to \nthe handgun offense, and he was placed on probation before judgment, fined $292.50, \nrequired to perform 100 hours of community service, and required to pay court costs of \n$57.50 (GX 6). \n \nApplicant described his arrest on March 24, 2007, as a case of being in the \nwrong place at the wrong time. He and some family members were in a liquor store \nwhen there was a disturbance outside and the police arrived. Applicant was arrested \nand found in possession of three baggies of marijuana and an unregistered handgun. \nHe explained that he intended to use the marijuana at a party. He denied intending to \nsell it. He testified he obtained the handgun for his own protection after being carjacked \nabout a year earlier (Tr. 80-83).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant \u201cused marijuana with varying frequency, to include as \nfrequently as every other weekend, for multiple years up to at least March 8, 2008 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a); purchased marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b); continued to associate with illegal drug users \nas recently as May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and was arrested in March 2007 and charged \nwith distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, possession of marijuana, and \npossession of a handgun on his person (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The concern under this guideline \nis as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 24.  \n \nThis guideline encompasses use or misuse of Adrugs, materials, and other \nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as \namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and \nhallucinogens). AG \u00b6 24(a)(1). Disqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany \ndrug abuse,@ and Aillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c). Drug abuse is Athe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \nThe evidence raises these two disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recentness of drug involvement. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.   \n \nApplicant testified he last used marijuana on New Year\u2019s Day 2008, almost two \nyears ago. While this period of abstinence is \u201ca significant period of time,\u201d it has \noccurred in the context of frequent use for five years, abstinence for three years, and \nresumption of use in 1999. He used it \u201ca few times\u201d after submitting his security \nclearance application. He continues to desire marijuana, and he has not sought or \nreceived counseling. His response to DOHA interrogatories about the likelihood of \nfuture marijuana use was ambivalent. His use did not occur under circumstances \nmaking it unlikely to recur. After considering all the evidence, I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is \nnot established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using \nassociates and contacts;(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; [and] (3) an appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant explained in \nhis answers to DOHA interrogatories that he cannot establish the first two prongs \nbecause his family members are marijuana users. He has not established \u201can \nappropriate period of abstinence,\u201d because he has a history of abstinence and relapse. \nHis last period of sustained abstinence was for about three years, from 1996 to 1999, \nbut he then relapsed and used marijuana after submitting his security clearance \napplication. He has not sought or received drug counseling, and he has no support \nstructure to help him abstain from drug use. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application in \nSeptember 2006 by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions about drug involvement and \nintentionally failing to disclose that he purchased and used marijuana. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a \nfalsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove a \u201cdeliberate omission, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts.\u201d An administrative judge must consider \nthe record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of \nthe omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR and on direct examination at the hearing, Applicant \ndenied intentional falsification. He explained that he answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions \nabout drug involvement because he was not using marijuana at the time he submitted \nhis application. This explanation was implausible and unconvincing. On cross-\nexamination, he admitted he understood the questions and knew that his answers were \nnot truthful. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant \nmade no effort to correct the omission and persisted in his implausible explanation for \nhis omission during his direct testimony at the hearing. He finally admitted his \nfalsification during cross-examination. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s falsification was not minor because it undermined the integrity of the security \nclearance process. It did not occur under unique circumstances. Three years have \npassed, and there is no evidence of similar misconduct, but he persisted in attempting \nto justify his falsification until he was cross-examined at the hearing. Under all the \ncircumstances, it casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 17(c) is not established.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant eventually acknowledged his \nfalsification during cross-examination at the hearing, but there is no evidence of \ncounseling or \u201cother positive steps\u201d to prevent recurrence. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult, but he has spent much of his life involved with illegal \ndrugs, and he lives in a family environment where his drug involvement is acceptable. \nHe has made considerable strides in changing his behavior, but he has not yet \naccomplished his declared goal of living a drug-free life. His lack of candor on his \nsecurity clearance application and his implausible explanations for his falsified \napplication raise serious doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the four debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.r. He denied the remaining SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 44-year-old electrician who has worked for a defense contractor since 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 52) Starting in 1982, Applicant served six years on active duty in the U.S. Army. In 1988, Applicant joined the D.C. Air National Guard. In 1998, Applicant, then an E-5, was discharged from the Air National Guard. (Tr. 51, 104, Answer to SOR) Applicant has been married twice. The date of his first marriage does not appear in the record. His job as an electrician required him to live for various amounts of time at sites in different states away from his home, his wife, and children. In 1998, Applicant left Maryland and lived for a year in South Carolina and Georgia before moving to New Jersey. In 1999, his wife was diagnosed with cancer. (Tr. 107) In 2001, he returned to Maryland because his wife was so sick she was unable to care for their son and daughter, ages 9 and 20. (Tr. 41) During his wife\u2019s illness, a number of medical debts and co-payments were incurred, which have now been paid. In 2003, his first wife died of cancer and in May 2004, he remarried.

His past \ndue student loan is current, he is paying his tax liens, and has paid 13 accounts placed \nfor collection. The judgment and one small additional account remain unpaid. Applicant \nhas successfully mitigated financial considerations and personal conduct security \nconcerns. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 29, 2008, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial \nproblems as evidenced by delinquent debts and Guideline E, personal conduct, for \nfalsified material on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).  \n  \n \nOn November 26, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn April 2, 2009, I was assigned the case. On April 8, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on May 6, 2009. The government offered Exhibits \n(Ex.) 1 through 8, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified and the record \nwas kept open to allow him to submit additional matters. On May 12 and May 13, 2009, \nadditional documents were received. There being no objection, the material was \nadmitted into evidence as Ex. A and Ex. B. On May 18, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the four debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.r. He denied the remaining SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions to \nthe SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \n Applicant is a 44-year-old electrician who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 52) Starting in 1982, \nApplicant served six years on active duty in the U.S. Army. In 1988, Applicant joined the \nD.C. Air National Guard. In 1998, Applicant, then an E-5, was discharged from the Air \nNational Guard. (Tr. 51, 104, Answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice. The date of his first marriage does not appear \nin the record. His job as an electrician required him to live for various amounts of time at \nsites in different states away from his home, his wife, and children. In 1998, Applicant \nleft Maryland and lived for a year in South Carolina and Georgia before moving to New \nJersey. In 1999, his wife was diagnosed with cancer. (Tr. 107) In 2001, he returned to \nMaryland because his wife was so sick she was unable to care for their son and \ndaughter, ages 9 and 20. (Tr. 41) During his wife\u2019s illness, a number of medical debts \nand co-payments were incurred, which have now been paid. In 2003, his first wife died \nof cancer and in May 2004, he remarried. (Tr. 93, Ex. 1) \n \nUnpaid Taxes \n \n In 1999, Applicant was working on a project in New Jersey, rented a room there, \nand paid New Jersey state income tax. After living there a year, one job ended and he \nsecured another job in the same state for another year. (Tr. 120) Although living, \nworking, and paying income tax in New Jersey, Maryland claimed him as a resident and \n \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntaxed him as such. This resulted in a Maryland unpaid tax obligation. He was unaware \nof the tax liens because notices had been sent to his wife, who was living in a different \nstate. Applicant asserts he first learned of the existence of the state income tax liens \nwhen interviewed in 2007 as a result of his clearance application, (Tr. 62)  \n \n \nApplicant is attempting to straighten out what is owed New Jersey and what is \nowed Maryland. (Tr. 121) He asserted the 2002 tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $2,579) was \nincorporated into the 2006 tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.r, $4,131) and only one tax lien now exists. \nSince November 2008, he has made $165 monthly payments on the debt. (Tr. 39, 65) \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated he would send proof of payments and proof of the \ncurrent balance on his state tax lien. (Tr. 92) No documents were received. \n \nRepossessed Vehicle \n \n \n In 1998, when Applicant moved to South Carolina, he left the family vehicle with \nhis wife. Later that year, it was repossessed and resold leaving a balance due. \nHowever, Applicant was unaware of the repossession until years after it occurred (time \nnot identified). The creditor demanded the amount due on the vehicle following the sale. \nApplicant asked for proof as to the value of the car brought at sale. Applicant offered to \nsettle the debt for $6,000, but the creditor demanded $8,000. (Tr. 101) The offer was \nnot accepted. \n \nIn January 2003, the creditor filed a court action with notice sent to Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s Maryland address. At the time the notice was served, Applicant was living in New \nJersey. His wife was sick with cancer and unlikely to pay much attention to the notice. \n(Tr. 107) She died in 2003. In January 2003, the creditor obtained a judgment and lien. \n(Ex. 3, Ex. 5) The exact date as to when Applicant became aware of the judgment is not \npart of the record. In the court action, the creditor claimed the balance owed was \n$5,526. To this amount was added $3,222 interest, $2,187 attorney\u2019s fees and $20 \ncosts. (Ex. 5)  \n \nApplicant asserts he intends to pay the obligation, but does not intend to pay the \namount claimed. (Tr. 46) Since the matter has been reduced to judgment, Applicant has \nno legal justification for paying less than the amount of the judgment nor does the \ncreditor have any reason to compromise on the amount due.  \n \nIn 2003, Applicant was last contacted by the creditor. (Tr. 102) Applicant disputed \nthe auto repossession debt on his credit bureau report (CBR) and it was removed. \nApplicant did not provide no documentation or testimony as to why or how the judgment \nwas disputed, the reason it was deleted from his CBR, nor did he identify the date when \nhe disputed this debt. The debt does not appear on either his October 2008 CBR (Ex. 8) \nor his March 2009 CBR (Ex. 9). Since he disputed the debt, it no longer appeared on his \nCBR, and he had not been contacted by the creditor since 2003, he did not list it in \nOctober 2007 when asked about \u201cunpaid\u201d judgments or repossession on his e-QIP. (Tr. \n78, 80, Ex. 1) Question 27.d did not ask about all judgments filed against Applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nduring the seven years before the e-QIP\u2019s completion, but asked only about \u201cunpaid\u201d \njudgments.  \n \nOn the same e-QIP, Applicant did not list the repossession in response to \nquestion 27.b. In response to question 28.a, Applicant indicated he had been more than \n180 days delinquent on his debts, but listed only a single debt. In response to question \n27.c, he did not list his tax liens because he was unaware of their existence when he \ncompleted the questionnaire. (Tr. 79)  \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant was injured in a serious vehicle accident. (Tr. 53) He \nreceived disability payments for the six months following the accident. He now lives on \nhis wife\u2019s income, what his daughter pays to stay in their home, and social security \n($980 monthly) his son receives from the death of his mother, Applicant\u2019s first wife. (Tr. \n54, 86) His wife\u2019s gross salary is $3,900 per month and her take-home pay is $600 per \nweek. (Tr. 55, 84) Applicant is current on his rent, $500 monthly car payment, two credit \ncard accounts, and utility bills. (Tr. 56, 83, 91) Currently, he is not receiving letters or \ncalls from creditors demanding money. (Tr. 113)  \n \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant responded to written interrogatories. (Ex. 2) Applicant\u2019s \npersonal financial statement showed net monthly income of $6,731, monthly expenses \nof $2,645, monthly debt payment of $766, and net monthly remainder of $3,320. In June \n2008, Applicant applied for a debt consolidation loan, which was later denied. (Tr. 88, \nEx. 2)  \n \n \n Applicant pays $50 monthly on a student loan obligation (SOR \u00b6 1.g). (Tr. 45, \nApplicant\u2019s answer to SOR, see letter dated November 12, 2008.) Applicant\u2019s March \n2009 CBR lists the account as \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d (Ex. 9) There was a misunderstanding \nas to when payments were due, which has been corrected. The loan had been past due \nor delinquent, but is current for the most recent four months. Applicant offered to \nprovide post-hearing documents showing the current status of this loan. (Tr. 94) No \nsupporting documentation about the student loan was received.  \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling from his sister, a former loan officer, \nwho is a training supervisor at a credit union. (Tr. 89, 90)  \n \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s debts follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na Judgment for state tax lien.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant had one unpaid judgment, one past due account, two unpaid tax \nliens, and 14 unpaid accounts placed for collection, which totaled more than $22,000. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s state income tax problems arose because he was living and working \nin one state and his wife and children were living in another state. He paid income tax to \nthe state where he worked, but the other state also claimed taxes were owed to it. Two \ntax liens were entered against Applicant. He currently pays $165 per month on the state \ntax lien and is still pursuing recovery for state taxes paid to the other state. A \nmisunderstanding caused the student loan repayment to become 120 days past due. \nThe misunderstanding has been corrected and Applicant is current on the obligation as \nshown in his CBR, which lists the debt as pays as agreed. \n \n \nApplicant was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident and has been away \nfrom his job for more than one year. Even with his reduced income he was able to pay \n13 accounts which had been placed for collection. The two remaining obligations have \nnot been paid. Applicant has been unsuccessful in locating the current holder of the \nunpaid $159 account (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Having paid the majority of his past due obligations, I \nbelieve he will pay this small debt once he locates the holder of the account.  \n \n \nThe judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.i $10,956) remains unpaid. Applicant currently disputes \nthe amount owed. However, this matter has been reduced to judgment and Applicant \ncan no longer legally dispute the amount owed. Earlier, he offered to settle the matter \nfor $6,000, but the creditor demanded $8,000. Applicant acknowledges he owes the \ncreditor for the repossession vehicle. Applicant paid the majority of the accounts placed \nfor collection; he acknowledges owing this debt, and previously offered $6,000 to settle \nit. For these reasons, it is likely Applicant will pay this debt.  \n \nThe SOR listed 18 unpaid obligations so the behavior cannot be called infrequent \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). However, Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by \nhaving to maintain two households. His wife and children lived in one location and his \nwork took him to various other states. Since he no longer maintains two households, \nthis behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies in part. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b) Applicant experienced additional expenses when his job \nrequired him to maintain two households due to jobs. His wife contracted cancer. She \nwas no longer able to work or care for their children. Plus, additional medical expenses \nwere incurred. These are factors beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Since her death in 2003, \nApplicant has acted responsibly. He has addressed all but two of the debts of concern \nlisted in the SOR. He is current on his monthly obligations. Creditors are not contacting \nhim concerning unpaid obligations. AG & 20(b) applies. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG & 20(c) applies. He has received financial counseling from his sister and \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved, or is under control. He is \npaying his tax lien, student loan obligation, and has paid 13 additional accounts. \nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \nthese 16 debts. AG & 20(d) applies to these 16 debts.  \n \nThe $159 debt is so small as to not raise concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant wants to pay the single, large debt that \nremains. He earlier made an unsuccessful offer to the creditor. Since he has addressed \nthe majority of his debts, I find it is likely he will also pay this debt.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government has shown Applicant's answers to questions 27 and 28 on his \nOctober 2007 e-QIP were incorrect, but this does not prove Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose information about his finances. He failed to indicate he had tax liens, an \nunpaid judgment, or was currently 90 days delinquent on any debt. He indicated he had \nbeen more than 180 days delinquent on his debts, but listed only one debt. \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security clearance, \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. \nApplicant denies he intentionally falsified his answers on the e-QIP. \n \nApplicant\u2019s first wife and children lived in one state and Applicant lived in another. \nNotices of the tax liens and judgment were sent to his wife\u2019s address. Applicant, since \nhe was not living there, did not receive the notices when they were issued. At the time \nthe notices were received by his wife, she was suffering from cancer, and it is unlikely \nshe was focused on the family\u2019s finances. It was not until 2007, during his interview in \nconnection with the security process that he first learned of the state tax liens, the other \naccounts placed for collection, and learned the judgment had not simply gone away. He \nlearned of all these unpaid obligations only after he had completed his e-QIP.  \n \nQuestion 27.d of the e-QIP is limited to \u201cunpaid\u201d judgments. It does not ask \nApplicant to list all judgment he has received during the seven year period occurring \nbefore the e-QIP, but to list only \u201cunpaid\u201d judgments. Applicant had no contact with the \ncreditor following the rejection of his offer on the repossessed vehicle. The creditor was \n\n \n10 \n \n \nnot actively seeking payment of this debt. Applicant had disputed this debt on his CBR \nand it no longer appeared on his CBR. These events caused Applicant to incorrectly \nbelieve the matter was closed and since he believed the matter was ended, he did not \nlist it when asked on his e-QIP about repossessions or unpaid judgments.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his questionnaire, he was unaware of the number and \nextent of his delinquent debts. If he was unaware of the judgment, tax liens, or the \nlength of delinquency on his debts, his incorrect answers were not deliberate \nfalsifications. Having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and listened to his testimony, I \nfind his answers were not deliberate omissions, concealments, or falsifications. I find for \nhim as to the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the SOR were \nnot incurred on luxuries, but were for a student loan, medical treatment, taxes, and a \nvehicle which was repossessed.  \n \nApplicant is paying on his tax liens and student loan. He paid 13 additional \naccounts. Having paid the majority of the SOR debts even though he has been out of \nwork for more than a year, coupled with his statement that he intends to pay the two \nremaining debts, I find he is likely to addresses these two remaining debts. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n\n \n11 \n \n \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required \nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1. r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted \n \n \n \n______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Duffy, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines E and F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 25, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 23, 2008. Applicant did not file\na response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in September 1999. He received\na discharge from the bankruptcy court in December 1999.\nForeclosure proceedings have been initiated by the holder of the first mortgage\non applicant\u2019s home.\nApplicant is indebted to NCB for a second mortgage on his home in the\napproximate amount of $47,000.00. This debt has been charged off.\nApplicant is indebted to HFC in the approximate amount of $6,755.00. This debt\nhas been charged off.\nApplicant is indebted to Arrow Ser on an account that was placed for collection\nby Washington Mutual/Providian in the approximate amount of $2,403.00. In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated this debt was \u201crecently paid off,\u201d but offered no\nproof.\nApplicant is indebted to Equidata on an account that was placed for collection by\nCox Cable in the approximate amount of $89.00. In his response to the SOR, applicant\nstated he \u201cpaid [this debt] via State of Virginia.\u201d\nApplicant is indebted to NCO Financial on an account that was placed for\ncollection by Dominion Virginia Power in the approximate amount of $249.00. In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated he \u201cpaid this debt,\u201d but offered no proof.\nApplicant is indebted to Progressive Insurance on an account that was placed for\ncollection in the approximate amount of $141.00.\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) in August 2007. In response to Question 28(b), applicant denied that he was\nthen over 90 days delinquent on any debts. In fact, he was more than 90 days\ndelinquent on both the first and second mortgages on his home. In his response to the\nSOR, applicant admitted he deliberately failed to disclose these delinquencies. He\nprovided no explanation for his dishonest conduct.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\n\n3\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\n\n4\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and it casts doubt on his current reliability and\njudgment. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated that his debts arose after a \u201cmotorcycle accident\nthat had [him] out of work for 3 months.\u201d Although this would constitute a factor beyond\nhis control, he provided no other details, such as the year of accident. Without more\ndetails, there is no way to determine if he acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nAccordingly, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. There is no evidence of counseling. And,\nthe problem is not being resolved and it is clearly not under control. Accordingly, this\nmitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d In his response\nto the SOR, applicant stated that he is \u201cgetting caught up on [his] finances and working\non hardship letter to save [his] house.\u201d However, he provided no proof that he has\nactually accomplished anything. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\nadmitted that he deliberately concealed his mortgage delinquencies from the\n\n5\nGovernment when he completed the e-QIP. This disqualifying condition is therefore\napplicable.\nI considered the potentially mitigating conditions under this Guideline and\nconclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of not\nmeeting his financial obligations and not being truthful with the Government about his\nfinancial delinquencies. He failed to offer any credible evidence that he is taking any\nmeaningful action to repay his delinquent debts. Under the circumstances, I have no\nchoice but to conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuidelines E and F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nGuideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On January 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\n\n\u201cDuring his testimony, Applicant claimed that this counselor had asked him if he had any problems and\n1\nApplicant replied \u2018no, I have not had any problems.\u2019  Applicant claimed that the counselor assumed Applicant meant\nthat he was not consuming any alcohol, although Applicant contended that he did not actually tell him that he was not\nconsuming alcohol, but he did not correct the counselor\u2019s misunderstanding . . . I do not find it credible that Applicant\nwas not specifically asked by the substance abuse counselor if he was still consuming alcohol, but even if Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation is true, Applicant knew he was leaving the counselor with an incorrect understanding of his alcohol\nconsumption history, and he knowingly did not correct it.\u201d  Decision at 3.  \n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 12, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nG and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated reply to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on May 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 15,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 22, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were\nalso received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nAugust 6, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.b, through 1.h., under\nGuideline G, and 2.a. through  2.c., under Guideline E with explanations. He denied\n1.a., and neither admitted nor denied 1.i., under Guideline G. The admitted allegations\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 42 years old. He is married, and he has two children. He served for\n20 years in the United States Navy, and he received an Honorable Discharge. He is\nemployed as a system administrator by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations that are\ncited in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant is alleged to have \u201cconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and to\nthe point of intoxication, from approximately 1978 to about October 2007.\u201d \nApplicant testified that he started consuming alcohol at age 12. His consumption\nincreased over time when he was under stress. In 2003 he was involved in motorcycle\naccident which greatly increased his stress and caused increased binge drinking (Tr at\n37-39). After he received treatment in April 2005, he abstained from consuming alcohol\ncompletely until December 2006. Since he began drinking alcohol again, his\nconsumption has varied; but he estimated that in 2007 and 2008, he consumed alcohol\non average once a month, in the quantity of three rum and cokes each time. \nApplicant conceded that he has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent on two\noccasions, and each time he was advised to abstain from any use of alcohol. He also\nhas been advised at the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings that he has attended, that he\nshould abstain from drinking alcohol. However, he testified that somebody in his\ncircumstances would eventually have a relapse and return to binge drinking if he\nabstained completely, so he continues to consume alcohol (Tr at 36-37,49). He\nindicated that he does have some \u201csafety implementations\u201d including never going out by\nhimself, always making sure that he has a method to get to his home, and not\nconsuming more than three drinks in one night or more than one drink in an hour (Tr at\n50). \n1.b. On August 31, 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving\nWhile Intoxicated (DWI). His license was suspended for one year.  This was as a result\nof a single vehicle accident in which Applicant was involved, and which resulted in him\nbeing hospitalized. \n\n3\n1.c. In 1998, Applicant was diagnosed as Alcohol Dependent when he received\ncounseling after a self-referral at an alcohol abuse center in Japan (Tr at 78).\n1.d. In February or March 2000, Applicant received substance abuse related\noutpatient treatment including group counseling sessions and required attendance at\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings. This occurred after Applicant became intoxicated\nduring one night and did not appear for duty the next day. At these sessions, Applicant\nwas advised to abstain completely from alcohol consumption, and Applicant testified\nthat he followed the abstention instructions until 2005 (Tr at 80-82).\n1.e. On February 17, 2005, Applicant was involved in an alcohol related incident.\nApplicant explained that he had consumed alcohol from approximately 6 p.m. until 5\na.m. the next day, during which he had consumed at least 12 alcoholic drinks. He\nthereafter appeared at his place of employment intoxicated (Tr at 44-45). \n1.f. On March 10, 2005, Applicant was involved in an additional alcohol related\nincident. Applicant testified that less than one month after the incident occurred,\ndescribed in 1.e., above, he was involved with a second almost identical incident (Tr at\n46). \n1.g. On March 10, 2005, While still in the Navy, Applicant was diagnosed as\nAlcohol Dependent by a medical doctor (Exhibit 4).\n1.h. On May 2, 2005, to May 30, 2005, Applicant received inpatient treatment at\na Naval Medical Center substance abuse rehabilitation program where he was also\ndiagnosed as Alcohol Dependent. The recommendations he received there included\nreceiving weekly counseling, attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, and\nabstaining completely from alcohol consumption. \n1.i. On November 20, 2008, Applicant underwent an alcoholic evaluation by a\nsubstance abuse counselor for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependence in full\nremission. On Exhibit 2,  interrogatories propounded to Applicant, there is a statement\nfrom a certified substance abuse counselor which states that Applicant \u201chas been\nabstinent since April 2005 without any problems.\u201d During his testimony, Applicant\nclaimed that this counselor had asked him if he had any problems and Applicant replied\n\u201cno, I have not had any problems.\u201d Applicant claimed that the counselor assumed\nApplicant meant that he was not consuming any alcohol, although Applicant contended\nthat he did not actually tell him that he was not consuming alcohol, but he did not\ncorrect the counselor\u2019s misunderstanding (Tr at 54).\nI do not find it credible that Applicant was not specifically asked by the substance\nabuse counselor if he was still consuming alcohol, but even if Applicant\u2019s explanation is\ntrue, Applicant knew he was leaving the counselor with an incorrect understanding of\nhis alcohol consumption history, and he knowingly did not correct it.  \n\n4\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government and exhibited\nquestionable judgement. \n2.a. In or about February 2004, while in the Navy, Applicant was charged with\nUnauthorized Absence and Failure to Obey an Order/Regulation. He was reduced in\nrank to an E5. Applicant testified that this event occurred because he left his duty\nstation to help a friend without authorization (Tr at 51).  \n       \n2.b. Applicant furnished interrogatory responses to the Government on August 1,\n2008 (Exhibit 3), in which he indicated that he last consumed alcohol in April 2005. In\nfact, as reviewed above, Applicant began consuming alcohol again in 2006, and has\ncontinued to consume alcohol continuously, at times on a one time a month basis, from\n2006 until the present. There is no reasonable explanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to\nidentify that he is still consuming alcohol. \n2.c. Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA)\non March 20, 2007 (Exhibit 1). He answered a series of questions under Section 23,\nregarding his police record. Question d asks \u201cHave you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant\u2019s deliberately failed to list his August 31, 2006 DWI\narrest, as set forth in 1.b., above. In his testimony, Applicant claimed that he did not\nrealize that he had been arrested since he was simply given a ticket at the hospital, and\nthen Applicant went to traffic court, where he had his license suspended. I  f i n d  t h a t\nApplicant knew or should have known that he was charged with an alcohol related\noffense, since he had to appear in court for his alcohol related accident, and this\nresulted in his driver\u2019s license being revoked for one year. \nMitigation\nIn an attempt to offer mitigating evidence, Applicant submitted a number of\ndocuments including his DD Form 214, which confirmed his long and successful career\nin the Navy and his Honorable Discharge separation (Exhibit A), nine Certificates of\nAppreciation and Merit (Exhibit B), eight extremely laudatory letters of recommendation\n(Exhibit C), and Applicant\u2019s 2008 Annual Appraisal which was consistently positive\n(Exhibit D).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government has established that Applicant's alcohol consumption has\nresulted in a series of alcohol related problems, including: one DWI conviction occurring\nin 1996, appearing at his employment site on at least two occasions while intoxicated in\n2005, receiving alcohol related treatment in 2000 and 2005, being diagnosed as alcohol\ndependant by at least two different experts, continuing to consume alcohol until the\npresent despite being advised by different experts that he should abstain completely,\n\n6\nand finally, supplying untruthful information about his alcohol consumption to a\nsubstance abuse counselor and to the Government.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 22. (a), (b), (c), and (e) apply to this case, because\nApplicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work and at work, binge\nalcohol consumption to the point of impaired judgement, and diagnosis by a duly\nqualified medical professional of alcohol dependence.   \nAs stated above, Applicant admitted to currently drinking, despite all the advice to\nthe contrary. I do not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies. Paragraph 1 is\nfound against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Government relies heavily on the honesty and\nintegrity of individuals seeking access to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual\nintentionally falsifies material facts or fails to furnish relevant information to a\nGovernment investigator, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless\npossesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. \nIn this case, I conclude that Applicant knowingly and wilfully furnished untruthful\ninformation to the Government regarding his alcohol usage in interrogatory responses to\nthe Government on August 1, 2008 (Exhibit 3), and in a sworn SCA on March 20, 2007\n(Exhibit 1). He also was untruthful to a substance abuse counselor that was evaluating\nhim for the Government.\nIn reviewing the DC under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16. (a) and (b) apply. I\ndo not find that any MC applies to this case.  Applicant has not mitigated this allegation.\nI resolve Guideline E against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines G and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply\nand the Mitigating Conditions do not, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He continued to maintain\nhis Nigerian passport after his naturalization, but surrendered it to his company\u2019s facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) when he became aware of the requirement to do so (G.E. 5). He\nobtained his U.S. passport in March 2000.\nIn June 1991, Applicant married a native-born U.S. citizen. They have three\nchildren, all born in the U.S. Applicant and his wife own three properties in the U.S. The\nhouse he lives in (for the last 13 years) is valued at $175,000.

They live in a small town in the Niger river delta. A third half-\nsister, a chemical engineer, lives in the U.S. and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. His 75-\nyear-old mother is a retired school teacher, whom Applicant has sponsored for\nimmigration to the U.S. (A.E. B, C). Applicant has twin sisters who are both\npharmacists. Another owns a boutique. The last sister is a doctor who is married to a\ndoctor. His half-brother attends a trade school. One half-sister is a cashier for a local\ncollege, the second is a pharmaceutical distributor. None of them has any connection to\nthe Nigerian government.\nApplicant has returned to Nigeria several times for vacation and family\nfunerals/memorials. He traveled there in 2001, 2002, 2005 (for his father\u2019s memorial\nservice), and twice in 2007 (once for a family funeral). He does not expect to return to\nNigeria unless his mother dies before she can immigrate to the U.S. As her only son, he\nis culturally obligated to hold her funeral. To that end, he has a Nigerian bank account\ncontaining $2,000.\nApplicant fully disclosed his foreign connections on his May 2007 and July 2007\nclearance applications (G.E. 1, 2) and fully discussed them during a December 2007\nsubject interview (G.E. 6). During his interview, he stated his willingness to renounce his\n\n3\nNigerian citizenship. When he became aware of the security concerns raised by his\npossession and use of a Nigerian passport, he surrendered his passport to his facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) in November 2008 (G.E. 5).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor\u2014who hired him\u2014extols his work performance and his\nhandling of classified and company sensitive information, and recommends him for his\nclearance (A.E.

Since independence, the government has experienced\nmultiple periods of political unrest, including military takeovers of the government.\nHowever, the military has generally ceded power back to civilian government, most\nrecently in May 1999. Although Nigeria has a poor human rights record, it has been a\nstaunch supporter of the U.S. global war on terrorism. Furthermore, since independence\nNigerian foreign policy has been characterized by a focus on Africa and adherence to\nseveral fundamental principles: African unity and independence; peaceful settlement of\ndisputes; nonalignment and nonintentional interference in the internal affairs of other\nnations; and regional economic cooperation and development. Nigeria is the largest\nU.S. trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, and the U.S. is second only to the United\nKingdom in trade with Nigeria. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria. Nigeria\nis not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic information. Nigeria is\nnot known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. The U.S. Department\nof State characterizes the foreign relations between the U.S. and Nigeria as excellent. \nNevertheless, violent crime, committed by ordinary criminals as well as by\npersons in police and military uniforms, can occur throughout the country. Kidnaping for\nransom of persons associated with the petroleum section, including U.S. citizens,\nremains common in the Niger Delta region. A travel warning issued in January 2007\nwarns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of further deterioration of the\nsecurity situation in the Niger Delta region. The travel warning also notes that al Qaida\nleadership has expressed an interest in overthrowing the Nigeria government.\nAlthough the civilian government since 1999 was characterized by political unrest\nand corruption, an opposition candidate was elected in May 2007 and power transferred\npeacefully. The new government has been working on necessary electoral and other\nreforms.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\n4\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does\nso, it establishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant\nmust then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a\nright to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n4\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.5\nIn this case, the argument for disqualification under Guideline B is not\npersuasive. Considering first the foreign country involved, Nigeria and the U.S. enjoy\n\n5\nexcellent foreign relations. However, while Nigeria focuses its foreign policy largely in\nthe region, it is actively cooperating with the U.S. in ending global terrorism. Nigeria is\nnot known to target protected U.S. information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to\nobtain protected information. Further, in this case it is not clear what further claim\nNigeria might have on Applicant. He has both expressed a willingness to renounce his\nNigerian citizenship, and has surrendered his passport to his FSO. The risk that Nigeria\nmight seek protected information from Applicant is low, if not non-existent.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s situation in relation to the Nigerian government, the\ngovernment produced no evidence that there was any risk, much less a heightened risk,\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of\nApplicant\u2019s family contacts in Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s travel to Nigeria has no independent\nsecurity significance given that Nigeria is not known to be targeting U.S. citizens for\ninformation. Further, the security significance of travel under most circumstances is\ndemonstrating an applicant\u2019s affection for family members, which his trips corroborate\nand which Applicant does not dispute. But none of his family members is connected to\nthe Nigerian government nor otherwise situated to be exploited for information\ngathering. There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in Nigeria, or in\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that he could be impelled to provide\nprotected information to Nigeria. \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are overwhelming. He has resided here for 29 years,\nand been a citizen for almost ten. His wife and children are U.S. born citizens. His\nfinancial interests in the U.S.\u2014nearly $600,000 in real estate, $40,000 in savings, and\n$102,000 annual salary\u2014dwarf the $2,000 in a Nigerian bank earmarked for his\nmother\u2019s funeral in the event she dies before he is able to bring her to the U.S. I resolve\nGuideline B for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

The\ncase was assigned to me on September 4, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 7, 2008.  A hearing was convened on October 7, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on October 15, 2008.  Based upon\nNovember 12, 2008\n\n2\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \n   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance\nquestionnaire of April 2007 by omitting his March 2001 arrest for alien smuggling when\nanswering question 23.  Under Guideline J, the alleged omission is incorporated by\nreference, and the underlying March 2001 arrest for alien smuggling in violation of 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1324 is also alleged.\n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted falsifying his security application\nand being arrested in March 2001 for alien smuggling.  In explanation, he claimed to not\nrecall being placed under arrest by the detaining officers.  He claimed the officers\nplaced him in a room for a long period of time, fingerprinted him, and then released him\nafter he signed some papers that he did not read before signing.  Applicant claimed.\nAlternatively, to miscalculating the dates of coverage in the questionnaire; even though\nhe was detained in March 2000, instead of 2001.  He claimed he did not recall being\nread his \u201cMiranda Rights,\u201d and was only 20 years at the time when he made a mistake\nin judgment.  Applicant did not address the details of the arrest in his answer.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 27-year-old-engineering technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is unmarried and has one child by his girlfriend, who lives with him\n(R.T., at 36).  Born and raised in the U.S., Applicant has for many years crossed the\nneighboring border to visit family members. Since 2000, he estimates to have crossed\nthe border three to four times a month on average to dine, and occasionally visit his\naunt (R.T., at 37-38).\nWhile visiting a border country with his cousin in March 2001, Applicant was\narrested by border agents and charged with alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1324 (a felony).  He had been asked by an unknown individual to drive his car across\nthe point of entry to the U.S. (R.T., at 32-33, 44-45, 5, 64).  This unknown individual\noffered him $300.00 to drive his car across the border (R.T., at 44-45).  Applicant\nacquiesced to he individual\u2019 request as a favor (R.T., at 65) and (accompanied by his\ncousin) drove the car to the U.S. point of entry (just short of the border) for the car\nowner without questioning him about his cargo or intentions or taking the $300.00 (R.T.,\nat 33, 45-46).  Federal custom officials declined to prosecute him for his role in the\noperation.  At the time of his arrest, Applicant was a lot attendant for a national home\nsupplier (see ex. 1).\n\n3\nWhen Applicant and his cousin reached the U.S. border, a border agent asked to\nopen the trunk of the vehicle Applicant was driving.  Applicant acquiesced in the agent\u2019s\nrequest.  When the agent opened the trunk, he found aliens inside (R.T., at 33, 46-47).\nThe agent grabbed the aliens from the trunk and escorted Applicant out of the vehicle\nand upstairs in the building. \nOnce inside the building, Applicant was seated and questioned.  He was then\nfingerprinted and asked to sign a piece of paper which the agent retained (R.T., at 34,\n48-53).  He was detained in the room until he was released on the U.S. side of the\nborder (R.T., at 51-52).  Because he was never read his Miranda Rights, he claims he\nwas never physically arrested (R.T., at 33).  Having never been arrested before, he did\nnot attach any significance to being fingerprinted (R.T., at 54-55).  Applicant never read\nthe paper he was given to sign before he signed it, and does not remember what he\nsigned (R.T., at 53-54).  He assures he did not attach any significance either to his\nbeing interviewed in the room for an extended period without being told he was free to\nleave (R.T., at 54-55).  FBI records confirm that Applicant was arrested in March 2001\nand charged with alien smuggling before being released (see ex. 2).\nJust what evidence the border agents developed regarding the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge of the alien cargo he was transporting when stopped and\nsearched is not clear from the administrative record.  The only evidence of his arrest\nand charge of knowing or reckless disregard that he was transporting undocumented\naliens is the FBI criminal information sheet and Applicant\u2019s testimony.  Applicant\u2019s denial\nof any pre-knowledge draws some reinforcement from his noted release after\nquestioning, and later declination to prosecute him for the charge.  Without more\nprobative evidence of his knowing or reckless disregard of the contents of the vehicle he\nwas asked to operate across the border, no inferences of criminal conduct can be\ndrawn with respect to this specific charge.\nAsked to complete a security clearance questionnaire (e-qip) in April 2007,\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23f, which asks him whether he had ever been\narrested within the last 7 years, or convicted of any offense (leaving out traffic-related\noffenses of less than $150.00).  In answering \u201cno\u201d to the question, Applicant omitted his\nMarch 2001 arrest.  He answered \u201cno,\u201d too, to question 23a (that addresses non-time\nsensitive felony offenses).  When he came to question 18 of the e-qip (questioning him\nabout his travel activities), he answered non-applicable (see ex. 1; R.T., at 42).\n Before answering the questionnaire, Applicant had two days to check with\nrelatives and law enforcement authorities about any questions he had trouble answering\n(R.T., at 71-72).  Still,  he never checked for federal arrests, only state arrests, claiming\nno understanding at the time of differences between state and federal authorities (R.T.,\nat 60-61).  \nApplicant attributed his omissions to three reasons: (1) He was never notified of\nany arrest resulting from 2001 detention and did not know he had any criminal record at\nthe state or federal level, (2) he mistakenly assumed his 2001 border arrest occurred in\n\n4\n2000, and was beyond the seven year period covered by the question (R.T., at 57-58,\n62-63), and (3) he later checked with his state\u2019s arrest records and found no record of\nan arrest.  Even though, he assigned three reasons for omitting his arrest, he assured\nhe would have listed his 2001 arrest if he was certain it was not more than seven years\nearlier (R.T., at 58-59).  However, he never articulated any reason why he would have\nlisted it anyway if he had correctly calculated the date of the arrest. His articulated no\nreasons either for not checking with federal authorities (claiming only that he did not\ndiscern a difference at the time).\nAfter he completed his e-qip, Applicant was twice interviewed by an OPM agent.\nIn his first interview, Applicant was asked by the investigator about his 2001 border\narrest (R.T., at 69-70).   When the investigator asked him whether he was familiar with\nthe arrest, he responded affirmatively.  In his second interview, he was queried about\nhis dual citizenship with the border country (R.T., at 70).  Applicant affirmed he was a\nU.S. citizen by birth and was not a dual citizen (R.T., at 34, 70). \nApplicant acknowledged that his mother has dual citizenship with this border\ncountry (see ex. 1; R.T., at 73), and he has a father who was born in this country and\nhas citizenship and possible residence there (ex. 1).  Besides his immediate family\nmembers, Applicant has an aunt and cousin who reside in this border country (R.T., at\n37-38).  Because Applicant did not list any of these relatives in his e-qip, their exact\nwhereabouts in the country is unclear.\nIn issue then, is whether inferences of knowing and wilful omission can be\nattributed to Applicant based on his acknowledged search by border agents, his lengthy\ndetention and interrogation, his fingerprinting, his affixing his signature on a piece of\npaper without reading it, and his confirmed arrest and alien smuggling charge in the\nFBI\u2019s criminal information sheet.  While in theory it is certainly plausible that a person\ncould be detained and fingerprinted based on a suspicious chain of events, and then\nreleased without an arrest, the likelihood of such an occurrence under the\ncircumstances described by Applicant seems remote.  Detention and fingerprinting by\nitself are key elements of an arrest.  So, too, his being asked to sign papers before he\nwas released in more consistent with some kind of citation or acknowledged arrest than\nwould be for any neutral acknowledgment of his detention, or even an authorized\nrelease of privacy material.\nFurther, Applicant himself hedged some on his reasons for omitting his 2001\narrest when he ascribed a second reason in his answer for his omitting his arrest.  He\nindicated, alternatively, that he miscalculated the dates and \u201cthought I was past the\nseven year mark when I submitted my security paper work on April 13 , 2007\" (see\nth\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR).  Such an attributed reason, even if framed alternatively,\nwas provided under oath and clearly acknowledges falsifying his security paper work,\nand admitting his awareness of the arrest when he completed his e-qip. Because this\nparticular arrest is covered by a felony statute, its listing was required in question 23a,\nregardless of the amount of time elapsed (see ex. 1). \n\n5\nWhen answering any allegations or questions under oath, an applicant is\nexpected to be fully truthful in his responses covering the question.  Applicant was\nnever able to successfully reconcile these highly divergent reasons for his arrest\nomission in his answer and hearing testimony.  \nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-qip omission of\nhis 2001 alien smuggling arrest (a serious felony under the governing statutory\nprovisions, if convicted), inferences warrant that his omission was made either\nknowingly, or in reckless disregard of the truth.  Applicant is of record in checking state\ncourts for evidence of arrests before completing his e-qip, but not federal sources at the\ntime.  Having family residing in this border country and regularly visiting these family\nmembers provided Applicant with at least some motivating reasons for wanting to keep\nhis family contacts and visits out of the investigatory process.  If his omission of his\n2001 arrest had not been detected, he might well have succeeded in maintaining an\neffective separation between his family members and the clearance application\ninvestigatory process.\nApplicant is well regarded by his employer.  His direct supervisor describes his\nwork performance as admirable and worthy of the promotion he received (see ex. A).\nHis supervisor credits Applicant with long work-days, travel to shore installation sites\nand solid team work.  He characterizes Applicant as a punctual employee who has\nearned the trust of every supervisor he has worked for (ex. A).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n6\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 18.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nAs the result of his transporting undocumented aliens across the U.S. border in\nMarch 2001, Applicant was stopped, searched, detained, and eventually arrested and\ncharged with alien smuggling in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71324.  While he was never\nprosecuted for the offense, the FBI\u2019s criminal information sheet confirms that Applicant\nwas clearly arrested and charged with the smuggling offense.  Security concerns are\n\n7\nraised over Applicant\u2019s omitting his arrest in the e-qip he completed in April 2007, and\nover the underlying conduct itself. \nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s omission of his March 2001 alien smuggling arrest (a felony).  DC \u00b6 16(a),\n\u201cthe deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s omissions.\n So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that\ndeviation tolerances for candor lapses are gauged very narrowly. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations were insufficient to avert inferences of knowing and wilful concealment of\nhis 2001 arrest. \nMitigation of Applicant\u2019s arrest/charge omission is difficult to credit Applicant with,\nsince he failed to promptly correct his omissions and misstatements until he was asked\nabout his arrest in his first OPM interview.   In the past, the Appeal Board has denied\napplicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC \u00b6 17(a) (the\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) where the applicant has waited many\nmonths to timely correct a known omission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal\nBd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995).  \nBy willfully and knowingly failing to disclose his 2001 alien smuggling arrest and\nfelony charge, Applicant concealed materially important background information needed\nfor the government to properly process and evaluate his security clearance application.\nHis probative reasons for his omitting his arrest/charge (lack of notice of an arrest and,\nalternatively, mistaken recall of th date of the arrest) are not sustainable grounds for\naverting inferences of falsification. Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his e-\nqip omission, and lack of any prompt, good faith correction, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the\nnecessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he knowingly and\ndeliberately withheld material background information about his alien smuggling\narrest/charge. \nCriminal conduct related to e-qip omission and underlying actions\nKnowing and wilful falsification is also covered by the criminal conduct guidelines.\nMitigation of the criminal features of his omissions falls along a little bit different fault line\nthan is the case with personal conduct considerations. To be sure, an applicant\u2019s youth\nat the time of the offense in issue and positive work record can play a major role in\nmitigating criminal conduct coverage of his omissions.  So while DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d has application to Applicant\u2019s e-qip\n\n8\nomission, MC \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement,\u201d has potential mitigation benefit as well.\nEmployment of the criminal conduct guideline and the use of separate whole-\nperson weighing of Applicant\u2019s actions and personal assessments of his work\ncontributions weigh in his favor. Applicant has no prior or subsequent criminal record,\nand his work contributions demonstrate considerable passage of time and maturity.\nApplicant\u2019s avoidance of any recurrent conduct in the last seven years and solid work\nrecord enable him to mitigate the potential criminal implications of his arrest omission. \nTo the extent, criminal conduct issues associated with Applicant\u2019s 2001 alien\nsmuggling arrest/charge retain any security concern, they are unsubstantiated.\nApplicant was never prosecuted on any alien smuggling charges, and his advance\nknowledge of the cargo of the vehicle he agreed to drive across the border for an\nunknown individual, while suspicious, and is no accompanied by any firm evidence of\nknowing or reckless smuggling of aliens across the border: proof conditions of 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1324. \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the 2(a) factors in Enclosure 2), unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph1.a of Guideline E. Favorable\nconclusions warrant, however, with respect to subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline\nE.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                   AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a \nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  Clearance is denied.\n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n                                        \n\n10\n  \n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: William Savarino, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of the Case\nOn June 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs), effective within the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 30, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on September 9, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 7, 2009. At the scheduled hearing, Applicant asked for a continuance to obtain\ncounsel. Applicant\u2019s hearing request was granted. The case was rescheduled for hearing\non December 8, 2009. \nJune 24, 2010\n\n2\nThe hearing was held as rescheduled. At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of four exhibits.  Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and nine exhibits.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on December 17, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nBesides its four exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of six\ndocuments pertaining to the country of Jordan: Background Note: Jordan, U.S.\nDepartment of State (February 2009); Country Specific Information: Jordan, U.S.\nDepartment of State (May 2009); 2008 Human Rights Report: Jordan, U.S. Department\nof State (February 2009); Country Reports on Terrorism 2008, Chapter 2-Country\nReports, Middle East and North African Overview (April 2009); Statement for the Record\nfrom the Counterintelligence Executive, Before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on\nImmigration, Border Security and Claims (September 2005; Annual Threat Assessment\nof Intelligence Community, Director of National Intelligence (February 2008).\nThe Government also sought administrative notice of ten documents relative to\nthe country of Israel: Background Note: Israel, U.S. Department of State (October 2007);\nCRS Report for Congress: Israel: Background and Relations with the United States,\nCongressional Research Service, Report RL 33476 (April 2009); Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage-2000, National\nCounterintelligence Center; Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\nand Industrial Espionage-2005, National Counterintelligence Center (August 2006);\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage-\n2007 (September 2008); National Counterintelligence Center; Intelligence Threat\nHandbook, June 2004, Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS); California Exporter\nSettles Criminal and Civil Charges for Illegal Exports of High Performance Oscilloscopes\nto Israel; U.S. Department of Commerce (April 2005); Minnesota Company Settles\nCharges Relating to Illegal Exports to Israel; U.S. Department of Commerce (April 2005);\nIsraeli Man Settles Charges of Concealing Material Facts, U.S. Department of\nCommerce (April 2002); Arizona Company Settles Charges of Illegal Exports of Lasers,\nU.S. Department of Commerce (May 2001).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nAdministrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well\nknown. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause\nshown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named background\nreports addressing the geopolitical situations in Jordan and Israel, respectively. \nAdministrative notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with\nthe provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing the current status of Jordan and Israel.  \n\n3\nProcedural Issues\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the\nallegations set forth in subparagraph 2.d for reasons that the alleged friend is his wife.\nThere being no objections, and good cause demonstrated, Department Counsel\u2019s\nwithdrawal motion was granted.  \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with his canceled U.S. 2003\npassport.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted ten days to supplement the\nrecord. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided a copy of his cancelled U.S.\npassport. Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, and\nfor good cause shown, the submission is admitted as exhibit J.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged in the SOR to have: (a) falsified his\nresume in 2001 to get a job with a state transportation department; (b) been re-assigned\nby his employer as a linguist in May 2005, while working in Qatar, because of allegations\nmade by his former fiancee, a foreign national, that he had revealed sensitive work\ninformation to her; (c) obtained a new U.S. passport, in approximately February 2006, by\nfalsifying material facts by stating his U.S. passport was stolen, and failing to truthfully\ndisclose his passport had been confiscated; and (d) been denied a contract linguist\nposition by the U.S. Army in January 2007 based on a finding that he presented a\nsecurity risk. \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged in the SOR to have: (a) a spouse who is a\ncitizen of Jordan residing in Israel; (b) a sister who is a citizen of Jordan, residing in\nQatar; (c) a friend, who is a citizen of Jordan, residing in Qatar; (d) a friend, who is a\ncitizen of Palestine, residing in Jordan; (e) a mother-in-law who is a citizen of Jordan,\nresiding in Israel; (f) three brother-in-laws and five sisters-in-law who are citizens of\nJordan, residing in Israel; (g) four aunts and an uncle of his wife, who are citizens of\nJordan, residing in Israel; (h) renewed his residency status or visa in Bahrain for\ncontinued employment in Qatar; (I) traveled to Jordan and Israel from December 2005 to\nFebruary 2006 to visit his sister and his wife; and (j) traveled to Israel in January 2007 to\nget married. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations. He denied\nfalsifying his resume revealing sensitive information to his former fiancee, and falsely\nclaiming his U.S. passport was stolen. He added no explanations.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year old linguist for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n4\nBackground\nApplicant was born and raised in Kuwait.  He immigrated to the United States\n(U.S.) from Jordan in 1979 on a student visa.  See Ex. 4. Applicant became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in February 1993.  See Exs. 1 and 4.  He maintains no dual citizenship and\nhas a degree in architectural design drafting.  Ex. 1.\nApplicant has been married four times. See Exs. 1 and 2.  He married W1, a U.S.\ncitizen, in 1985. According to the information provided an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) in June 2007, they divorced in 1991 over marital\ndifferences.  Ex. 2.  He has no children from this marriage. Applicant married again in\n1993 to W2.  He divorced her in Egypt in 1994 and has no children from this marriage.\nIn 1996, Applicant married W3. Ex. 2. They encountered irreconcilable differences\nand attempted a divorce in 2003.  When they learned that their attempts at divorce were\ninvalid, they arranged for formal divorce in September 2006.  Exs. 1 and 2.  Applicant\nattributes his divorce from W3 to family stress and logistical problems.  He blamed W3\nfor taking away his citizenship papers and his U.S. passport.  Ex. 2. They have no\nchildren from their marriage.\nApplicant married his current spouse (W4) in February 2007 after a two-year\nengagement. He met W4 in an internet exchange in July 2005 and twice visited her (in\nthe U.S. and Israel) before she came to live with him in March 2007 (following their\nmarriage).  See Exs. 1 and 2; Tr. 91, 119.  They have two children. Ex. 1; Tr. 92.  W4 is\na citizen of Jordan who works for the U.S. AID mission in Jerusalem, where she has\nresided since she and Applicant first met in 2005.  Exs. C, E, and F. She holds a\npermanent resident card that was issued to her by the Israeli government in October\n2009.  See Exs. 1, 2, 4, and D.\nApplicant\u2019s parents were born and raised in Palestine and are deceased. Ex. 1.\nHe has two sisters.  See Exs. 1 and 2; Tr. 123-24. Both are Jordanian citizens. One\nresides in Great Britain and has dual citizenship status with Great Britain and Jordan.\nSee Exs. 1 and 2. The other resides in Jordan. Neither of his sisters have any\nassociations with any government or military organization. Tr. 97, 106-07. Applicant also\nhas a close friend who is a citizen of Jordan residing in Qatar.  See Ex. 4. \nW4's mother is a citizen of Jordan who resides in Israel with W4.  Tr. 96-97.  W4\nhas three brothers and five sisters who are citizens of Jordan and reside in Israel.  See\nExs. 1 through 3; Tr. 99-100.  None of W4's brothers and sisters, or their spouses, have\nany associations with any government or military organization.  Tr. 101-02 .  W4 also has\nfour aunts and an uncle who are citizens of Jordan residing in Israel.  See Exs. 1 and 2;\nTr. 103-04.  \n\n5\nApplicant communicates with W4 regularly and maintains monthly contact with his\nsisters.  Occasionally, he communicates with his wife\u2019s siblings.  See Exs. 2 and 4; Tr.\n112-13.  He has infrequent contact with the rest of his wife\u2019s family members and his\nfriend. Ex. 2; Tr. 113-15.  Between December 2005 and February 2006, he traveled to\nJordan and Israel to see his sister and W4.  He returned to Israel in January 2007 to\nmarry W4.  None of W4's family members have ever visited Applicant in the U.S.  Tr.\n123.\nSince January 2007, Applicant has not traveled to Jordan,  Israel, or any country\nin the Middle East, for any reason.  Applicant has no reason to believe that any of his\nfamily members residing in Jordan or Israel are at any risk to pressure, compromise, or\ncoercion.   See Exs 2 and 4.\nApplicant\u2019s work experience\nBefore Applicant accepted his present linguist assignment, he held linguist\npositions with several contractors. Between May 2001 and January 2002, he was\nemployed by a large state transportation agency as an engineer. In his employment\napplication with the agency, he claimed to have a basic knowledge of and familiarity with\nMicrosoft hardware (including excel programs) and excellent work experience. See Ex.\n2; Tr. 49-52, 133-35. Based on his assurances, he was hired as a transportation\nengineer with the state agency.  Exs. 1 and 2.  Shortly after his hire, and during his\nprobation period, he encountered difficulties in excel work on his assigned computer.\nAsked by his supervisors why he claimed excel training and experience, Applicant\nresponded that he did not know he put in for a higher grade position and believed he\nwould get some excel training. Ex. 2. Applicant acknowledged that his supervisor did not\naccept his explanation, and accused him of lying. Tr. 56-57. As a result of this encounter,\nApplicant\u2019s state employer issued a notice of rejection to him. See Exs.  4 and B; Tr. 58-\n59.   Rather than challenge his rejection, he resigned his position.  Tr. 59-60, 202.\nApplicant was unemployed for most of the two years spanning January 2002 and\nFebruary 2004.  Ex. 1.  Between February 2004 and May 2005, he worked as a linguist\nfor a language consultant with the U.S. Embassy in Qatar See Exs. 1 and 2; Tr. 148.  In\nMay 2005, he was re-assigned by his employer due to an argument with his supervisor\nand allegations made by his former fiancee (previously disclosed to employer), a foreign\nnational, that he had divulged sensitive information to her.  See Exs. 2 and I; Tr. 150-51.\nWhile Applicant retreated some from his earlier explanations of his reassignment when\npressed for reasons at hearing, his initial explanations offer the most plausible reasons\nfor his re-assignment and ultimate departure from the language consulting firm he\nworked for and are accepted.  What disclosures his fiancee might have made to U.S.\nEmbassy officials to prompt his re-assignment is not known, but were apparently serious\nenough to warrant corrective action by his employer, Applicant\u2019s denials notwithstanding.\nTr. 65-66.\nFollowing his re-assignment and departure from his linguist position in Qatar,\nApplicant could not find suitable employment. Over the course of the year (between May\n\n6\n2005 and April 2006), he was unemployed for the most part.  During his extended period\nof unemployment, he received $1,000 a month in unemployment benefits.  See Ex. 4.\nIn April 2006, Applicant returned to the same state transportation agency he\nworked for in 2001.  In his telephone interview with an agency head, he failed to disclose\nhis prior employment with the agency and the circumstances in which he reassigned. Tr.\n69-70.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor claimed he lied to him and issued a notice of rejection in\nJuly 2006.  See Exs. 2 and B; Tr. 68-69. The agency proceeded to separate him from\nservice.  Tr. 70-72. \nClaiming he listed his prior employment with the agency in his employment\napplication, Applicant challenged his latest rejection and reached a settlement with the\nstate agency in October 2007.  See Ex. B; Tr. 66-67, 71-72.  By the terms of his\nsettlement, Applicant was placed on unpaid leave of absence from July 2006 through\nJune 2007.  The agency, in turn, agreed to assign 11 days of paid administrative time for\neach monthly pay period between July 2007 and June 2010.  See Ex. B.  For his part,\nApplicant agreed in advance to resign from the state agency, effective June 2010,\nwithdraw all appeals, and to avoid any future application or acceptance of employment\nfrom the state agency in the future.  Ex. B.\nApplicant interviewed for a contract linguist position with the U.S. Army in January\n2007.  See Ex. 4.  During his interview, he changed his answers numerous times and,\naccording to the Army\u2019s investigation record, lied several times during the interview.\nFollowing the interview, the Army noted the absence of any national agency check and\nan incomplete national criminal information center check and found Applicant to present\ncounterintelligence and foreign preference risks.  Ex. 4.  Based on its findings, the Army\nconcluded that Applicant should not be considered for a position of trust with the U.S.\nGovernment.  See Ex. 4.  \nPassport issues\nApplicant was issued a U.S. passport when he became a naturalized citizen in\n1993.  This passport expired in February 2003 and bears two cancellation stamps: one in\nJanuary 2003 and another on March 12, 2003.  See Ex. G.  Circumstances surrounding\nthese dual cancellation dates are not clear.  The first one cites a new application, which\nwould appear to corroborate Applicant\u2019s claims that he obtained a new passport to\nreplace his initial one that was scheduled to expire in February 2003. See Exs. 4 and G.\nIn late March 2003, Applicant became embroiled in a heated argument with W3\nover his planned deployment to the Middle East.  See Ex. A.  He reported in a March 5,\n2003 police report that W3 took his items of identification (i.e., his passport, his driver\u2019s\nlicense, and his social security card).  Ex. A.  Whether she took his old canceled passport\nor his newly issued one is not clear. Applicant did not provide any documented\nexplanations in his Army interview and hearing of whether the taken passport was his\ncancelled one or a freshly issued passport.  Nor did he provide any details of when he\nobtained a new one.  Piecing together the March 12, 2003 date stamp on his old passport\n\n7\nand his very limited accounts in his Army and OPM interviews, inferences may be\nreasonably drawn that he applied for and obtained a third passport in March 2003.\nCompare Exs. 2 and 4 with G.  \nShortly after obtaining his third U.S. passport in March 2003, Applicant claimed he\nrecovered the passport his fiancee had previously taken from him.  Tr. 75-77, 82.  He\nrecollected that he returned to the Post Office to obtain a cancellation of his recovered\npassport.  By all reasonable accounts, Applicant kept both his old Jordanian passport and\nhis canceled U.S. passport. He provided no meaningful explanations as to why he\ndetermined to retain possession of them.\nOn June 9, 2005,  Applicant reported to the local police in another state that his old\nJordanian passport and his U.S. passport had been stolen from his briefcase (along with\nhis deployment papers) during his short stay at a local motel in the evening of June 3,\n2005.  See Ex. 3.  In a follow-up June 14, 2005 police report, he told police that he still\nretained his current U.S. passport.  Ex. 3.  Police returned the following day to take a third\naccount from Applicant about his stolen passports.  In this revised account, he confirmed\nthat his two old passports were never found.  Ex. 3. Then, in a fourth and final revised\naccount of his passport theft on June 27, 2005, he advised investigating police that he\nfound both expired passports. However, he did not provide any details of how he found\nhis two old passports.  \nWhen asked what he did with his recovered Jordanian and U.S. passports,\nApplicant responded that he shredded his Jordanian passport and returned it to the\nJordanian Embassy, without providing any documentation of his actions.  By contrast, he\nassured that he retained his canceled U.S. passport.  Tr. 161.  Applicant provided no\nfurther details of why he retained his canceled U.S. passport. Tr. 159-61. \nBetween December 2005 and February 2006, Applicant traveled to Jordan and\nIsrael to visit his sister and W4 (his girlfriend at the time).  He used his recovered current\npassport from March 2003 to enter and exit the countries. Tr. 80-81. When departing\nIsrael in February 2006, he was detained by Israel airport personnel and questioned\nabout the expired U.S. passport he possessed.  Ex. 4; Tr. 120, 190.  By the time of his\ndeparture from Israel, his U.S. passport had expired.  When he arrived back in the U.S.,\nhe was detained again by airport personnel.  He told the Army interviewer that his expired\nU.S. passport was confiscated by airport personnel. See Ex. 4. His story changed some,\nhowever, when he was asked about the passport at hearing.  At hearing, he assured his\npassport was marked canceled and returned to hm.  Tr. 81. He documented his claims\nafter the hearing with a copy of his canceled U.S. passport that bears a February 24,\n2006 cancellation date.  See Ex. J.  \nShortly after he returned from Israel in February 2006, Applicant applied for a new\nU.S. passport from a local post office. Tr. 83-84. To obtain a new passport, he falsely told\npost office personnel that his U.S. passport had been stolen.  See Ex. 4; Tr. 84. What he\ndid not tell responsible post office personnel was that his U.S. passport had earlier been\nconfiscated by airport personnel and canceled at the airport. See Exs. 4 and J. Applicant\n\n8\nprovided no convincing explanations to avoid drawn inferences that he misstated the\ncircumstances about his loss of his U.S. passport when he applied for a new passport. Tr.\n84-86. He essentially misled post office personnel to ensure his application for a new\npassport would be expeditiously approved. This drawn inference is fully supported by the\naccounts contained in the Army\u2019s investigation file and Applicant\u2019s own testimony.\nJordan\u2019s country status\nJordan occupies a small land area in the Middle East that once was part of the\nhistorical Fertile crescent region. See Background Note: Jordan, supra, at 2. Jordan has a\nconstitutional monarchy based on its constitution promulgated in January 1952.  Id., at 3.\nIt is a quite small country with limited natural resources, especially its water supplies. Its\neconomy is a developing one that relies heavily on imported oil supplies. See\nAdministrative Notice: Jordan, at 1-2. Jordan is ruled by King Abdullah II, and has a\ncouncil of ministers who are selected by the King.  See Background Note: Jordan, supra,\nat 1-4. Jordan also has a partially elected bicameral National Assembly. Id., at 3-4.  \nFrom 1949 to 1967, Jordan administered a territory known as the West Bank.  See\nBackground Note: Jordan, supra, at 2.  Since the 1967 war, when Israel assumed control\nof the territory, the U.S. has considered the West Bank to be territory occupied by Israel.\nId., at 2.  The U.S. continues to believe that the final status of the West Bank can be\ndetermined only through negotiations among the concerned parties based on United\nNations (UN) Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.  Id.\nFor over sixty years, Jordan has maintained a close alliance relationship with the\nU.S. However, it has had something of a turbulent history since it signed a mutual\ndefense pact in May 1967 with Egypt.  Background Note: Jordan, supra, at 1-4.  \nDespite some noticeable improvements in certain areas, Jordan\u2019s human rights\nrecord continues to be problematic. See 2008 Human Rights Report: Jordan, supra, at 1-\n2. Problems include torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, overcrowded prisons\nwith poor sanitary conditions, denial of due process, infringement on citizen\u2019s privacy\nrights, political detainees, and restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly,\nassociation, and movement. Id.  The UN reports widespread use of torture by police and\nsecurity forces in the country, and there has been some substantiation of torture reports.\nSee 2008 Human Rights Report: Jordan, supra, at 2. \nJordanian law allows any male relative to prevent a woman or child from leaving\nJordan, even if they are U.S. citizens.  See Country Specific Information: Jordan, supra,\nat 3.  Jordanian law applies to dual Jordanian-U.S. citizens, and subjects dual citizens to\nmandatory military service obligations for males under the age of 37.  Id. Jordan treats\ndual citizens as Jordanian citizens and is known not to inform U.S. embassy personnel\nwhen a dual Jordanian-U.S. citizen encounters a problem.  Id. \nNotwithstanding Jordan\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists, drafting of counter-\nterrorism legislation, prosecution of terrorism cases, including both al-Qaida and non-al-\n\n9\nQaida defendants, and investigation and disruption of terrorist plots, the threat of\nterrorism remains high in Jordan.  Terrorists in Jordan often do not distinguish between\nU.S. government personnel and private citizens and specifically target areas known to be\nfrequented by Westerners.  See Country Specific Information: Jordan, supra, at 2.\nTo be sure, Jordanian security forces are of record in disrupting numerous terrorist\nplots against U.S. interests in recent years, and have continued to prosecute terrorism\ncases, both al-Qaida related and non-al-Qaida related. See Country Reports on Terrorism\n2008, supra, at 12. Jordan\u2019s state security court convicted and sentenced three\nindividuals, first to death, but then commuted the sentences to 15 years each, for plotting\nto assassinate President Bush during his November 2006 trip to Jordan. Id.  For the\nfuture, terrorist groups can be expected to continue to conduct intelligence activities as\neffectively as the Jordanian state\u2019s intelligence services. See Statement for the Record\nfrom the Counterintelligence Executive, supra, at 2.  \nIsrael\u2019s country status\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government\nand exercises executive power.  See Administrative Notice: Israel, supra, at 1-2.  Israel\nhas a diversified, technologically advanced economy that is growing at about 5 per cent\nper year.  See Background Note: Israel, supra, at 6-9.  The U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading\npartner. Israel\u2019s major industrial sectors include high-technology electronic and\nbiomedical equipment, chemicals, and transport equipment.  Id. at 8.  \nIsraeli-U.S. country relations remain strong and close: They share common\ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. See CRS Report for\nCongress: Israel: Background and Relations with the United States, Congressional\nResearch Service, supra.  The U.S. is committed to Israel\u2019s security and well being since\n1948 and provides important economic and security assistance to the country. Arab-\nIsraeli peace initiatives have been a major focus of the U.S.-Israeli geopolitical\nrelationship for over five decades.  See Background Note: Israel, supra, at 11.  U.S.\nefforts to achieve a Middle East peace settlement are based on UN Security Council\nResolutions 242 and 338, which \u201chave been based on the premise that as Israel takes\ncalculated risks for peace the United States will help minimize those risks.\u201d Id.\nTrue, issues remain between the two countries. For instance, the U.S. is\nconcerned with Israeli military sales, inadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual\nproperty, and espionage-related cases. See id., Summary section and 31 through 34.\nThe U.S. and Israel have regularly discussed Israel\u2019s sale of sensitive equipment and\ntechnology to various countries, especially China (the PRC). Israel reportedly is the\nPRC\u2019s second major arms supplier, after Russia.  Id. at 33.\nU.S. concerns also extend to Israel\u2019s very active data collection activities.  The\nNational Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage lists Israel as one of the most active collectors of\n\n10\nproprietary information.  See Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\nand Industrial Espionage-2005, supra. The most recent report identifies the major\ncollectors as repeat offenders who have targeted multiple U.S. government organizations\nsince at least 1997.  See id. at 2.\nCases have been reported involving Israeli individuals exporting, or attempting to\nexport, U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel, including: (1) oscilloscopes that are\nexport-controlled \u201cfor nuclear non-proliferation and anti-terrorism reasons,\u201d (see California\nExporter Settles Criminal and Civil Charges for Illegal Exports of High Performance\nOscilloscopes to Israel, supra); (2) epitaxial wafers and oscillator chips that could be used\nin communications and radar systems (see  Minnesota Company Settles Charges\nRelating to Illegal Exports to Israel, supra); (3) an infrared camera, the export of which is\ncontrolled \u201cfor national security reasons because of its potential application in military\nsurveillance\u201d (see Israeli Man Settles Charges of Concealing Material Facts, supra); and\n(4) diode lasers that have \u201cpotential military applications, and are controlled for national\nsecurity and nuclear non-proliferation reasons\u201d (see Arizona Company Settles Charges of\nIllegal Exports of Lasers, supra). Foreign government entities, including intelligence\norganizations and security services, have capitalized on private-sector acquisitions of\nU.S. technology.  See Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage-2005, supra, at 5-6.  \nWork-related omissions\nIn his first application for an engineering position with a state transportation agency\nin 2001, Applicant inflated his training and experience in computer technology to obtain\nhis engineering position.  When asked about his work-related inflation of his work training\nand experience by the Army interviewer in January 2007, Applicant informed the\ninterviewer that he was familiar with Microsoft excel, when in fact he was not.  See Ex. 4.\nHis claimed confusion about the words he used to describe his computer training and\nexperience were not convincing to his supervisor who threatened to terminate him and\npermitted him to resign his position under unfavorable circumstances.  Applicant declined\nto acknowledge the circumstances of his resignation from the state transportation agency\nwhen asked about his employment record in the July 2006 e-QIP he completed in July\n2006. See Ex. 1; Tr. 203-04.  And he provided false and inconsistent answers about his\nforced resignation when initially interviewed by the Army investigator in January 2007.\nSee Ex. 4; Tr. 195-97.  \nOnly when pressed by the Army investigator did he admit to \u201clying\u201d twice on his job\napplications for employment with the state agency . Ex. 4.  When interviewed by an OPM\ninvestigator several months later, he returned to his initial practice of defending the\ngeneral accuracy of the training and experience he claimed in his job application with the\nstate agency. \nWhen Applicant reapplied for an engineering position with the same state\ntransportation agency in April 2006, he failed to inform the agency who hired him that he\n\n11\nhad resigned his position with the agency four years earlier to avoid facing possible\ntermination. See Exs. 2 and 4.  Applicant\u2019s notifying his supervisor of his omission several\nweeks later did not excuse the omission and ultimately resulted in his supervisor\u2019s\nrelieving him of his probation duties. His ensuing settlement only partially restored his\nexpected benefits with the state agency.  See Ex. B; Tr. 205-17.  \nEndorsements\nApplicant did not provide any endorsements from friends and associates, or fitness\nevaluations to counter the trust lapses exhibited in his various employment accounts.  Nor\ndid he provide any proof of community and civic contributions.  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making process\ncovering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could create a\npotential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations that\ncould affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered before\ndeciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied.\nAlthough, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the AGs, which\nare intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense decision\nbased upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context of the\nwhole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n\n12\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism   See AG \u00b6 6.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\n\n13\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a linguist for a defense contractor with work-related personal\nconduct issues, as well as foreign influence issues associated with his having family\nmembers who reside in Israel and Jordan.  Although his contacts with most of his\nfamily members residing in both countries are not frequent, they do involve his spouse\nand his siblings, as well as immediate members of his wife\u2019s family. Both countries\nhave strong democratic foundations and enjoy good political and economic relations\nwith the U.S. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nJudgment and trustworthiness concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\npattern of judgment, trust and candor lapses associated with his misrepresentations\nabout his training and experience in employment applications he completed for a state\ntransportation agency. Concerns are also raised about the circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s being re-assigned by his employer in Qatar, the misstatements and\ninconsistencies imputed to him in his various accounts covering his experiences with\nhis passports, and the lack of candor he exhibited in his 2007 Army interview and\nensuing  denial of consideration for a position of trust as an Army translator. These\nactions reflect serious trust breaches, candor lapses, and disregard of the DoD\u2019s rules\nand policies for clearance holders.\nApplicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by Guideline E, and are entitled to\ncognizance under this Guideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No.\n06-20964, at 6 (App. Bd. April 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is  probative adverse\ninformation covered by Guideline E which reflects a recurring pattern of questionable\njudgment use, trust breaches, or candor lapses, grounds exist for considering the\nallegations covered by Guideline E.\nUnder Guideline E, two disqualifying conditions are specifically applicable to\nApplicant\u2019s situation, given the number of judgment and trust lapses he displayed in\n\n14\nhis job applications with the state agency and in his reported divulgence of sensitive\ninformation to his US Embassy employer while operating in Qatar.  Both D.C. \u00b6 16(d),\n\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline\nand may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when\ncombined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d and DC \u00b6 16(f), \u201cviolation of a\nwritten or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer as a condition\nof employment,\u201d have some application to the facts of the case. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s explanations for his passport losses and cancellations\nreconcilable with one another, but not all of them.  Both from a piecemeal and overall\nperspective, this is a very difficult case to unravel. Questions persist about his\nhandling of his passport issues that arose over a five-year period between 2003 and\n2007.  In the same vein, questions continue to plague Applicant over the\ncircumstances of his re-assignment from his Qatar translator position in 2005, and his\ninflating of his work-skills and experience in his applications for an engineering\nposition with a state transportation agency in 2001, and again in 2005.  While\nApplicant\u2019s settlement of his claims against the state transportation agency that issued\nhim a rejection notice for his second tour of duty in 2006 partially absolves him of the\nadverse implications of his rejection, his settlement by itself does not absolve him of\nthe adverse trust implications from his employment omissions of his prior employment\nwith the agency.  And his 2006 settlement does not  address his 2002 separation for\ninflating his resume with training and experience he did not possess at the time of his\nhire.  \nBased on the passport explanations that Applicant was able to establish with\nhis evidence  (i.e., his passport cancellations and new issuances and his settlement of\nhis 2005-2006 employment tour), Applicant is entitled to take some advantage of MC\n\u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d and MC \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\nor duress,\u201d of the mitigating conditions in the personal conduct guideline.  \nFor the most part,  Applicant\u2019s actions leave too many unresolved questions\nabout his ability to provide consistent, truthful explanations when asked by public\nofficials in prospective trust relationships or retain sensitive information when\nemployed as a linguist for a government contractor (the Qatar situation).  To be sure,\nApplicant was open about his various employment relationships when interviewed by\nArmy and OPM investigators.   But the employment relationships he either assumed\nor applied for (as with the Army) are replete with inconsistent and false information.\nBoth his OPM and Army interview summaries reflect numerous inconsistences and\n\n15\nmis-characterizations of the status of his U.S. passport, as well as misstatements\nabout his work training and experience in the two job applications he filed with the\nstate transportation agency he briefly worked for on two occasions. The circumstances\nof his forced resignation from his linguist assignment in Qatar leave many questions\nunresolved as well.  Besides an argument he had with supervisor, he suggested his\nforced resignation might have been due to his fiancee\u2019s telling his employer that he\ndivulged sensitive information to her. Divulgence of sensitive information, if true, could\ncertainly have raised major questions about his fitness to hold a security clearance\nand a sensitive translator position. Applicant denied any divulgence of sensitive\ninformation when confronted at the hearing., but he acknowledged the possibility of his\nfiancee\u2019s reporting him, when he spoke to Army investigators.  Documentation of the\nreasons for his re-assignment would be helpful to resolving the issue, but is lacking.\nSo, questions persist about whether divulged sensitive information to his fiancee, and\nwhat that information might be. \nWhen evaluated collectively, and not in a piecemeal fashion, Applicant\u2019s\nmultiple inconsistencies and misstatements leave too many open questions about his\nintegrity and honesty to meet the high standards of trust and reliability imposed on\npersons who are granted access  to see classified information. \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).\nFailure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to provide consistently complete and\naccurate answers to investigators seeking background information on his job and\nclearance suitability do raise security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his repeated failure to provide full and truthful answers about his\npassport status and employment relationships. Cultural and language differences,\nwhile perhaps contributory to his judgment and trust lapses, do not account for the\nmanifest gaps and inconsistences in his documented accounts to investigators seeking\nbackground information from him. Too many of his accounts reflect either false\naccounts or irreconcilable ones furnished to various agencies over an extended period\n(viz. between 2001 and 2007).  Either way, Applicant\u2019s accounts do not contain full and\naccurate summaries of information provided investigators, employers, and postal\npersonnel asked to replace a \u201cstolen\u201d passport. While unemployment might have\nplayed a considerable role in Applicant\u2019s disposition for avoiding information that would\njeopardize his employment prospects, it is not enough to mitigate security concerns.\n\n16\n Endorsements and performance evaluations might have been helpful, too, in\nmaking a whole-person assessment of his overall clearance eligibility, but were not\nprovided. Overall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant based on the limited\namount of information available for consideration in this record does not enable him to\nestablish judgment and trust levels sufficient to overcome security concerns arising out\nof his trust and candor lapses associated with his past employment affiliations and\npassport experiences.  \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s interview history of providing inconsistent and\ninaccurate background information to both government investigators and federal/state\nemployers, his checkered employment history to date that entails either rejections or\nre-assignments, and his passport accounts that are not fully reconcilable, it is still too\nsoon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s overall trustworthiness and\nreliability.  More time is needed to make judgment and trust assessments of Applicant\nthat are commensurate with the minimum requirements for holding a security\nclearance.\nForeign influence concerns\nThe Government raises security concerns over risks associated with Applicant\u2019s\nwife,  siblings, his wife\u2019s family, and a listed friend  who are citizens of Jordan residing\nin Jordan, Israel, and Qatar, respectively. Key to the Government\u2019s foreign influence\nconcerns are Applicant\u2019s immediate family and wife\u2019s family members who currently\nreside in Jordan and Israel.  \nDespite strong country relations and reciprocal efforts in prosecuting the war on\nterror, the threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan.  Terrorists are known to target\nboth U.S. government personnel and private citizens in areas known to be frequented\nby Westerners.  Jordan, a country that is controlled by a constitutional monarchy, still\nhas a poor human rights record.  It remains a country in transition and in the process of\nestablishing stable political and economic institutions. The historically close relationship\nbetween Applicant and his immediate and extended family members (who reside in\nIsrael and Jordan) makes them potentially vulnerable to coercion and non-coercive\nmeasures.  Similar concerns about terrorists involve Applicant and his family members\nwho reside in Israel.  \nBecause insurgents operating in Jordan and Israel are known to violate\ndomestic laws and regulations, as well as international laws, they are more likely to use\nimproper and illegal means  to obtain classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or\ncontrol through his family members still residing in these two countries. DC \u00b6 7(a),\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion,\u201d applies.  \n\n17\nTo date, none of Applicant\u2019s siblings, wife, or in-laws or parents or siblings\nresiding in Jordan and Israel, respectively, have any history of being subjected to any\ncoercion or influence. These historical antecedents do limit the severity of any potential\nconflict situation. However, the absence of any past coercive measures taken by\nJordan and Israel authorities does not completely absolve Applicant from coercive risks\nin the future given Jordan\u2019s geographical location and presence of terrorists operating\nwithin its borders, and Israel\u2019s active data collection program and numerous case\nprosecutions of individuals involved in export violations.  For these reasons, \u00b6 DC 7(b),\n\u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nStill, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate and extended family members have any\nidentified prior affiliations or connections with any foreign governments (Jordan and\nIsrael included).  None have any known affiliations with either the Jordanian or Israeli\ngovernments, or any other foreign government (to include Qatar).  Any potential conflict\nthat might be associated with his sisters, his wife, and his wife\u2019s family is small and not\nlikely to pose any conflicts of interest for Applicant in the foreseeable future. \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign\ncountry may not be in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical\nnecessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing\nin the supplied materials and country information about Jordan and Israel.  Unlike the\nold AGs, the new ones do take into account of the country\u2019s demonstrated relations\nwith the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives\nwith citizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The\ngeopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nApplicant\u2019s situation is a special one for reasons that pertain wholly to his unique\nstatus and circumstances. Not only has he been careful to avoid any frequent contact\nwith his sisters and his wife\u2019s family members in Jordan and Israel, but none of his\nfamily members have any known history of being pressured or coerced to elicit\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession. In special circumstances involving\nlinguists who put themselves in harm\u2019s way by working in unstable countries where\nthey have family members residing, the Appeal Board has been quick to note that such\nindividuals are more likely to recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign\npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. By their training\nand work descriptions, they are expected to have experience working in dangerous\nplaces. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). Applicant\u2019s lengthy\nhistorical  connections to the U.S. since his naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 1993 and\nhis wife\u2019s established work relationship with the U.S. Government in Israel make it\nunlikely he would ever resolve any potential conflict against his U.S. interests.  \n\n18\nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.,\u201d  is available to Applicant. Neither Applicant nor his immediate or extended family\nresiding in Israel and Jordan pose any specific heightened security risks that could\nsubject them to potential pressures and influence from either Israeli or Jordanian\ngovernment and military officials.  Of benefit to Applicant, too, is MC \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has some\napplicability, too, based on Applicant\u2019s infrequent contacts with his siblings and his\nwife\u2019s family members  residing in Israel and Jordan.   \n \nOne other mitigating condition has application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC \u00b6\n8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests\nis such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to\ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d is fully applicable. His financial\ninterests in Israel and Jordan are minimal (and for the most part through his wife who\nresides in Israel), and are not likely to create any problem conflicts in the foreseeable\nfuture.    \nTo complete a  whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks\nto ascertain whether they are fully compatible with minimum security clearance\neligibility requirements, Applicant\u2019s civilian contributions to U.S. security interests as an\nArab linguist require careful balancing with the raised security concerns. On the one\nhand, he has exhibited trust and candor lapses in his work-relationships, and has no\ncompiled record of endorsements and positive performance evaluations to assess his\noverall trust and reliability. There is some evidence, too, of his possibly divulging\nsensitive information to his third spouse that affected his employment status in Qatar in\n2005. What kind of information Applicant might have divulged is undeveloped in the\nrecord and is not enough to create any reasonable doubts about his ability to resist any\nmounted pressure or compromise attempts against any of his relatives residing in\nJordan or Israel.  \nOverall, though, there is nothing probative in any of the backgrounds of\nApplicant and his family members residing in Israel and Jordan to suggest that any of\nthem are at serious risk to compromise classified information when confronted with a\npressure situation.  Most of them reside with W4 in Israel, where W4 is employed by\nthe U.S. AID, and Applicant has very little contact with any relatives outside of his wife\nand his sisters.\nWhole-person assessment is available herein to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure\nto conflicts of interests with his Israeli and Jordanian family members.  Most\n\n19\nimportantly, Applicant is not aware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that\nany of his family members might be exposed to.  So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the potential\nrisk of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought to bear on him, or any of his\nrespective family members (whether or not they reside in the U.S., Israel, or Jordan) is\nminimal and mitigated. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(a).\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.d :\nAgainst Applicant \nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 2.a through 2c:  \n          For Applicant\n           Subpara. 2.d withdrawn:\n          For Applicant\nSubparas 2.e through 2.j:                       For Applicant\n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant continued to consume alcohol despite alcohol-related treatment (SOR 1.a); that she received alcohol-related treatment in 1997, 2001, 2003, January 2006, and from December 19, 2006 to January 19, 2007 (SOR 1.b to 1.h), for diagnosed alcohol dependence; and that she was charged with driving under the influence in about 1982 (SOR 1.i). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified a September 17, 2007 security clearance application by not disclosing the full extent of her alcohol treatment (SOR 2.a and 2.b). Applicant admitted the allegations under 1 Guideline G while denying that her alcohol consumption has led to the exercise of questionable judgment on the job. She denied that she deliberately falsified her security clearance application. After considering the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old test engineer specialist, who has been employed by a defense contractor since September 2007. She held a secret-level security clearance in the past, granted to her in June 1987, for her previous employment of 11 years with a different defense contractor. (Ex. 1, 4, L, Tr. 65.)

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Paul T. Rennick, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant continues to consume alcohol despite several detoxification treatments\nand her completion of a partial hospitalization program for diagnosed alcohol\ndependence in 2007. Alcohol consumption concerns are not mitigated, but personal\nconduct concerns were not established because Applicant did not deliberately falsify her\nSeptember 2007 security clearance application. Clearance denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that provided\nthe basis for its decision to deny her a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of\nDefense on September 1, 2006. \nSeptember 24, 2010\n\nThe SOR cites falsification of a September 17, 2007, Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire\n1\n(SOR 2.a) and a September 17, 2007 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SOR 2.b).\n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 17, 2009, and requested a\ndecision on the written record without a hearing. Around November 2009, after she had\nresponded to the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material, Applicant requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. On December 2, 2009, the case was assigned to me to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for her. On January 8, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for February 4,\n2010.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Nine Government exhibits (Ex. 1-9) and 12\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-L) were admitted without any objections. At the Government\u2019s\nrequest, I accepted the Government\u2019s FORM dated August 31, 2009, minus any\nattachments, as a supplement to the Government\u2019s closing argument. Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 16, 2010. Based on\nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant\ncontinued to consume alcohol despite alcohol-related treatment (SOR 1.a); that she\nreceived alcohol-related treatment in 1997, 2001, 2003, January 2006, and from\nDecember 19, 2006 to January 19, 2007 (SOR 1.b to 1.h), for diagnosed alcohol\ndependence; and that she was charged with driving under the influence in about 1982\n(SOR 1.i). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified\na September 17, 2007 security clearance application by not disclosing the full extent of\nher alcohol treatment (SOR 2.a and 2.b).  Applicant admitted the allegations under\n1\nGuideline G while denying that her alcohol consumption has led to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment on the job. She denied that she deliberately falsified her security\nclearance application. After considering the record evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old test engineer specialist, who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since September 2007. She held a secret-level security clearance in\nthe past, granted to her in June 1987, for her previous employment of 11 years with a\ndifferent defense contractor. (Ex. 1, 4, L, Tr. 65.) From June 1980 to June 1982, she\npursued her associate degree in computer programming at a local community college.\n(Ex. 1.) \nApplicant began to drink alcohol (beer, wine, or vodka) at about age 18, around\n1979, when socializing with friends on the weekends. (Ex. 2.) She consumed three or\nfour alcohol drinks when she drank (Ex. 2), to intoxication around once a month. On one\n\nMedical records of Applicant\u2019s detoxification treatment in September 2001 indicate a past psychiatric\n2\nhistory and hospitalization at facility X four years ago for six weeks. Information published by facility X\nindicates that its clinical and medical staffs have expertise \u201cnot only in treating chemical dependence, but also\nin psychiatric issues and those who are dually diagnosed.\u201d (Ex. 9.) It is unclear whether the primary focus of\nher 1997 treatment was on alcohol issues or mental health issues or both. Applicant informed DOHA in\nJanuary 2009 that she had six weeks of outpatient classes at facility X in 1997. (Ex. 4.)\n3\noccasion in about 1982, she was arrested for driving under the influence. She\ncompleted alcohol education classes, and the charge was expunged from her record.\n(Ex. 1, 4, C, K.)\nIn the fall of 1985, Applicant met her now ex-husband, and they married in July\n1990. They had their first daughter within the next two years, while Applicant worked\nfull-time and pursued her bachelor\u2019s degree in financial accounting. Their second\ndaughter was born in the mid-1990s. (Ex. 1.) Around 1997, Applicant attended six\nweeks of outpatient evening alcohol classes at a local alcohol rehabilitation facility\n(facility X) because she was starting to drink alcohol on a daily basis. (Ex. 4, Tr. 110-\n11.) In July 1998, Applicant went to work for a pharmaceutical company, initially in\nsystems quality management. (Ex. 1, D, L.)\nApplicant and her ex-husband grew apart, and they divorced in June 2001. (Ex.\n7.) Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption increased to five drinks at a sitting three or four\ntimes weekly due to the stress of the divorce and having to move from the family home.\n(Ex. 1.) By September 2001, she was drinking at least six beers a day and one gallon of\nhard liquor per week. From September 27, 2001, to October 1, 2001, she underwent\nvoluntary detoxification treatment at a hospital for medically diagnosed alcohol\ndependence. She had a history of treatment for depression  and was placed on an\n2\nantidepressant. Aftercare recommendations included that she attend daily Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) meetings, obtain a sponsor in AA, and continue treatment with her\npsychologist. (Ex. 7.)\nWith the help of nightly AA meetings, Applicant completely abstained from\nalcohol, but only for eight days after her discharge. She stopped attending AA and\nbegan drinking alcohol to intoxication twice a week. (Ex. 1, 8, I.) In 2003, and in\nDecember 2005, she underwent inpatient alcohol detoxification, but she continued to\ndrink. She experienced withdrawal symptoms (\u201cshakes\u201d) when she tried to stop drinking.\nBy early January 2006, she was drinking one and a half pints of vodka daily. She was\nstressed by being laid off from the employment she had held since 1998, and was\ngrieving the death of her brother within the last year. With her ex-husband and their\ndaughters expressing concern about her drinking, she voluntarily underwent alcohol\ndetoxification treatment from January 7, 2006, to January 11, 2006. She was diagnosed\nby the director of the hospital\u2019s chemical dependency program with alcohol dependence\nand acute anxiety, not otherwise specified. Applicant planned to participate in an\noutpatient program at facility X, but she was starting a new job with a consulting\ncompany, and had to wait 30 days for her insurance to become effective. Applicant was\nencouraged to consider scheduling her aftercare sooner. At discharge, Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate plans included \u201chopefully\u201d attending seven AA meetings per week, and\ndriving a different route home from work \u201cin order to avoid the liquor store.\u201d For\n\nTwo copies of the QNSP page containing question 21 were available for review (Ex. 1, A), with text\n3\nmissing from the left margin on both exhibits due to sloppy copying. On Exhibit 1 the date of initial treatment\nappears as \u201c2/2006,\u201d while on Exhibit A the date appears as \u201c/2006.\u201d Consistency with the electronic version\nof her security questionnaire and with facility X\u2019s medical records leads me to conclude that she indicated\n\u201c12/2006\" as the date of her admission to facility X.\n4\naftercare, her counselor recommended 12-step involvement, residential treatment,\noutpatient counseling at a minimum, and sober housing. (Ex. 8.)\nBy mid-December 2006, Applicant had been unable to maintain abstinence for a\nfull week. She was drinking two pints of liquor per day and spending $150 per month on\nalcohol. With the state\u2019s department of child services involved because of her drinking,\nand following a mental status examination at a local hospital, Applicant underwent\ndetoxification treatment at facility X from December 19, 2006, to December 23, 2006. At\ndischarge, she was referred to the facility\u2019s partial hospitalization program for treatment\nof diagnosed alcohol dependence. (Ex. 6.)\nOn December 25, 2006, Applicant was admitted to facility X\u2019s partial\nhospitalization/intensive outpatient treatment program. She was out of work on short\nterm disability, and was authorized to remain in treatment until January 19, 2007. At a\nsession on January 8, 2007, Applicant expressed concerns about her tendency to\nisolate, become depressed, and then drink, but she was allowed to spend her last week\nin the program as a commuter from home. She managed to remain abstinent while in\ntreatment, and she successfully completed the program. At discharge on January 19,\n2007, her mood was stable. Applicant was discharged on Campral medication and\nreferred for management of her anti-anxiety medication and for once weekly\nparticipation in an early recovery group. (Ex. 6.) AA meetings were recommended but\nnot mandated. Applicant attended various AA meetings in her area on a daily basis for\nsix months, and then occasionally thereafter until August 2007. She stopped attending\ndue to work and home demands, but she also was not comfortable with its spiritual\napproach (Ex. 1, 4, I, Tr. 84.), or with speaking in public. (Tr. 85.) Applicant continued\nwith an online \u201cSmart Recovery Program\u201d until early 2009. (Tr. 43, 87-88.) As of\nFebruary 2010, she was reading AA books, which she claims are of some benefit. (Tr.\n85-86.) She was never involved in the AA step program and was unable to recite any of\nthe AA steps when asked to do so by the Government at her hearing. (Tr. 86.)\nIn May 2007, Applicant was terminated from her employment with the consulting\ncompany due to poor performance not related to alcohol consumption on her part. (Ex.\n1, 4.) When she applied for her current position with the defense contractor, she\ncompleted by hand a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP) on July 23,\n2007. In response to question 21, concerning whether she had consulted with a mental\nhealth professional about a mental health related condition, Applicant indicated that she\nwas treated at facility X from December  2006 to January 2007.  She answered \u201cYes\u201d to\n3\nquestion 25 concerning any alcohol-related treatment in the last seven years, and\nadded, \u201cReported in 21.\u201d (Ex. 1, A.) She thought it was sufficient to disclose only her\nmost recent, most comprehensive treatment. (Tr. 33-34.) \n\nDOHA alleged falsification of a September 17, 2007 e-QIP (SOR 2.a) and September 17, 2007\n4\nQNSP. Both parties acknowledge that the allegations concerned the electronic version of the security\nclearance application (e-QIP) and not the handwritten QNSP, which Applicant completed in July 2007.\nApplicant testified she was intoxicated but \u201cto a limited extent.\u201d She was not so drunk that she was\n5\nunable to stand or could not converse. (Tr. 81.)\n5\nAround September 17, 2007, Applicant was required to review an electronic\nversion of the security clearance application completed from her July 2007 QNSP. (Tr.\n68-70.) She made no changes to her answer to question 21, or to question 25.  (Ex. 1,\n4\nB, Tr. 71.) Applicant did not think to add her detoxification treatments because she\nthought that the records of her prior treatments would be incorporated in the records of\nher more comprehensive treatment at facility X, given she had authorized facility X to\naccess those records. (Tr. 75.)\nApplicant was interviewed about her alcohol consumption and alcohol-related\ntreatment by an authorized investigator for the Government on December 21, 2007. She\ndenied that her use of alcohol had caused any adverse incidents because her 1982\ndrunk driving incident occurred so long ago and had been expunged from her record.\n(Ex. 2, I, Tr. 39.) Applicant discussed her treatment at facility X, but did not disclose her\nprevious detoxification treatments. She has no present recall of the investigator asking\nabout treatment previous to her rehabilitation at facility X. (Tr. 38, 41) She also denied\nthat there had been any negative impact on her family because of her drinking.\nApplicant indicated that while she had no present intent to drink, she could not rule out\ndrinking alcohol \u201cin minimal amount\u201d at a special occasion. (Ex. 2.) \nAdvised by clinicians at facility X to abstain completely from alcohol (Tr. 107.),\nApplicant consumed three to four glasses of wine with her sister at her sister\u2019s home in\nAugust 2007 in reaction to her mother\u2019s terminal illness. As of her subject interview with\nthe investigator on December 21, 2007, she had consumed two or three glasses of wine\nor beer on three other occasions while socializing with friends. She denied any intent to\ndrink alcohol in the future, but could not rule out the possibility of drinking on special\noccasions. (Ex. 2, I.)\nApplicant consumed six or seven drinks of vodka to intoxication  in November\n5\n2008, when she had to euthanize her dog. (Tr. 79-80.) As of January 2009, Applicant\nwas drinking alcohol on a weekly basis, in quantities that depended on the occasion,\nusually two to four beers or glasses of wine. She was not drinking before work and had\nnot reported to work under the influence of alcohol. (Ex. 4.) Nor was she frequenting\ndrinking establishments. (Ex. 5.) Applicant underwent a physical examination on\nJanuary 7, 2009, which showed her liver was \u201ctop normal to minimally enlarged.\u201d (Ex.\n5.)\nApplicant considers herself to have relapsed on three occasions after her\ntreatment at facility X, those being when her mother died, when she had to euthanize\n\nApplicant described a relapse as follows:\n6\nW hen you start drinking too\u2013where you\u2019re not controlling it. W here you\u2019re not limiting your\nconsumption to two or three and you\u2019re to the point where [you] feel [you are] getting\nintoxicated too often. Not intoxicated to the point of stumbling down, but to the point where\nyou\u2019re having three drinks five times a day or something. (Tr. 92-93.)\n6\nher dog, and when she was laid off from the pharmaceutical company.  (Tr. 43-44, 92,\n6\n105.) In the year preceding her February 2010 hearing on her clearance eligibility, she\ndrank on average three times per week. In mid-January 2010, she consumed three\nmixed drinks consisting of vodka and orange juice. (Tr. 83-84.) Her current boyfriend\ndrinks alcohol, and she has consumed alcohol with him. (Tr. 79.) She consumed three\nor four beers after work on January 26, 2010,  four beers with her boyfriend at home on\nJanuary 29, 2010, and three glasses of wine with him on January 31, 2010. (Tr. 77-79,\n83.) She keeps alcohol at her residence on occasion. She purchased the beer she\ndrank on January 29, 2010, from a local liquor store. (Tr. 99.)\nApplicant denies drinking to intoxication, i.e., to the point of being unable to stand\nor having slurred speech. (Tr. 45, 81.) Applicant does not believe that she has a current\nproblem with alcohol (\u201cI believe that I am a functioning, competent mother,\nemployee\u2013that I\u2019ve had no issues at work. I\u2019ve had no issues with driving. I\u2019ve had no\nissues with family. I currently moderate my consumption.\u201d). (Tr. 89-90.) Applicant\nbelieves that she has her drinking under control and that she is not going to have\nanother relapse. (Tr. 93.) While her coworkers are unaware of her alcohol problem (Tr.\n91.), Applicant\u2019s boyfriend and some friends do not let her consume more than \u201ca\ncouple\u201d of alcohol drinks \u201cbecause they realize the issue that it can potentially become.\u201d\n(Tr. 93.)\nCharacter References\nApplicant has not allowed her alcohol problem to negatively affect her job\nperformance, including while she held a security clearance for a previous employer. (Ex.\nE.) She has met or exceeded her employer\u2019s requirements since the start of her\nemployment within a defense contractor\u2019s engineering configuration management\ngroup. (Ex. F, G, H.) Her work output for her first year on the job was in the acceptable\nrange and of satisfactory quality to require minimal rework. Applicant also showed that\nshe was able to function effectively in a high pressure and performance-oriented\nenvironment. (Ex. E, G.) By late February 2010, she had recommended several very\ngood process improvements and was considered to be a valuable asset to the team by\nher immediate supervisor. (Ex. E, H.) Her overall work performance for the March 2009\nthrough February 2010 rating period exceeded her job requirements. (Ex. H.) \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\n\n7\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant has had one alcohol-related incident, a drunk driving\noffense from 1982, that would implicate AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\n\n8\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual\nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d Despite her long history of\nstruggles with alcohol, there has been no impact on her work performance, so AG \u00b6\n22(b), \u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an\nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d is inapplicable. \nHowever, the responsibility for protecting classified information is not limited to\nduty hours. She coped with marital problems in 1997 by drinking alcohol on a daily\nbasis. While in the process of her divorce in 2001, she drank at least six beers a day\nand a half gallon of vodka per week. By 2005, she was experiencing withdrawal\nsymptoms when she tried to stop drinking. As of January 2006, she was drinking 1.5\npints of vodka per day. After undergoing another detoxification treatment program, she\nwas unable to abstain completely from alcohol for a full week. By December 2006, she\nwas consuming two pints of liquor per day. AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption\nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d applies. \nFurthermore, she has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent by staff physicians\nand licensed substance abuse clinicians. AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program,\u201d are implicated.\nAG \u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d is applicable because of her relapse\nafter January 19, 2007. Treatments previous to the partial inpatient hospitalization\nprogram at facility X consisted primarily of alcohol education or detoxification protocols.\nBut after receiving comprehensive cognitive behavioral therapy and relapse prevention\ncounseling at facility X, Applicant admittedly drank to intoxication for several days, up to\ntwo weeks time, around August 2007 and in November 2008. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s\nongoing consumption of  three or four beers or glasses of wine three times a week, and\nof three mixed drinks on occasion, raises serious concerns about her reform, given she\nhas been advised to abstain by treating clinicians at facility X.\nAlthough Applicant was limiting her drinking to off-duty hours as of February\n2010, her abusive relationship with alcohol is too recent and recurrent to favorably\nconsider mitigating condition AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much times has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or\nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser),\u201d is implicated in part. Excepting court-mandated alcohol education\nfor her drunk driving offense, Applicant sought treatment on her own when she felt she\nwas losing control over her drinking in the past. But this does not satisfy the abstinence\n\n9\ncomponent of AG \u00b6 23(b) triggered because of her diagnosed alcohol dependency. And,\nwhile she responded \u201cyes\u201d to whether she is an alcoholic (\u201cI guess based on the records\nof what they go by and what they consider alcohol dependent\u2013yes.\u201d Tr. 89), her current\nconsumption pattern of up to four glasses of wine or beer on a regular basis raises\ndoubts about whether she accepts the diagnosis and is committed to her sobriety.\nAG \u00b6 23(c), \u201cthe individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and\nis making satisfactory progress,\u201d is designed to encourage employees to seek treatment\nwithout fear of denial or loss of their clearance eligibility. At the same time, the\nDepartment of Defense justifiably requires current employees to make the progress\nnecessary to avoid a relapse and need for further treatment. Alcohol education and\ndetoxification are not the equivalent of alcohol treatment if they do not address the\nunderlying issues and triggers that may lead to a relapse. While the evidence warrants\ntreating her latest admission to facility X as her first intensive alcohol treatment\nprogram, Applicant cannot satisfy AG \u00b6 23(c). She is not currently in treatment and\ndoubts persist about her recovery in light of her post-treatment relapses.\nApplicant\u2019s latest treatment at facility X fulfills the rehabilitation component of AG\n\u00b6 23(d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare. . . .\u201d Applicant met her initial treatment\ngoals. At discharge, she was referred to self-help groups, and I accept her testimony\nthat she attended AA and remained abstinent until August 2007. For those seven or\neight months, Applicant demonstrated \u201ca clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization,\u201d which is\nalso  required under AG \u00b6 23(d). But her drinking since August 2007 is contrary to\nclinical advice, and she presented no recent assessment from a qualified medical\nprofessional or substance abuse clinician that could dispel the security concerns raised\nby her present consumption. A physical examination showing her liver to be \u201ctop normal\nto minimally enlarged\u201d is not a substitute for \u201ca favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized treatment program.\u201d \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant does not dispute that she failed to disclose her detoxification\ntreatments on her initial QNSP completed in July 2007, or on the e-QIP version she\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances\n7\nin which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered:\n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation,\nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated\nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive\nSection 6.3.\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004)); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n24, 2003)).\n10\nreviewed in September 2007. However, she denies willful concealment in that she acted\non belief that information about her detoxification treatments in 2001, 2003, and January\n2006 by other providers could be accessed through facility X because she had\nauthorized release of her clinical records to facility X. I accept her explanation as\ncredible. It is unlikely that Applicant would have listed her recent, more comprehensive\ntreatment at facility X if she wanted to conceal her alcohol problem from the\nGovernment. Although Applicant had an obligation to list each inpatient detoxification\ntreatment separately on both the QNSP and e-QIP, AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts form any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d does not apply because\nshe lacked the intent to deceive or conceal. \nAs accurately pointed out by the Government, Applicant could have been more\nforthcoming about her alcohol problem and her treatment when interviewed by a\nGovernment investigator in December 2007.   Applicant told the investigator that she\n7\ndrank to intoxication on average twice a week from 2001 to December 2006, when she\nentered facility X. Clinical records show episodes of daily drinking in heavy quantities by\nApplicant in 2001, January 2006, and again in December 2006. Applicant told the\ninvestigator that she had not attended treatment programs other than the December\n2006 to January 2007 program at facility X. While she had several inpatient\ndetoxification treatments, they were not regarded by her, nor were they shown to be,\nalcohol rehabilitation programs. Applicant does not dispute that she denied any arrests\nwhen she had been arrested for drunk driving 25 years ago, but it was because the\ncharge had been expunged. Applicant also denied any family problems because of her\ndrinking, which, in contrast, is difficult to accept, given that the state\u2019s department of\nchild services became involved around December 2006 because of her drinking. Yet, It\ndoes not compel me to conclude that she falsified her security clearance application.\nConcerns about her lack of candor on the QNSP or e-QIP are not substantiated (see\nAG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability\u201d).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\n\nAG \u00b6 2(a) requires consideration of the following nine factors:\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nTreatment is viewed favorably, but adverse findings are warranted because of the abusive drinking\n9\nthat led her to seek the treatment. \n11\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a).  \n8\nApplicant bears a substantial burden of mitigation, especially where she does not\nfully satisfy any of the Guideline G mitigating conditions. She has not allowed her\nabusive use of alcohol to interfere with her work performance. But security is a 24-hour-\nper-day responsibility, and Applicant\u2019s present drinking habits pose an unacceptable risk\nto her sobriety. Even if I accept that she has consumed alcohol to intoxication only\nfollowing the deaths of her mother and  her pet, she consumes three or four drinks three\ntimes a week. This drinking would not be problematic but for her history of abuse to the\npoint of medically diagnosed dependency and well-documented struggles to achieve\nsobriety. Her current support network, which consists of friends (including a boyfriend)\nwho also drink alcohol, is not likely to provide her the guidance and support necessary\nto achieve the abstinence recommended by the clinicians at facility X, or to avoid\ndrinking to intoxication if faced with a stressful event. I recognize that AA is not for\neveryone, but one has to question whether just reading AA pamphlets is enough. She\nhas yet to admit that she is powerless over alcohol.\nApplicant\u2019s character references attest to her being a good mother, and a reliable\nand productive employee. These recommendations weigh in her favor in assessing\nwhether her alcohol problem presents an unacceptable security risk. She has shown\ngood judgment in seeking detoxification and then alcohol rehabilitation treatment when\nshe felt she had lost control over her drinking. At the same time, any doubts must be\nresolved in favor of national security. Her evidence in reform is insufficient to overcome\nthe Guideline G concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant9\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M.

Delaney Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n__________\nDecision\n__________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Foreign Preference\n(Guideline C) because he holds a valid United Kingdom (U.K.) passport, and became a\nU.K. citizen in 2005. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn October 23, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire For\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF\n86). On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\nmodified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C.\nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative\nDecember 31, 2008\n\n2\n                                     \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on\nAugust 28, 2008, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. Documents were attached to the answer with explanatory information. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated October 3, 2008, was\nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided no additional\nmaterial. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the factual allegations of the SOR in his answer but\ndenied the general allegation that he has a preference for another country than the U.S.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 41-year-old project engineer who was born in the U.S. He holds an\nMBA from a major U.S. business school. Since May 2005, he has worked for a U.S.\ndefense construction contractor. He lives in the United Kingdom (U.K.) where he has\nworked since 1999. His first employment was as a strategy director for company in the\nU.K. until 2002. He then worked in the U.K. and Spain for a major international oil\ncompany until he was made redundant in 2005. He became a citizen of the U.K. in\n2005. He has an active U.K. passport that was issued in February 2005. His present\nwork requires that he travel frequently to other countries in Europe.\nApplicant is married to a U.S. citizen and has three children all of whom were\nborn in either the U.K. or Spain. They all hold dual citizenship with the U.S. and U.K.\naccording to information supplied on his SF 86. He has a foreign bank account with\nsome funds on deposit in the account. \nApplicant declines to surrender his U.K. passport since he finds it is helpful in his\ntravels in Europe for his employer.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n3\n                                     \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered For access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\nAnalysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude that the following Adjudicative Guidelines provide the standard for\nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n\n4\n                                     \nGuideline C Foreign Preference\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with\nrespect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG \u00b6 9: \n\u201c[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or\nother such benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business\ninterests in another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\n\n5\n                                     \nThe fact that Applicant holds a foreign passport and is a dual citizen has raised\nsecurity concerns under Sec. a. 3. of the guideline.\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or\nbirth in a foreign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when\nthe individual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant\nsecurity authority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United\nStates Government.\nSince Applicant declines in his answer to surrender his U.K. passport, I\nconclude that the security concerns arising from dual citizenship and holding a foreign\npassport have not been mitigated by application of any of the above mitigating\nconditions. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n\n6\n                                     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference allegations. While there is no reason\nother than the dual citizenship and passport issue to question Applicant\u2019s ability to hold\na security clearance, his refusal to surrender the foreign passport precludes a finding\nin his favor. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and\nsupporting evidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative\nprocess, and interpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has\nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude\nhe is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline C: AGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel, \nFor Applicant: Lucia E. Casale, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States at age 16, became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2000, and has lived in the United States for 26 years. He invalidated his \nNigerian passport and mitigated the foreign preference and foreign influence security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on July 17, 2006. On August 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 15, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 31, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on December 10, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through \n7, which were received without objection (Tr. 19). GE 7 was not admitted, but \nconsidered for administrative notice purposes only.2 Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted 16 exhibits, marked AE 1 through 16, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 18, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (with \nexplanations), except for SOR \u00b6 1.a, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old civil engineer. He was born and raised in Nigeria in \none of the most stables cities in the country (Tr. 40, 42, 52, GE 1). In 1982, at age 16, \nhe entered the United States under a student visa. While attending college, he stayed \nwith his uncle, who was a U.S. citizen (Tr. 77). In May 1987, he received a degree in \ncivil engineering from a U.S. university (Tr. 53). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \nAugust 2000 and received his U.S. passport shortly thereafter (Tr. 53-54).  \n \nAfter college, Applicant worked for two private U.S. companies (Tr. 55). In 1989, \nhe formed his own engineering design company (Tr. 56). Applicant is the sole owner of \nhis company, and is the company\u2019s facility security officer. In 1998, his company \nbecame a construction-oriented company, building roads, bridges, and other structures. \nThrough the years, Applicant has worked in numerous government construction projects \nin the United States and overseas. After working in over 20 overseas construction \nprojects for U.S. government agencies, in 2005 Applicant bid on several overseas \nconstruction projects that required Applicant and his company to have access to \nclassified information (Tr. 39-40, 56-60). Two of the construction projects were to be \nperformed in Nigeria.  \n \nA U.S. government agency sponsored Applicant and his company for a facility \nsecurity clearance at the secret level. He applied for his security clearance in July 2006. \nApplicant was issued an interim security clearance that allowed him access to classified \ninformation. His interim clearance was revoked as a result of the security concerns \noutlined in the SOR and he was disqualified from one of the construction projects (Tr. \n40). Applicant\u2019s business travel to Nigeria in 2005 and during the following years was in \n \n2  Department Counsel\u2019s October 23, 2008, motion asked that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts concerning the government of Nigeria. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were considered and included in the record as GE 7 for identification.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \npreparation for bidding on the contracts, or as a result of his winning the U.S. contracts \nin Nigeria. \n \nIn 2005, Applicant renewed his Nigerian passport. It was easier for him to travel \nto Nigeria with it than having to secure a Visa every time he traveled. He only used the \nNigerian passport to travel to Nigeria, and most of his travel was related to his \nconstruction projects there. From 1982 to 2005, Applicant traveled twice to Nigeria: in \n2001 to bury his father, and in 2005, to evaluate business opportunities (Tr. 84-85). In \n2006, he travelled three times to Nigeria: in February to bury his uncle, and in June and \nDecember 2006 for business related matters. During 2007, Applicant traveled twice to \nNigeria on business related matters. In 2008, Applicant traveled to Nigeria to bury his \nmother, and for business related matters in June 2008. He intends to travel to Nigeria \nfrequently in the future to comply with his contractual obligations. Since he invalidated \nhis Nigerian passport, Applicant received a long-term visitor\u2019s visa to travel from the \nUnited States to Nigeria (Tr. 45). \n \nApplicant claimed he did not know his possession and use of the Nigerian \npassport would raise security concerns until after he received the pending SOR. As \nsoon as he was made aware of the concerns, he stopped using his Nigerian passport \n(Tr. 45). On September 22, 2008, Applicant attempted to surrender his Nigerian \npassport by mailing it to DOHA (Appellate Exhibit 1). DOHA returned the passport to \nhim. At his hearing, Applicant presented his invalidated Nigerian passport (with holes \npunched on it and the picture page cut in half) (AE 16, Tr. 60-61). When asked whether \nhe was willing to surrender his Nigerian citizenship, Applicant answered that he had \nrenounced it when he swore allegiance to the United States during his naturalization \nceremony. He strongly averred he is only a U.S. citizen and his loyalty is only to the \nUnited States.  \n \nIn November 2006, Applicant opened a bank account in Nigeria and transferred \n$170,000 from the United States into his Nigerian account (Tr. 88). Applicant transferred \nthe money to support the day-to-day operations of his construction project for a U.S. \nagency. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows that he had won a bid for a construction project for \na U.S. agency in Nigeria. As of his hearing, he still had the Nigerian bank account. He \nmaintains a monthly balance of approximately $100,000 in the account to cover his \nconstruction company\u2019s expenses in Nigeria. In 2007-2008, Applicant bid on three \nadditional construction contracts offered by a U.S. government agency to be performed \nin South America and Africa (Tr. 59-60). \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s father died in 2001, he inherited approximately \u00bc of an acre of \nland in Nigeria. Applicant claimed he is not sure where the property is located, or its \ncurrent estimated value. He averred he is not interested in the property and does not \nintend to claim it (Tr. 48).  \n \nApplicant married his 35-year-old Nigerian-born wife in 1998 in the United States \n(Tr. 54, 76). She entered the United States under a student visa in 1997. She attended \na preeminent U.S. university and received a physician\u2019s degree (Tr. 78, 93). They have \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntwo children born in the United States: a 10-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter. \nShe is a permanent resident alien and has applied for U.S. citizenship (Tr. 55). She \nworks as a physician at a preeminent U.S. hospital. \n \nApplicant and his wife own a residence in the United States, worth approximately \n$750,000. They also own a U.S. undeveloped track of land, worth approximately \n$750,000 (Tr. 69-71). Additionally, they have U.S. investments worth approximately \n$10,000. Applicant\u2019s receives a yearly salary from his company of $150,000. His current \nU.S. government construction project in Nigeria is worth approximately $22 million. His \nexpected profit from this contract is around 5% or $1.1 million (Tr. 91). Applicant and his \nwife have no financial assets, and own no property (other than the \u00bc acre of land) or \ninvestments in Nigeria. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 74-year-old mother-in-law is a citizen and part time resident of Nigeria \n(Tr. 66-67). According to Applicant, she is independently wealthy, and owns numerous \nreal estate rental properties in Nigeria. She is the only one of his wife\u2019s immediate \nrelatives living in Nigeria (Tr. 90). Applicant testified his mother-in-law lives \napproximately nine to 10 months of the year in the United States and two months in \nNigeria. She is a U.S. permanent legal resident, and is applying for citizenship (Tr. 66). \nWhile she is living in Nigeria, Applicant has contact with her approximately once a \nmonth. He is not aware of the frequency of his wife\u2019s contact with her mother when she \nis in Nigeria. \n \nApplicant claimed that neither he nor his wife or any of their immediate relatives \never served in the Nigerian military forces. They have never worked for the Nigerian \ngovernment or for any government affiliated company (Tr. 77).  \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s aunts and uncles live in the United States and are either U.S. \ncitizens or in the process of applying for citizenship (Tr. 81-82). He has four siblings, two \nsisters and two brothers. One of his sisters is a U.S. naturalized citizen, and one of his \nbrothers is a U.S. permanent resident alien. His second brother is a Nigerian citizen and \ncurrently lives with his family in the United States (Tr. 41). He is working as an engineer \nfor a French company, and was assigned to a three-year tour of work with a subsidiary \nof his company in the United States. His second sister is a Nigerian citizen and resident \n(Tr. 51). She owns a clothing business in Nigeria and travels frequently to visit with her \nfamily living in the United States (Tr. 41, 64). \n \nApplicant strongly averred he is a proud American citizen. He has been in the \nUnited States for the last 26 years and almost all of his relatives live in the United \nStates. He believes there is no way any of his relatives, or foreign government, can \ninfluence him in a way contrary to his immediate family\u2019s interest or the interest of the \nUnited States (Tr. 40). \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Nigeria is a federal republic \ncomposed of 36 states and a capital territory. The government\u2019s human rights record is \npoor, and government officials at all levels commit serious human rights abuses. Areas \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nof the country are marked by serious political instability and outbreaks of armed conflict \nbetween religious, political, and ethnic factions. The lack of law and order in the country \nposes considerable risks to travelers. \n \nThe Nigerian government provides strong diplomatic support to U.S. government \ncounter-terrorism efforts. It has condemned terrorist attacks against the United States \nand supported military actions against the Taliban and Al-Qaida. It also has played a \nleading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in their region. The \nUnited States provides the people of Nigeria with substantial financial assistance in \nareas such as public health, education, and in their efforts of developing effective \ninstitutions of democratic governance. Nigeria is an important trading partner of the \nUnited States. There is no evidence of economic competition with the United States, or \nthat Nigeria has or ever had an intelligence gathering program targeting U.S. economic, \nindustrial, or military critical technologies.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is \u201cwhen an individual acts in such \na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he \nor she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2005 renewal and use of his Nigerian passport, his opening of a \nNigerian bank account, and his inheritance of a \u00bc acre of land in Nigeria raise foreign \npreference security concerns. AG \u00b6 10: \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation \nof foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign \npassport,\u201d and \u201c(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country,\u201d apply.  \n \nAfter considering all the foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11, I \nfind that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b): \u201cThe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship,\u201d and 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed,\u201d apply.  \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000 and was issued a U.S. \npassport shortly thereafter. He renewed his Nigerian passport in 2005 and used it, in \npreference to his U.S. passport, to travel to Nigeria numerous times between 2005 and \n2008. He used the Nigerian passport because of convenience, i.e., he did not have to \n\n \n7 \n \n \ngo through the process of requesting a visa. He did not know that his renewal of the \nNigerian passport would raise security concerns. As soon as he was made aware of the \nsecurity concerns raised by his use and possession of his Nigerian passport, Applicant \nattempted to surrender and later destroyed his Nigerian passport. \n \nI considered that Applicant has a Nigerian bank account (with a substantial \ndeposit of money) that he opened in 2006 to run the day-to-day operations of his \nconstruction projects in Nigeria. Considering the totality of the circumstances of his \ncase, his foreign bank account does not raise serious security concerns. Applicant has \nestablished a bona fide record of performing construction projects for U.S. government \nagencies in the United States and abroad. In 2005-2006, Applicant won a bid for a \nconstruction project for a U.S. agency in Nigeria. The bank account and the money \nwere incidental to his performance of the construction project. But for the construction \nproject, I conclude Applicant would not have opened the bank account in Nigeria. \n \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s inheritance of a \u00bc acre of land in Nigeria. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances of his case, I conclude that the possible \nvalue of such property is greatly outweighed by Applicant\u2019s long and well rooted \nconnections to the United States, his business in the United States, and the net worth \nvalue of his assets in the United States.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is:  \n \n \n\u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d AG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in a foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk or foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts (at least once a \nmonth) and a close relationship of affection and/or obligation with his mother-in-law and \nsiblings, who are residents and citizens of Nigeria. These contacts create a risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that \nNigerian agents or criminals may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the \nUnited States. His connection to his family members also create a potential conflict of \ninterest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about \nhis desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n  \nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that mitigating condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and (f) apply. Applicant has strong \nfeelings of affection and a strong sense of obligation to his mother-in-law and siblings. \nThe closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts with his \nsiblings and wife\u2019s mother, their travels to the United States to visit Applicant and his \nfamily, and his travels to Nigeria. Notwithstanding, Applicant established it is unlikely he \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his family and \nthe interests of the United States. Applicant\u2019s family members in Nigeria live routine \nlives, they are not involved in politics, employed by the Nigerian government or its \nmilitary forces.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his family in Nigeria has been for the most part \ntelephonic, with occasional reciprocal visits. From 1982 to 2005, he traveled once on \nfamily related matters (to bury his father), and from 2005 to 2008 he traveled twice to \nbury his uncle and mother. Applicant\u2019s all other travel to Nigeria has been business \nrelated and resulted from his winning of construction contracts in the United States for \nwork to be performed in Nigeria for a U.S. government agency. I do not believe \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his family in Nigeria creates a heightened risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, \nI considered Nigeria\u2019s form of government.6 Nigeria is a developing country that, so far, \npossesses no intelligence, economic, or industrial threat to the United States. \nNotwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights record, there is no evidence its \ngovernment seeks classified and industrial/economic information from the United \nStates. Nor is there evidence of the Nigerian government mistreating relatives of U.S. \ncitizens or U.S. citizens to obtain such information. Additionally, given the existing \nrelationship between the governments of the United States and Nigeria, it is unlikely \nNigeria would risk loosing an important trading partner and the financial support of the \nUnited States. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United States for over 26 years. \n \n \n6  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they \nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level \nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nHe came to the United States at age 16 and is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. His wife is \nin the process of becoming a U.S. citizen and their children were born in the United \nStates. All of their financial and business interests are in the United States. Applicant \nhas established himself as an American citizen. He is a successful entrepreneur with an \nestablished reputation as a reliable government contractor. He continues this track \nrecord of diligent labor in his current construction contracts with Government agencies. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) applies because Applicant\u2019s business is based in the United States, not \nin Nigeria. Applicant has established a bona fide record of performing over 20 \nconstruction projects for U.S. government agencies in the United States and abroad. In \n2006, Applicant won a bid for a $22 million construction project for a U.S. agency in \nNigeria. The bank account and the money deposited there were incidental to his \nperformance of the construction project. But for the construction project, I conclude \nApplicant would not have opened the bank account in Nigeria.  \n \nApplicant has continued to bid (in the United States) on additional multimillion \ndollar construction projects for U.S. agencies abroad. Applicant has a substantial \namount of money in a Nigerian bank ($100,000). Notwithstanding, balancing the value \nof his Nigerian bank account against the value of his current and future U.S. contracts, \nand the expected profits from those contracts, I conclude Applicant\u2019s financial and \nproperty interests in Nigeria could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or \npressure him.  \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence shows it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nsiblings or mother-in-law and the interests of the United States. He has mitigated the \nGuideline B security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been in the United \nStates for over 26 years and a naturalized U.S. citizen for around eight years. He \nattended college and received his civil engineering degree in the United States. His wife \nbecame a physician in the United States and is employed by a well known hospital. She \nis in the process of completing her U.S. naturalization process, and their children were \nborn in the United States. His only close relatives living in Nigeria are his mother-in-law \n(who lives most of the year in the United States) and two of his siblings (one of which \nwill reside in the United States with his family for the next three years). He and his wife \nown property and have financial interests mainly in the United States (except for the \u00bc \nacre land he inherited), and they have embraced the United States way of life. Applicant \nhas established himself as a reliable defense contractor and there is no evidence that \nhe has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of classified \ninformation. \n \nAfter carefully considering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, I conclude he is not in a \nposition where he may be induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests. He is not vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by his mother-in-law, siblings, or the government of Nigeria. \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns arising from \nhis foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Paul Bennett, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 12, 2009 and did not want a \nhearing. The Government requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 9, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 19, \n2009, and after coordinating the date with both sides I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on April 28, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through H. Department Counsel did not object and they were admitted. I left the \nrecord open until May 11, 2009, to allow Applicant time to submit additional exhibits, \nwhich he did. Applicant provided by mail exhibits marked as AE I through M.1 He \nprovided by fax exhibits marked as N through T. It is noted there are some duplicates of \nthe same exhibits, but to ensure all exhibits were considered I included them all. \nDepartment Counsel responded and had no objection to the additional exhibits and they \nwere admitted. Department Counsel\u2019s response was marked as Hearing Exhibit I. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 5, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted the allegation in SOR 1.a and denied all of the remaining \nallegations. He also responded to the Letter of SOR allegations as follows:  \n \nTo continue: I reported you to [employer] lawyers and internal security that \nI felt you were trying to blackmail me with my job over this credit report. I \nnow have you on record with our lawyers and security to your action of \ndigging into my credit report and trying to use it against me. As you can \nsee I can not be blackmailed.  \n \nI have enclosed a bank statement and you can see I keep plenty of money \nin my checking account that could pay off the credit report claims if it was \nnot for the fact I am contesting some of the claims like the Bank of \nAmerican that tried to charge me for an account that was closed.  \n \nApplicant provided a copy of his bank statement that showed his checking account had \nan available balance of $21,632 in December 2008.2 \n \nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He attended college for two years and received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in aeronautical engineering. He has worked for his present employer \nsince June 2006, as a manufacturing process engineer. From March 2004 to June \n2006, he was the President of a company. From October 2003 to March 2004 he \nworked as an engineer for another employer. Applicant\u2019s security clearance application \n(SCA) reflects that he has worked continuously from 1995 to the present except for a \nperiod from April 2001 to November 2001, when the company he worked for went out of \nbusiness. Applicant has been married three times. He has been married to his current \n \n1 When marking the exhibits the letter \u201cK\u201d was inadvertently omitted. There is no exhibit \u201cK.\u201d \n \n2 Answer to SOR. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nwife since 2000. He has four grown children. He was in the Army from 1969 to 1971 and \nin the National Guard from 1971 to 1985. He was honorably discharged.3  \n \n \nApplicant testified that from 1999 to 2000 he worked for a company in State A \nthat eventually went bankrupt. He then moved to State B and did consulting work and \nother jobs. Applicant testified that he had periods of unemployment while living in State \nB. He testified he was unable to find work while in State B. He stated that during a four-\nyear-period he was unemployed or underemployed for two years and when he was \nworking for some companies he would not receive compensation.4  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he lived in State B from 2001 to 2006 and while there he \nlived in hotels and later got an efficiency apartment and then stayed in a condominium.5 \nApplicant\u2019s SCA reflects that from February 2005 to June 2006 he lived in State B and \nfrom November 1999 to March 2005 he lived State A. The SCA question specifically \nstates: \u201cProvide a detailed entry for each place you have lived in the last 7 years. All \nperiods must be accounted for in your list. Do not list a permanent address when you \nwere actually living at a school address. etc.\u201d In addition, it stated: \u201cBe sure to indicate \nthe actual physical location of your residence\u2026. Be sure to specify your location, as \nclosely as possible.\u201d6 Regarding the discrepancy Applicant\u2019s stated the following: \u201cWell, \nmy residence is my house, and you know, I was not a resident of Florida at the time. I \nwas a resident of Virginia. I was living down there, but it was only on a temporary basis. \nI didn\u2019t consider myself a resident in Florida.\u201d7 I did not find Applicant credible.  \n \n \nThere are five delinquent debts, including one judgment alleged in the SOR, \ntotaling $11,857. Applicant admitted the unpaid judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.a in his answer. \nHe was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \non February 14, 2008. At the time he stated he had no knowledge of the creditor, \nhowever he suspected the debt had something to do with a dispute he had with a \ndentist dating back to 1999 or 2000. He had dental work done and he testified that the \nestimated cost of the work was $3,600. He testified: \u201cI don\u2019t even think I received a copy \nof the bill for $11,000 if I can remember.\u201d8 He later received a bill for about $11,000. He \nadmitted he refused to pay the bill. He stated he was not aware of any attempts made \nby the creditor to collect payments. In his statement he stated he paid the bill for several \nmonths and did not recall how many payments he made or the amounts, or the total he \n \n3 Tr. 21 26, 41-46. \n \n4 Tr.71-74. \n \n5 Tr. 24. \n \n6 I have not considered the discrepancies between Applicant\u2019s SCA and his testimony for \ndisqualifying purposes, but have considered it when analyzing the whole person and his credibility. \n \n7 Tr. 47-48, 71-77. \n \n8 Tr. 50. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \npaid or if there was a remaining balance. He stated he never received notification from \nany court or collection agency. He made no attempts to contact the dentist and pay the \nadditional funds. At the time of his interview he said he would satisfy the judgment if it \nwas proved that he was responsible. Applicant\u2019s testimony contradicted statements he \nmade to the OPM investigator.9  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that at the time he saw the dentist he did not have \ndental insurance. He later moved and said he had no money. There is no evidence that \nhe provided a forwarding address to the dentist. On June 3, 2008, he sent the creditor a \nletter disputing that he owed the amount alleged. His letter stated it was the first time he \nhad heard from the creditor about the alleged debt. He further inquired \u201cPlease explain \nthe nature of the alleged debt, that is, what the money I allegedly owe is for.\u201d10 On April \n15, 2009, Appellant received a letter from the creditor, noting the current balance due as \n$20,402.47. The letter referred to a conversation between Applicant and the creditor \nand an offer to settle the debt for $5,000. Applicant had not made any payments to the \ncreditor by the date of his hearing. Applicant is purchasing a house and did not want to \nuse his savings to make the payment to the creditor until he closes on the house to \nensure he has enough money. He stated at his hearing he considered a partial \npayment, but the creditor wanted the full amount. Applicant has been aware of this debt \nfor a considerable period of time.11 The record remained open to afford him additional \ntime to provide documentation regarding the debt. Applicant stated that regardless of \nwhether he closes on his house he would pay the $5,000.12 Applicant provided proof \nthat he made a payment of $1,000 to the creditor on May 6, 2009, with a promise to \nsatisfy the additional $4,000 by June 15, 2009. The creditor acknowledged the payment \nand next payment date.13 \n \n \n \nThe delinquent debt in SOR 1.b ($88) Applicant stated is for a charge on a \nsavings account that was closed. He stated:  \n \nI went to the bank Saturday, and they couldn\u2019t even find it at first. Actually \nthey can\u2019t find it at all. And I\u2019ve got--she gave me phone number, and \nwe\u2019re still researching it. I\u2019ve got to call this phone number and research it \nsome more to find out why there\u2019s an $88 fee there. And they wouldn\u2019t \naccept a check Saturday when I went there to give them a check for it, \neven though I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t owe it.14 \n \n9 Tr.35-37, 48-54. \n \n10 AE H. \n \n11 Tr. 55-60. \n \n12 Tr. 86. \n \n13 Tr. 35-37, 48-60; AE N. \n \n14 Tr. 37-38. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nHe stated that he talked to the creditor about the charge sometime in 2004 or 2005. The \ncharge was incurred because his account went below a certain dollar amount. He stated \nhe went to the bank to resolve the account, but they would not accept payment. He did \nnot provide an account number. The account was in collection. Applicant was aware of \nthe debt at least since the date of his interview on February 14, 2008. Applicant paid the \naccount on May 1, 2009.15 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.c ($89) is to the gas company. Appellant had a residence in \nState A that he vacated in 2000-2001, however his daughter remained in the house. \nThe house was sold in 2006. He paid this debt on July 28, 2008.16   \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.d ($1,981) is for a loan that Applicant believed was from \nsometime around 1996 to 1998. During his interview with OPM he stated he had no \nknowledge of the debt. He contacted the creditor requesting information. Applicant did \nnot include an account number on his inquiry and did not sign the letter.17 He admitted \nhe did not pay the debt. It was reported on his credit report as of October 23, 2008.18 \nApplicant stated the debt has now dropped off his credit report. On April 29, 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the creditor with an account number expressing \ninterest in resolving the debt.19 \n \n \nApplicant stated that the debt in SOR 1.e ($298) was for his last telephone bill \nfrom his house in State A. He testified he moved in 2000-2001. He paid the debt in \nDecember 2008.20 \n \n \nApplicant moved to State C in September 2007. He stated he is current on all of \nhis bills. He has approximately $13,000 in savings that he wants to use for the closing \ncosts on a house he is purchasing. He is not sure when he will close on his house. He \nbelieves he will owe approximately $4,000 on his 2008 tax return. He earns \napproximately $120,000 a year. I have considered the character letters provided by \nApplicant.21  \n \n \nAt times I found Applicant\u2019s testimony and explanations to be evasive, somewhat \nconvoluted and not credible.  \n \n \n15 Tr. 37-38, 60-64; GE 4, AE M. \n \n16 Tr. 64-65; AE D and E. \n \n17 Tr. 38-39-AE H.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that have remained unpaid for years, despite \nhaving the income and assets to resolve the debts since at least 2006. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he still has delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid, despite his ability to pay them. He has been aware of his debts and only \nrecently resolved some of the small ones. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. I find (a) does not apply. For mitigating condition (b) \nto be fully applicable Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nFor a period of time Applicant did not have sufficient means to satisfy his debts due to \nhis employment situation. However, Applicant has been working for his present \nemployer since June 2006 and has provided overwhelming proof that he has the money \nto pay all of his delinquent debts, but he has not. He did not address the smaller debts \nin the SOR until his security clearance became an issue. Regarding the largest debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, a judgment, he admitted in his answer that he owed this debt and admitted \nhe had the money to pay it, yet to date it is still not completely paid. Regarding the large \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d he sent the creditor a letter, but failed to put the account number on \nthe correspondence. After his hearing he sent another letter, this time with the account \nnumber and offering to settle the debt. I find under the circumstances Applicant did not \nact responsibly toward his debts and has lagged in addressing them. I also find he has \nnot acted in good-faith to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant has had the money to \npay his delinquent debts, but appears to have made other choices rather than paying \nthose he has owed money to for a long time. He had an opportunity to resolve his \nfinancial issues and has not done so. I find mitigating condition (b) only partially applies. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received counseling. Frankly, I am concerned as to \nwhy Applicant has dragged his feet in paying all of his debts. He waited for months to \nresolve his small debts. He waited until days before his hearing to contact the bank \nabout the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He knew his largest debt was a concern; admitted owing it; \nhas the means to pay the lower settlement amount, yet has not completely resolved it. \nInstead he has made a promise to pay it at a later date. I find mitigating conditions (c) \nand (d) do not apply. It appears by Applicant actions he acknowledges the debts in the \nSOR and does not dispute them. I find mitigating condition (e) does not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person who \nexperienced a period of unemployment that impacted his finances. He did not provide \nan accurate accounting of where he was living for a period of five years on his SCA. He \nis an intelligent person and I do not find his explanation for this discrepancy to be \ncredible. Although these matters are not considered for disqualifying purposes, I have \nconsidered them along with his testimony, demeanor and candor when analyzing the \nwhole person. Applicant has been employed for almost three year with his present \nemployer. He is earning a substantial salary. He has sufficient means to satisfy all of his \ndebts. He paid the smaller ones months after his OPM interview. He did not make a \npayment on his largest debt until after his hearing and then only a partial payment and a \npromise to pay the remainder in the future. This debt is years old. I held the record open \nto allow Applicant additional time to address his delinquent debts. I will not speculate as \nto why he continues to delay paying the two largest debts. Clearly Applicant is making \nconscious decisions about his delinquent debts. Under the circumstances I find he has \nnot acted responsibly toward his financial obligations and it is too early to conclude that \nhe will satisfy his remaining delinquent debts. I find Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and\n\nItem 7, State Sexual Offenders and Predators Laws, dated September 16, 2008.  This document includes\n1\nlegislative findings about sexual predators.  \nThe Judge found that Applicant was convicted of committing a lewd and lascivious act with a minor.  Item 6,\n2\nApplicant\u2019s sex offender registry entry, lists his offense as an attempted lewd and lascivious act with a minor.  However,\neven if the Judge erred on this matter, the error is harmless.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case\nNo. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002). \n2\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On March 16, 2009,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a web developer for\na federal contractor.  He has never held a security clearance.\nWhen he was 21 years old, Applicant began chatting on the internet with a female whom he\nbelieved to be 17 or 18 years old.  The on-line conversations became sexually explicit, and soon they\nagreed to meet at the girl\u2019s home.  During the meeting, Applicant discovered that the girl was 13\nyears old.  Nevertheless, he had sexual intercourse with her in her bedroom.  Subsequently, they\nchatted on line about once a month.  They met at a high school football game, walked to a nearby\nwooded area, and had sexual intercourse once again.  The girl\u2019s mother discovered the contents of\nApplicant\u2019s on-line chats and reported Applicant to the sheriff.  Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith \u201ccommitting a lewd and lascivious act in the presence of a child under the age of 16.\u201d  This was\na felony offense.

See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)   In support of his appeal Applicant has submitted new\n2\nevidence, including character references and a copy of the conviction in his case.  The Board cannot\nconsider these documents.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or\nconsidered by the Appeal Board\u201d).

On October 10, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, citing security \nconcerns under Guidelines D and J. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \nMarch 16, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 24, 2008, and requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s written case on December 31, 2008. On January 7, 2009, a complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on January 12, 2009, and he did \nnot submit any additional materials. The case was assigned to me on March 3, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old web developer employed by a federal contractor. He \nhas worked for his current employer since September 2005. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 2005, and has a three-year-old daughter. He has a \nhigh school education and attended a community college for about six months but did \nnot receive a degree or diploma.  \n \n \nDuring the summer of 2000, when Applicant was 21 years old, he began chatting \non the internet with a girl he believed was 17 or 18 years old. Their online conversations \nsoon became sexually explicit. After a short time, they agreed to meet at the girl\u2019s \nhome. During the meeting Applicant discovered that the girl was only 13 years old. \nNevertheless, he had sexual intercourse with her in her bedroom. After this meeting, \nthey chatted only about once a month. In November or December 2000, they met at a \nhigh school football game, walked to a nearby wooded area, and again had sexual \nintercourse. Applicant\u2019s 22nd birthday was on December 3, 2000. In late December \n2000, Applicant attempted to contact the girl and learned that the girl\u2019s mother had \ndiscovered the sexually explicit internet exchanges and notified the local sheriff. \nApplicant was arrested on December 29, 2000, and charged with committing a lewd and \nlascivious act in the presence of a child under the age of 16, a felony. He was jailed \novernight and released on a $10,000 bond (GX 5). \n \n \nIn June 2001, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere and was found guilty. He was \nsentenced to three years of probation, two years of community control, and a fine (GX \n8). He was required to register as a sex offender. He will remain on the registered sex \noffender list until June 2024 (GX 3, 6). \n \n \nThe state law pertaining to registration of sex offenders includes legislative \nfindings that sexual offenders who prey on children are \u201csexual predators,\u201d that they \npresent an \u201cextreme threat to the public safety,\u201d and that they are extremely likely to \nrepeat their offenses (GX 7). \n \n\n \n3\n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant characterized his conduct as \u201ca single \nincident.\u201d He stated that he was \u201csaddened and disgusted\u201d by his actions and he has \ncomplied with all the requirements for registered sex offenders, including therapy \nspecific to his crime. He stated he has committed no crimes since his conviction in June \n2001 and has no intentions of doing so (GX 3). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n4\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was arrested on December 29, 2000, charged with \ncommitting a lewd and lascivious act with a child under the age of 16, pleaded nolo \ncontendere, was convicted, and was sentenced to three years of probation, two years of \ncommunity control, a fine, and court costs (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges he was required \nto register as a sex offender under the state Sexual Predators Act, notify state \nauthorities of his current address every two years, and remain registered as a sex \noffender until at least June 2024 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out AG \u00b6 12, in pertinent part as \nfollows: \u201cSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the \nindividual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d The relevant disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 13(a) (\u201csexual behavior of a \ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted\u201d); AG \u00b6 13(c) \n(\u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or \nduress\u201d); and AG \u00b6 13(d) (\u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment\u201d).  \n \nI conclude that AG \u00b6 13(a) is raised because Applicant\u2019s conduct was a felony \nunder state law. AG \u00b6 13(c) is not raised because Applicant\u2019s conviction and registration \nas a sex offender are public records, removing his vulnerability to threats of disclosure. \nAG \u00b6 13(d) is raised because Applicant\u2019s behavior, while not of a public nature, \nreflected lack of discretion and good judgment. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n\n \n5\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe sexual behavior \nhappened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(b). The first prong of AG \u00b6 14(b) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent.  There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior with the 13-year-old girl ended when he was arrested \nabout eight years ago. Eight years is a \u201csignificant period of time,\u201d raising the question \nwhether that time period demonstrates rehabilitation. I conclude that the eight-year \nperiod without further misconduct is not sufficient to demonstrate rehabilitation, for the \nfollowing reasons.  \n \n \nFirst, Applicant did not engage in a \u201csingle incident\u201d as he asserts in his answer \nto the SOR; it was a six-month course of conduct with two separate incidents of sexual \nintercourse. His attempt to minimize his conduct in his answer militates against a finding \nthat he is rehabilitated. Second, Applicant did not voluntarily terminate his relationship \nwith the girl. It was terminated by his arrest after the girl\u2019s mother reported the sexually \nexplicit email exchanges to the local sheriff. Third, although Applicant refers to his \ntherapy in his answer to the SOR, he has submitted no evidence of the nature or \nduration of the therapy, and there is no evidence of the prognosis for recurrence. \nFourth, as recognized by the state legislature, Applicant\u2019s six-month period of preying \non a 13-year-old girl is a crime for which the recidivism rate is high. Fifth, because \nApplicant requested an administrative determination without a hearing, I have had no \nopportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity.  \n \n \nFinally, Applicant has been under close surveillance during the past eight years, \nfacing severe criminal penalties for any recurrence. The state has determined that he \nshould remain on the register of sex offenders until June 2024. Whether he would \nrepeat his predatory sexual behavior in the absence of close monitoring cannot be \ndetermined from this record. Based on the evidence of record, I conclude that \ninsufficient time has passed to justify a conclusion that Applicant is rehabilitated.  \n \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 14(b) (\u201cso infrequently\u201d) is not established because \nApplicant engaged in a six-month relationship with the 13-year-old girl that included \nfrequent sexually explicit conversations and two acts of sexual intercourse. The third \nprong is not established because Applicant\u2019s conduct did not arise from unusual \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. Finally, his conduct casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 14(b) is not \nestablished. \n \n\n \n6\n \nSecurity concerns arising from sexual behavior also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nbehavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(c). \nThis mitigating condition is established, because the public record of Applicant\u2019s \nconviction and registration as a sex offender eliminates his vulnerability to threats to \ndisclose his behavior. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe sexual \nbehavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(d). Applicant\u2019s behavior \nwas private, but it was not consensual or discreet. The 13-year-old girl was incapable of \nconsent as the term is used under this guideline. Carrying on a sexual relationship with \na 13-year-old girl and engaging in sexual intercourse in her bedroom and in the woods \nnear a football stadium was not discreet behavior.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s arrest, conviction and sentencing \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a under Guideline E. The security concern regarding criminal \nconduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s felony conviction alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nraises the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c) under this guideline. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cso much \ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). For the reasons \nset out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 14(b) under Guideline D, I conclude this \nmitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). \nApplicant expressed sadness and disgust about his behavior in his answer to the SOR, \nwhich is tantamount to remorse. He asserted that he has a good employment record \nand is pursuing several certifications related to his employment, but he has submitted \nno evidence in terms of performance appraisals, diplomas, certificates, or character \nreference letters to establish his good employment record and job training efforts. He \nhas presented no evidence of community involvement. For these reasons as well as the \nreasons set out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 14(b), I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established.  \n\n \n7\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under these guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant was an adult when he commenced his sexual relationship with a 13-\nyear-old girl. He continued the relationship and twice had sexual intercourse with her \neven after learning of her tender age. He did not voluntarily terminate the relationship \nand likely would have continued it for a time if he had not been arrested. He is now 30 \nyears old, married, and the father of a daughter. He has presented no evidence from \nmedical professionals or others to show that he does not fit the state legislature\u2019s \ndescription of sexual predators who prey on children. Whether he would revert to old \nbehavior if released from the constraints of the sex offender registration program cannot \nbe determined. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on sexual behavior and \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Behavior):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that Applicant used marijuana in 2006 and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and with varying frequency from 1985 to 1995 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he told a government investigator in February 2008 that he might use the drug in the future if the opportunity arose (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline J (criminal conduct), Applicant was alleged to have been convicted of drunk driving offenses committed in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and 1991 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and of an open container violation in 1992 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). DOHA also alleged under the criminal conduct guideline that Applicant\u2019s falsification of his e-QIP violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (SOR \u00b6 2.e). Under Guideline E (personal conduct), DOHA alleged that Applicant falsified his October 2007 e-QIP by falsely denying any illegal drug involvement (SOR \u00b6 3.a), and by expressing a belief that marijuana use in moderation was \u201cnot a bad thing\u201d and that smoking marijuana was \u201cnot a big deal\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The government also alleged generally that the conduct under guidelines H and J raised Guideline E concerns as well (SOR \u00b6 3.d). Applicant admitted the drug abuse, and that he had told a government investigator that he might use marijuana in the future.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\n       \nApplicant used marijuana from 1985 to 1995 and in 2006/07. He was convicted\nof drunk driving offenses committed in 1991 and August 2007. He did not report his\nillegal drug abuse when he applied for a security clearance in October 2007. Drug\ninvolvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct concerns are not mitigated.\nClearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on October 17, 2007. On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Guideline J, and Guideline E that provided the\nbasis for its decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\nMay 20, 2009\n\n2\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 16, 2008, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On January 21, 2009, the government submitted a FORM\nconsisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to\nApplicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was\nreceived by the March 4, 2009, due date. On April 15, 2009, the case was assigned to\nme to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for him. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4), eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c of the SOR to\nreflect that Applicant had stated in an interview to a government investigator on\nFebruary 20, 2008, that he might (vice would) use marijuana in the future if the\nopportunity arose. Department Counsel also moved to add a new allegation, \u00b6 2.e under\nGuideline J, to indicate that Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his marijuana use\non his October 17, 2007, security clearance application, conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a,\nconstituted felonious criminal activity under Guideline J. Applicant was directed to file\nany objections and/or to respond within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.\nThere is nothing in Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 that prohibits the\ngovernment from amending the SOR before a hearing or a decision based on the\nwritten record provided the proposed allegations have a reasonable basis, are not\nconfusing, and are relevant to a determination of the applicant\u2019s suitability for access.\nFundamental fairness requires that Applicant be given notice of any proposed\namendment and an adequate opportunity to respond so that he can adequately prepare\na defense (see, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17219 App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2005).\nDepartment Counsel informed Applicant in the FORM of the motion and of his\nopportunity to respond. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on January 22, 2009,\nwith clear instructions to file any objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received\nthe FORM on February 2, 2009. No response was received by the March 4, 2009, due\ndate. Given Applicant had been placed on notice and had an adequate opportunity to\nrespond, I notified the parties by Order of May 6, 2009, that the SOR was amended per\nthe government\u2019s request, and that findings would be made on all allegations in the\nSOR, as amended, based on the Items in the FORM.\n\nApplicant indicated on his October 17, 2007, e-QIP that he had been the subject of a background\n1\ninvestigation in August 2005 but was unaware of any final action on his clearance (Item 5). Available\ninformation does not confirm or deny the grant of a clearance.\n3\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that\nApplicant used marijuana in 2006 and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and with varying frequency\nfrom 1985 to 1995 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he told a government investigator in February\n2008 that he might use the drug in the future if the opportunity arose (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under\nGuideline J (criminal conduct), Applicant was alleged to have been convicted of drunk\ndriving offenses committed in August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and 1991 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and of\nan open container violation in 1992 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). DOHA also alleged under the criminal\nconduct guideline that Applicant\u2019s falsification of his e-QIP violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n(SOR \u00b6 2.e). Under Guideline E (personal conduct), DOHA alleged that Applicant\nfalsified his October 2007 e-QIP by falsely denying any illegal drug involvement (SOR \u00b6\n3.a), and by expressing a belief that marijuana use in moderation was \u201cnot a bad thing\u201d\nand that smoking marijuana was \u201cnot a big deal\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The government also\nalleged generally that the conduct under guidelines H and J raised Guideline E\nconcerns as well (SOR \u00b6 3.d). Applicant admitted the drug abuse, and that he had told a\ngovernment investigator that he might use marijuana in the future. However, he added\nthat he would not use marijuana after he was married, that he wished he never started\nit, and that it would not be part of his future. His fianc\u00e9e had never used marijuana, and\ndrug use was not part of the life they wanted to impart to their children. Applicant also\nadmitted his alcohol-related criminal conduct, but averred that he had attended a\nsubstance abuse program and stopped the abusive behavior. Applicant explained he\nhad not listed his drug use on his e-QIP because he was embarrassed. Applicant\noffered in mitigation his \u201cimpeccable work record\u201d as a contractor for a Department of\nDefense agency since 1996.\nDOHA had alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified a May 15, 1998,\nQuestionnaire for Public Trust (SF 85P) by not disclosing his marijuana use that had\noccurred within seven years of the application (SOR \u00b6 3.b). While Applicant admitted he\nhad not disclosed his marijuana use from his first clearance submission, DOHA\nconceded in the FORM that the question Applicant was alleged to have falsified on the\nSF 85P only had a one-year scope, and the available evidence did not support the\nallegation.\nAfter review and consideration of the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s SOR response\n(Item 4), I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior operations security engineer, who under the\nemploy of a succession of defense contractors, has directly serviced a DoD agency\nsince 1996 (Items 4, 5). Applicant has been a key member of the DoD agency\u2019s\ncomputer network security team since 1999 (Item 4), and he seeks a security\nclearance.1\n\nThe pertinent state punishes operating while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (abbreviated OVI\n2\nin the statute) under the state's motor vehicle statutes, but it is punishable as a criminal offense. See Ohio\nRev. Code Ann. \u00a7 4511.19.\n4\nApplicant began to smoke marijuana at age 15. He continued to use marijuana\nover the next ten years with varying frequency, including while he was in college from\nAugust 1988 to March 1994 (Items 5, 6, 7). There were times of heavy use for two\nmonths followed by abstinence for six months or so. Applicant purchased at least some\nof the marijuana from one of his brother's friends (Item 6). In about 1991, Applicant\npleaded no contest to a driving under the influence (DUI) charge (Items 4, 7). In 1992,\nhe was cited for having an open container in his motor vehicle (Item 4).\nTwo months after he was awarded his B.S. degree, Applicant started working as\na computer network engineer (Item 5). Placed at a defense contractor agency starting in\nabout October 1996, Applicant completed a SF 85P on May 15, 1998. He listed his DUI\noffense in response to the police record inquiries. He answered \"No\" to the illegal drug\ninquiries, including 21.a. \"In the last year, have  you illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium,\nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \ntec.), \namphetamines, \ndepressants \n(barbiturates,\nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription\ndrugs?\" (Item 7).\nApplicant was passed some marijuana at a friend's halloween party in the fall of\n2006. Intoxicated at the time, Applicant believes he smoked the drug with the person\nwho provided it. As of the summer of 2007, Applicant played volleyball on a weekly\nbasis. He drank and partied with teammates after the games. On one occasion that\nsummer, he smoked marijuana given to him by a teammate. Applicant was drunk at the\ntime (Item 6).\nIn mid-August 2007, Applicant was giving a volleyball teammate a ride home\nwhen he was pulled over for speeding. Applicant, who indicates he had consumed \"a\nfew beers,\" after his game, was charged with operating vehicle under the influence of\nalcohol or drugs (OVI), a first degree misdemeanor.  He pleaded no contest to the OVI\n2\ncharge in court in early September 2007, was found guilty, and sentenced to a $750\nfine, $305 in costs, 180 days in jail (173 suspended), and his license was ordered\nsuspended for six months with special conditions:  limited driving privileges, five days in\na work program in lieu of four days jail time, a driving awareness class, a prohibition of\nalcohol use, and 12-month probation.  The speeding charge was dismissed. (Items 5, 6,\n8)\nOn October 17, 2007, Applicant completed an e-QIP for a security clearance for\nhis duties at the defense agency. He responded \"Yes\" to questions 23c. \"Are there\ncurrently any charges pending against you for any criminal offense?\" and 23d. \"Have\nyou ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?.\"\nHe disclosed his recent OVI in August 2007 and indicated that he had pleaded no\ncontest, paid fines, was attending a driver intervention program, making a donation to a\n\nIt is not apparent in the available record how the investigator came to learn of Applicant's more recent\n3\nmarijuana use.\n5\npublic library, and attending a MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) meeting.\nApplicant responded \"No\" to question 24a. \"Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example,\nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium), morphine, codeine,\nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers,\netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\" (Item 5).\nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in\npart about his drinking and the recent drunk driving offense. He admitted the OVI and\nthat his parents and his employer were unaware of the offense, although his girlfriend\nknew about it. He did not want to burden his parents, including his father, who was very\nill. Applicant explained his current drinking pattern as two or three beers once or twice\nper week when out with friends. Applicant denied using any illegal drugs in the last\nseven years or while holding a security clearance (Item 6).\nApplicant was reinterviewed on February 20, 2008, to discuss his previously\nundisclosed marijuana use. After Applicant was placed under oath, he was again asked\nwhether he had used any illegal drugs in the last seven years and whether he used any\nillegal drugs while possessing a security clearance. After reportedly some hesitation,\nApplicant related that he had used marijuana from ages 15 to 25. He was not specific\nabout the frequency other than to indicate that he would use it heavily for two months\nand then not use for six months. Applicant acknowledged that the marijuana was\npurchased from a friend of his brother. After being confronted about possible use of\nmarijuana in the fall of 2006,  Applicant indicated he might have used it, but he did not\n3\nremember. He then expressed his belief that he may have smoked it while drunk at a\nfriend's halloween party in fall 2006. Asked about any other occasions, Applicant\nresponded that he smoked marijuana one other time in the summer of 2007 while\nsocializing with teammates after their weekly volleyball game. A teammate who is\nalways at the bar had some marijuana, and Applicant explained that he was drunk and\ndecided to smoke it. He told the investigator that he did not think smoking marijuana\nwas a big deal, and that while he does not seek out marijuana, he would sometimes use\nit if he is drunk at a party.  Applicant added that he might use marijuana again at a party\nif the opportunity arose, and that he did not consider marijuana use in moderation to be\na bad thing. He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use was against the law, and\nthat his employer was unaware of his drug use. Applicant denied any intent to use\nmarijuana to the extent he did when he was younger because he would lose his\ngirlfriend if he did so. Applicant attributed the omission of his marijuana use from his\nsecurity clearance application to embarrassment (Item 6).\nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e are planning to wed in 2010. Applicant does not see\nmarijuana playing a part in his future. His fianc\u00e9e does not use marijuana and they\nintend to have children together. Applicant attributes his alcohol abuse to the mental\nstrain of having to care for his 78-year-old father who has had Parkinson's disease since\n\n6\n2000. Applicant completed a county substance abuse program that led him to realize he\nhad been drinking too much and he had since stopped the behavior.  As of mid-\nDecember 2008, Applicant was helping care for his father two to three nights per week\n(Item 4).\nApplicant has not allowed his off-duty abuse of alcohol and marijuana to\nnegatively affect his work performance. Since 1999, he has been a key member of the\ndefense agency's network security team responsible for firewalls, encryption devices,\nand security enclaves to protect its computer system from hackers. He is recognized by\nhis defense agency customer as its top expert in operations security. Applicant has\nbeen responsible for several high profile projects during the 13 years and he has earned\nthe trust of the division's operations manager. Applicant was recognized by the defense\nagency's technology services organization for his \"outstanding and commendable\nperformance\" during a security accreditation of the defense agency's computer network\nin fall 2008 (Item 4).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nwhich are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n7\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Applicant began using marijuana at age 15. Over the next ten years, he\nsmoked the drug with varying frequency, to include months of heavy use. After more\nthan ten years of no apparent involvement, he smoked marijuana at a halloween party\nin fall 2006 and then again in summer 2007 when socializing with volleyball teammates\nat a local bar. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies. Applicant purchased the drug for\nhis own consumption back when he was using it with some frequency, so AG \u00b6 25(c),\n\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,\nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d is also implicated.\nDuring his February 2008 subject interview, Applicant told a government\ninvestigator that he might use marijuana in the future at a party if the opportunity arose.\nSecurity concerns are raised by an \"expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or\nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use\" (see AG \u00b6 25(h)).\nApplicant was not willing to commit himself to a drug-free lifestyle at that time. In\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant claimed he told the investigator that he would not use\nmarijuana after he was married, although the investigator's report does not reflect any\nexpression of intent on his part to discontinue use. However, Applicant added in his\nAnswer, \"My marijuana use is something I wish I would never have started and will not\n\n8\nbe part of my future.\" (Item 4).  His recent disavowal of any intent to use marijuana in\nthe future is accepted as credible, so AG \u00b6 25(h) no longer applies.\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation under Guideline H, Applicant\u2019s recent\ninvolvement with marijuana was \"so infrequent\u201d to fall within AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d However, AG \u00b6 26(a) cannot reasonably be applied,\ngiven his more extensive marijuana involvement from 1985 to 1995. It is especially\ntroubling that Applicant used marijuana at least twice over the 2006/07 time frame after\nno apparent involvement for more than 10 years.\nAG 26(b), \"a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\" applies\nonly in very limited part (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \"a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation\"). His decision to forego future drug\ninvolvement is sincere but very recent. Applicant has not shown that he no longer\nassociates with drug users (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \"disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts\"), or that he is avoiding the social activities that led him to\nabuse marijuana in 2006 and 2007 (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \"\"changing or avoiding the\nenvironments where drugs were used\"). His present abstinence (see AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \"an\nappropriate period of abstinence\") since summer 2007 is insufficient to guarantee\nagainst recurrence, given his history of relapses in 2006/07 after no use since 1995. He\nhas not overcome the risk that he will again use marijuana with friends, especially if he\nis intoxicated as he was in 2006 and 2007.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern about criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d The government did not present any evidence to show that the\nopen container offense was other than a minor violation. However, his drunk driving\nconvictions, although misdemeanors, clearly implicate AG \u00b6 31(a), \"a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.\" Applicant also used marijuana knowing that it was\nagainst the law to do so. Furthermore, by signing his October 2007 e-QIP, Applicant\ncertified his statements on the form were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his]\nknowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith.\u201d He was on notice that a knowing\nand willful false statement was punishable as a crime. His deliberate omission of his\nmarijuana use from his e-QIP constituted a felony violation of federal law under 18\nU.S.C. \u00a71001. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted,\nor convicted,\u201d also applies. \nAG \u00b6 32(a), \"so much times has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\" cannot\n\n9\nreasonably be applied in this case. It has been less than two years since he last used\nmarijuana, was caught driving while under the influence of alcohol, and falsified his e-\nQIP.\nIn Applicant's favor, he has a record of significant contributions to a defense\nagency (see AG \u00b6 32(d), \"there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement\"). Yet, he clearly was not thinking of his obligations to the\ngovernment when he abused marijuana, operated a motor vehicle while under the\ninfluence, and lied on his e-QIP.  In response to the SOR, he indicated that after his\nrecent OVI offense, he completed a substance abuse program offered by the county\nand had stopped his abusive behavior. He excused his behavior in part, attributing it to\nthe mental strain of caring for his ill father. However, the evidence implicates instead his\npartying and socializing with volleyball teammates, and Applicant has not demonstrated\na sufficient change in those activities. Furthermore, municipal court records show that\none condition of his sentence for the OVI was \u201cno alcohol.\u201d He was still on probation for\nthe OVI when he was interviewed in January 2008 about his alcohol consumption, and\nhe detailed drinking two or three beers once or twice a week when out with friends. His\napparent failure to abide by an order of the court undermines his claimed reform as to\nhis drunk driving. As for his falsification, Applicant did not correct the record during his\nJanuary 2008 interview. Instead, he denied any illegal drug use in the last seven years.\nDuring his February 2008 interview, he was not forthcoming initially about his recent\nmarijuana use. While there is no indication of any ongoing alcohol or marijuana abuse,\nor that he is still concealing relevant and material drug abuse from the government,\nreform is not fully demonstrated where Applicant had to be confronted.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant's falsification of his October 2007 e-QIP raises personal conduct\nconcerns as well as criminal conduct concerns. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. However, as\nconceded by the government, the evidence does not establish that Applicant falsified\nhis SF 85P completed in May 1998. While Applicant responded \"No\" to any illegal drug\n\n10\nuse, the specific question at issue had only a one-year scope, and there is no evidence\nthat Applicant smoked marijuana (or used any other illegal drug) after 1995 until 2006.\nAlthough Applicant indicates that those persons who really know him, including\nhis fianc\u00e9e, are knowledgeable of his past drug involvement, his defense contractor\nemployer is unaware. Furthermore, there is nothing in the operations manager's\nreference letter (Item 4) to indicate that he or anyone else from the defense agency  is\ncognizant of the fact that Applicant used marijuana (albeit off-duty) while a member of\nthe agency's network security team. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201dpersonal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing,\u201d is also implicated despite\nhis denials of susceptibility to blackmail.\nDOHA alleged separately under SOR \u00b6 3.c that Applicant exercised poor\njudgment within the context of Guideline E by expressing to a government investigator\nin February 2008 that use of marijuana in moderation was not a bad thing, and that\nsmoking marijuana was not a big deal. Applicant explained his comments as follows:  \"I\nwas candidly speaking from experience on the effects of marijuana use and how if used\nonce is not detrimental but prolonged use will cause problems.\" Whether or not he was\nspeaking of the effects of marijuana, it would be reasonable to infer that he condoned\nthe use of marijuana despite knowing of its illegality. While it raises general personal\nconduct concerns under AG \u00b6 15, the conduct is more appropriately addressed under\nGuideline H.\nSimilarly, Applicant unquestionably exercised poor judgment by driving drunk and\nusing marijuana in violation of the law. Since his substance abuse is already covered\nunder Guideline J (and in the case of drug use Guideline H as well), the government\nfailed to establish its case for application of AG \u00b6 16(c), \"credible adverse information in\nseveral adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under\nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\"\nFor the reasons set forth under Guideline J, supra, none of the mitigating\nconditions under Guideline E fully apply. He made no effort to rectify his falsification at\nhis first opportunity when he was interviewed in January 2008. Instead, he apparently\nagain denied any illegal drug involvement in the preceding seven years. That conduct\ncould have been alleged in its own right under AG \u00b6 16(b), \"deliberately providing false\nor misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment\nrepresentative.\"  AG \u00b6 17(a), \"the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct\nthe omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts\" does\nnot apply to these facts. His record of security significant misconduct in three distinct\nareas (drugs, drunk driving, felony false statement) is too recent and repeated to qualify\n\n11\nfor mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c), \"the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed,\nor the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\" AG \u00b6 17(d), \"the individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\" cannot be completely\ndismissed because Applicant has resolved not to repeat his mistakes. But Applicant has\nyet to establish a sufficient track record of reform to overcome all the personal conduct\nconcerns in this case. As recently as February 2008, he exhibited an attitude toward\nmarijuana use that is inconsistent with the law and the sensitive position he held at\nwork. He admitted prior drug use only reluctantly after repeated inquiries, and\naddressed his reform of his drunk driving only in the most general terms. Finally, he has\ndone little to reduce or eliminate the risk of exploitation, manipulation, or duress that\nexists because his employer remains unaware of the conduct that calls into question\nApplicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 17(e), \"the individual has\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress,\" does not apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my\ncomments under Guideline H, Guideline J, and Guideline E in my whole-person\nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but\nsome warrant additional comment.\nApplicant knew when he used marijuana that it was illegal. He put his personal\ninterest ahead of his obligation of candor. He deliberately falsified his e-QIP, which he\nnow regrets, but compounded the concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness by\nnot candidly disclosing his drug abuse when he was first interviewed in January 2008. In\n\n12\nFebruary 2008, he displayed an attitude toward marijuana use that is unacceptable in\nsomeone his age and holding a sensitive position. Now knowing that it could cost him\nhis clearance, he maintains that marijuana will no longer play a part in his future, but\nthat is not sufficient to overcome the credible adverse information in this case.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline J (criminal conduct) that Applicant was charged on March 3, 2006, with four felony counts of embezzlement over $100, and that on or about February 13, 2008, he pleaded nolo contendere to one count and was sentenced to pay restitution and to 20 years probation. Applicant admitted the charge and sentence and explained that heirs of an estate for which he was an executor felt he was not justified in investing estate funds into his own software company. A f t e r consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 59-year-old computer programmer who has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2004 (Ex. 1). He seeks a secret-level security clearance for his duties (Tr. 5). Applicant married in October 1971. He completed one year of college at a prestigious university in the U.S. in June 1974, and in February 1979, he started his own computer software consulting company, developing custom software for banks and brokerage firms (Tr. 53). He and his spouse held the company jointly and were the sole stockholders (Tr. 47). Applicant employed contract programmers that came and went, and he employed his brother-in-law at one point, but he had no regular full-time employees that worked for him (Tr. 47).

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nWhile serving as the executor of an estate, he illegally invested assets of the\nestate into his own software company. He is on probation until 2028 after pleading nolo\ncontendere to felony embezzlement. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on January 22,\n2004. On November 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern under\nGuideline J that provided the basis for its action to deny him a security clearance and\nrefer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nApril 28, 2009\n\n2\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 17, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January\n6, 2009. On January 29, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for February 19, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence, on\nthe government\u2019s motion, and with no objection from Applicant, SOR \u00b6 1.a was\namended to allege that Applicant was charged with four counts of felony embezzlement\non March 3, 2006. The government submitted five exhibits (Ex. 1-5) which were\nadmitted into evidence. Applicant objected to Exhibit 5, a court docket report, as it did\nnot reflect the dismissal of the criminal case. His objection was overruled and the\ndocument accepted to reflect the case status as of the date of the report. Three\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted without any objections, including as Exhibit C\nthe disposition of the case proceedings reported in Exhibit 5. Applicant also testified, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 3, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline J (criminal conduct) that\nApplicant was charged on March 3, 2006, with four felony counts of embezzlement over\n$100, and that on or about February 13, 2008, he pleaded nolo contendere to one count\nand was sentenced to pay restitution and to 20 years probation. Applicant admitted the\ncharge and sentence and explained that heirs of an estate for which he was an executor\nfelt he was not justified in investing estate funds into his own software company. A f t e r\nconsideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 59-year-old computer programmer who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since January 2004 (Ex. 1). He seeks a secret-level security\nclearance for his duties (Tr. 5).\nApplicant married in October 1971. He completed one year of college at a\nprestigious university in the U.S. in June 1974, and in February 1979, he started his\nown computer software consulting company, developing custom software for banks and\nbrokerage firms (Tr. 53). He and his spouse held the company jointly and were the sole\nstockholders (Tr. 47). Applicant employed contract programmers that came and went,\nand he employed his brother-in-law at one point, but he had no regular full-time\nemployees that worked for him (Tr. 47). The business provided sufficient income for\nApplicant to support his spouse, their five children born during the 1987 to 1998 time\nframe (Ex. 1), and apparently also her mother (Tr. 61).\nIn January 1999, a cousin of his by marriage died (Tr. 54). Applicant had a close\nrelationship with this cousin (\u201che and I were like brothers,\u201d Tr. 32). Under the terms of\nthe will, Applicant was named the executor of his estate, which exceeded $1 million in\n\nApplicant estimated that he invested between $200,000 and $400,000 in his computer consulting\n1\nbusiness (Ex. 2). The court ordered him to pay restitution of $398,000 (Tr. 38), a figure that was arrived at by\nreviewing the estate\u2019s books (Tr. 48). W hile some of the funds may well be for legitimate expenses in traveling\nto France for example, the amount misappropriated is closer to $400,000 than $200,000.\nAs to when he began to write checks from the estate\u2019s money market fund to his company, Applicant\n2\ntestified he had definitely done so by 2000. He did not believe he had written any before 2000, but also\ntestified that he was charged with four counts of embezzlement, one for each year that he had diverted the\nestate\u2019s assets to his business (Tr. 54).\n3\nvalue and included a trust as well as an apartment property in France that would have\nto be sold and the proceeds distributed to his cousin\u2019s heirs (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 30, 45). That\nApril, Applicant traveled to France to clean out the apartment (Ex. 1, Tr. 54). He initially\ndisbursed \u201ca considerable amount\u201d of bank stock assets to the heirs (Tr. 29), but held\nthe estate\u2019s money market assets to pay taxes and maintenance fees and other\nnecessary expenses associated with the foreign property (Tr. 53-54). Applicant was not\nhimself a beneficiary of the estate but his children and spouse were heirs (Tr. 34).\nApplicant read the will as giving him the power to invest estate assets as he saw\nfit (Tr. 33). His computer consulting business was doing well at that time, and Applicant\nbegan in 1999 to invest estate funds in his own company with the intent of increasing\nthe value of the estate for its heirs (Ex. 2, Tr. 28-29), and because he was not certain of\nthe costs associated with the maintenance and sale of the foreign property (Tr. 57).\nFrom about late 1999 through 2002, Applicant took almost $400,000  out of the estate\n1\n(primarily money market account funds) and invested it in his business (Ex. 2, Tr. 31,\n45).  Profits from his consulting business were not repaid to the estate. Rather, they\n2\nwent toward the next contract, and toward soliciting more work for his company (Tr. 64).\nApplicant\u2019s software business suffered a significant downturn in the 2001/02 time frame,\nand funds were diverted from the estate in an effort to keep his software consulting\nbusiness afloat. He wrote checks from the estate directly for the health insurance\nprovided as a company benefit (Tr. 33, 46), paid wages with some of the funds (Ex. 2),\nand some business travel expenses (Tr. 62). Applicant did not inform the beneficiaries,\nincluding his spouse, that he had diverted assets of the estate to his business (Tr. 32,\n49), and he did not seek any legal advice about the propriety of his conduct (Tr. 33-34).\nHe did not see a need to inform the heirs and there was no directive that required it (Tr.\n34).\nApplicant closed down his software business in January 2003 (Tr. 35). Realizing\nthat he had made poor investment decisions and that he would be unable to repay the\nestate, Applicant became seriously depressed. Facing an audit of the estate by its\nattorney at the request of the probate court because the estate had been in probate for\na longer period than normal (Tr. 46, 57), he attempted suicide twice in 2002, and again\nin January 2003 (Ex. 2, Tr. 46). He voluntarily admitted himself to a mental health\ntreatment facility for the month of February 2003, where he received inpatient treatment\nfor severe depression (Ex. 2). Applicant has been under the care of his treating\npsychiatrist since his hospitalization (Ex. 2, Ex. C).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s misappropriation of estate assets was discovered during an audit of\nthe estate in 2003. A civil suit was filed to have him removed as executor. The case was\ndropped when Applicant resigned voluntarily, and a new executor was appointed (Ex.\n2).\nIn late April 2003, Applicant went to work as a programmer/analyst for a\ncompany. In June 2003, Applicant and his spouse divorced, and he was ordered to pay\nchild support for his five children. He quit his job in late July 2003, because it was not\nsuited to his training. In September 2003, he became employed as a desktop support\nspecialist for a local school system, but he resigned at the request of the school\ndepartment in early November 2003. He held a second job as a sales consultant with an\nelectronics retailer for about a month before he lost his job at the school, and remained\nat that job until January 2004. He also worked part-time in 2003 as an adjunct professor\nat a community college, and as a crew trainer at a restaurant (Ex. 1).\nAfter commencing employment with the defense contractor in January 2004,\nApplicant continued to work a second job. He gave his entire check from his defense\ncontractor employment to his ex-wife (about $900 a week) for her and the children\nbecause he felt bad about what he had done. He supported himself on the income from\nhis second job (Tr. 60).\nIn early September 2005, his ex-wife and her two sisters, all heirs to their\ncousin\u2019s estate, filed a complaint with the police about his handling of the estate. On the\nadvice of the state police, Applicant turned himself in and he was released on personal\nrecognizance. On March 3, 2006, he was formally charged with four counts of felony\nembezzlement over $100 (Exs. 2, 3), and in April 2006, his case was transferred to\nsuperior court (Ex. 3). Applicant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in June 2006.\nPursuant to a plea bargain, he retracted his not guilty plea and pleaded nolo contendere\nin February 2008 to one count of felony embezzlement over $100. He was convicted\nand sentenced to 20 years in prison, suspended, and placed on 20 years probation. He\nwas also ordered to pay restitution of $398,000, $75,000 in a lump sum followed by\n$300 per week for the next 20 years (Exs. 2, 4, Tr. 38). Applicant obtained advances of\n$50,000 from his mother and $25,000 from a close friend to cover the $75,000 lump\nsum payment. His friend also paid his legal expenses for him. Applicant has continued\nto make his $300 weekly restitution payments from his employment income (Tr. 55-56).\nIn November 2007, Applicant reduced the amount of money sent to his ex-wife to\ncover only what he is required to pay in court-ordered child support (Tr. 60), which has\ncaused some custody issues with his spouse. He is seeking joint custody of his children\n(Tr. 30). The amount of his restitution is under court review because his spouse had\nalready benefitted from the estate (Exs. 2, 4, Tr. 48). Applicant plans to show the court\nin a deposition that his restitution should be reduced by one-third and that he has\nalready paid his ex-wife well over $100,000 (Tr. 48, 60).\nOn December 9, 2008, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor simple\nassault/domestic after he shook his fiance\u00e9 during an argument (Ex. 5, Tr. 39). Since he\n\n5\nwas on probation for the felony embezzlement, he was held in jail for one week. He\nadmitted to violating his probation (Tr. 40), and a no contact order was issued before he\nwas released (Ex. 4). On January 6, 2009, the no contact order was rescinded and the\nsimple assault charge was dismissed. His probation for the felony offense was not\nrevoked (Ex. A, Tr. 39-41). Applicant informed his manager at work about his felony\nembezzlement and domestic assault offenses (Tr. 42).\nApplicant does not have the same financial pressures that contributed to his\ndiversion of estate funds to his personal business. His previously had a jumbo mortgage\nwith monthly payments close to $3,000 (Tr. 51). He currently has a $46,000 mortgage\nfor a mobile home (Tr. 56). He is paying child support for three minor children, and as of\nMay 2009, will be paying for two of his children (Tr. 28).\nApplicant works directly with a government project engineer on a daily basis.\nDuring 2008, he met and occasionally exceeded his employer\u2019s expectations (Ex. B).\nApplicant has been compliant with his treatment for his depression. His treating\npsychiatrist sees no reason why Applicant should be denied full visitation or shared\ncustody of his children (Ex. C). For the past year, Applicant has been teaching\ncomputer classes twice weekly for senior citizens (Tr. 30).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nwhich are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern about criminal conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nIn February 2008, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere and was convicted of one\ncount of felony embezzlement for diverting about $398,000 in assets of a deceased\nrelative\u2019s estate to his personal business. A review of the estate\u2019s books showed that\nhis criminal conduct spanned four years, from 1999 through 2002. AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply. Since he is on probation for the offense until 2028, AG\n\u00b6 31(d), \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation,\u201d is also implicated. Furthermore,\nhe admitted that a simple assault of his fiance\u00e9 in December 2008 was in violation of his\nprobation. So, even though the assault charge was dismissed, and his probation was\nnot revoked, his violation of a condition of a probation\u2014that he remains on good\n\n7\nbehavior\u2014implicates AG \u00b6 31(e), \u201cviolation of parole or probation, or failure to complete\na court-mandated rehabilitation program.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is too egregious and recent to apply mitigating\ncondition AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Any\nviolation of fiduciary obligations, such as an executor has to the heirs of an estate,\nraises considerable judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthe person was pressured or\ncoerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the\nperson\u2019s life,\u201d is not persuasive. His financial situation has improved since he diverted\nthe estate funds to his business. His company ceased operations in January 2003, he\nno longer has a high mortgage payment, and pays child support for only three children\nat this point. As of May 2009, only two of his children will be eligible for support\npayments. Yet, to apply AG \u00b6 32(b), I would have to ignore the knowing and voluntary\nnature of his criminal conduct and that it began even before his business downturn. \nAG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement,\u201d applies in only very limited part. Applicant has a good work\nrecord with his present employer, as reflected in his annual performance appraisal for\n2008 (Ex. B). He also teaches computer classes to senior citizens. But it would be\npremature to conclude that he is successfully rehabilitated. His current probationary\nstatus is not an automatic bar to a security clearance, but he has served only one year\nof a 20-year term. Furthermore, his first year of probation was not without incident, as\nevidenced by the simple assault of his fiance\u00e9. Applicant maintains that he is a different\nperson now than he was five years ago (Tr. 51), but despite the criminal charges and\nhis conviction on one count of felony embezzlement, he continues to believe that he had\nbroad investment powers (\u201cI maintain it even until today, my reading of the will said I\ncould basically do and invest and use my judgment to invest the money.\u201d Tr. 33). When\nasked to comment about his failure to appreciate his ethical obligation as executor,\nApplicant responded, \u201cI also appreciated the obligation I had to five children, a wife, a\nmother-in-law, a mortgage that was too high for us\u201d (Tr. 51). Even if Applicant did not\nmean to suggest that his misappropriation of estate funds was justified because of the\nneeds of his family, it raises doubts about whether he fully accepts responsibility for his\ncriminal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s judgment is called into serious question because of his\nembezzlement of about $398,000 in estate funds when he served as executor of a\nfamily member\u2019s estate. He was sentenced for his felonious conduct to 20 years in\nprison, suspended, and 20 years of probation with restitution. While he has been\nmaking his restitution payments, initially with the help of his mother and a close friend,\nhe has yet to demonstrate the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that must be\ndemanded of those persons granted access to classified information.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a NASA contractor. He is married, with three children, ages 14, 12, and 5. He has been continuously employed in his present capacity since 1996. He has no military service, but has held a security clearance since 1997. In his response to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 4 1.i, and admitted the truth of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.j. Applicant\u2019s admissions, 5 including those contained in his response to interrogatories, are incorporated in the 6 following findings. The two SOR allegations that Applicant denied were true, in that the debts were collection accounts, totaling $1,607, that had not been paid as of July 14, 2007. He provided proof that he settled these two accounts, for total payments of $886 in March 2008, with his response to DOHA interrogatories. Accordingly, these debts are now 7 resolved. The eight delinquent debts to which Applicant admitted in his SOR response totaled $25,039. In his response to the FORM, he supplied proof that he fully paid five of these debts, totaling $3,038, for $3,441 including additional late fees and interest, during March 2009. These resolved debts were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j. He did not identify the source of the funds used to pay these debts, but had stated in his SOR response that he intended to use his income tax refund for debt payment.

A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non March 31, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He timely submitted additional material\nconcerning repayments toward his debts, and made no objection to consideration of any\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel, in an undated letter mailed on April 27,\n2009 and received by DOHA on April 29, 2009. The following day, Department Counsel\nindicated that she did not object to the admissibility into evidence of anything submitted\nby Applicant. I received the case assignment on May 11, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a NASA contractor. He is married, with\nthree children, ages 14, 12, and 5. He has been continuously employed in his present\ncapacity since 1996. He has no military service, but has held a security clearance since\n1997.  In his response to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and\n4\n1.i, and admitted the truth of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.j.  Applicant\u2019s admissions,\n5\nincluding those contained in his response to interrogatories,  are incorporated in the\n6\nfollowing findings.\nThe two SOR allegations that Applicant denied were true, in that the debts were\ncollection accounts, totaling $1,607, that had not been paid as of July 14, 2007. He\nprovided proof that he settled these two accounts, for total payments of $886 in March\n2008, with his response to DOHA interrogatories.  Accordingly, these debts are now\n7\nresolved. The eight delinquent debts to which Applicant admitted in his SOR response\ntotaled $25,039. In his response to the FORM, he supplied proof that he fully paid five of\nthese debts, totaling $3,038, for $3,441 including additional late fees and interest,\nduring March 2009. These resolved debts were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and\n1.j. He did not identify the source of the funds used to pay these debts, but had stated in\nhis SOR response that he intended to use his income tax refund for debt payment.\n\nId.\n8\nItems 7, 8.\n9\n3\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant also provided proof that he initiated\nrepayment plans with the creditors holding his three remaining delinquent debts. These\ntotaled $22,001, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. The first involves a student loan\nof $6,033 toward which he made $63 monthly payments in February, March, and April\n2009, bringing its status to \u201cIn Repayment, current.\u201d The second involved a past-due\nloan toward which he paid $500 in March 2009, bringing the balance due to $650, and\nmade the first agreed $100 monthly payment in April 2009. He anticipates resolving this\ndebt by August 2009. The final debt of $15,203, involved a repossession after default on\na car loan. Applicant said he has entered a repayment plan for this debt, and\ndocumented one payment of $300 to the creditor on April 24, 2009. \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement indicated monthly income of $2,275,\nwith expenses of $1,672, and a mortgage payment of $550. This left a remainder of $53\nper month for other debt payments, including a $60 monthly payment due on a credit\nunion loan that was not delinquent. He indicated that he made up the monthly shortfall\nwith help from income tax refunds, withdrawal from a 401k emergency fund, and\nassistance from his relatives. Applicant said his delinquencies arose because his wife\nhad to stop working in 2005 to care for their children, and now has to provide assistance\nto his brother, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2007.  However, credit reports\n8\nindicate a pattern of delinquencies arising regularly since at least 2001.   \n9\nApplicant offered no evidence of credit or financial counseling. He offered no\nother evidence concerning his character, trustworthiness or responsibility. I was unable\nto evaluate his credibility, demeanor or character in person since he elected to have his\ncase decided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d are potentially disqualifying. Department Counsel cited\nonly the former condition in her argument, but both are supported on this record.\nApplicant resolved a number of his smaller delinquencies, and began payments toward\nhis larger debts, using his recent income tax refund. However, his budget reflects only\n\n5\n$53 available monthly to put toward debt repayment, including $63 toward his student\nloan, $100 toward the SOR \u00b6 1.d loan, $60 toward his credit union loan, and $300\ntoward the repossessed auto loan. He did not demonstrate the ability to pay these debts\ngoing forward, and has a lengthy history of not meeting his financial obligations. The\nevidence supporting these disqualifying conditions requires a closer examination and\nbalancing of resulting security concerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and\nshifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility is both long-standing and continues to date. He remains substantially in\ndebt and his current financial situation precludes a finding that delinquent indebtedness\nis unlikely to recur. The evidence does not support application of this potentially\nmitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant did not\ndemonstrate that any of his delinquent debt arose from circumstances that were beyond\nhis control. Although his wife decided to stop working and his brother became ill, he did\nnot show that the debts were unavoidable or caused by anything other than spending\nmore than he earned. Applicant has not established mitigation of any of his debts under\nthis provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d There is no evidence of financial counseling, but some\nmitigation under these provisions was established by his recent and commendable\nefforts to resolve his delinquencies. However, the record is devoid of evidence\nsupporting his ability to follow through on repayment of more than $20,000 in\noutstanding debts, and insufficient time or responsible performance has occurred to\ndate to alleviate the substantial security concerns raised by the length and degree of\nfinancial irresponsibility that continues in part to date. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He presently has at least $21,000 in  debt,\nand did not meet his burden to prove an ongoing ability to repay it. None of his debt was\nshown to have arisen for reasons beyond his control. His actions in repaying some\ndebts were commendable, but insufficient on balance to support a finding that such\nfinancial irresponsibility will not recur. His debts continue to create substantial potential\nfor pressure, coercion, or duress. The record contains insufficient other evidence about\nhis character or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to make their\ncontinuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of not meeting\nhis financial obligations and inability to satisfy his current debts. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 1973 to at least\nAugust 2007, including while he held a security clearance, and he was diagnosed with\nmarijuana dependence. He deliberately omitted his marijuana involvement from\nsecurity clearance applications completed in January 2000 and August 2007 and during\nin-person interviews in October and November 2007. He also misrepresented the extent\nof his abuse in his June 2008 response to interrogatories. Drug abuse and personal\nconduct concerns are not fully mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 14, 2007. On November 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\naction to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge.\nJune 3, 2009  \n\nDOHA misquoted the question in the SOR to allege whether Applicant had ever illegally used a\n1\ncontrolled substance while \u201cprocessing\u201d rather than the correct \u201cpossessing a security clearance.\u201d  However,\nApplicant expressed no confusion and he admitted the allegation.\n2\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 13, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to another DOHA\nadministrative judge on February 18, 2009, and transferred to me on March 3, 2009. On\nMarch 13, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for April 1, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The government submitted four exhibits\n(Ex. 1-4) and Applicant one exhibit (Ex. A), which were admitted without any objections.\nApplicant testified on his behalf, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on\nApril 9, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for\nApplicant to submit a written, signed statement of his intent to refrain from illegal drug\nuse in the future. Applicant forwarded a notarized statement on April 13, 2009. On April\n16, 2009, Department Counsel indicated the government did not object to its admission,\nand the document was marked and admitted as Exhibit B.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that Applicant used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from at least 1996 to August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\nincluding after he had been granted a security clearance in September 2000 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c); that he purchased marijuana at times over an extended period for his personal use\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he received outpatient treatment from 1996 to July 2008 for\ndiagnosed alcohol and marijuana dependence, major depression, and anxiety (SOR \u00b6\n1.d). Applicant was alleged under Guideline E (personal conduct) to have falsified a\nJanuary 2000 security clearance application (SF 86) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and an August 2007\ne-QIP (SOR \u00b6 2.b) by falsely denying any illegal drug use in the last seven years; to\nhave also falsified the August 2007 e-QIP by falsely denying any illegal drug use while\npossessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.c);  to have deliberately failed to disclose\n1\nduring an October 2007 interview that he had been treated for marijuana dependence\nas well as for alcohol abuse and to have claimed he was sober when he was drinking\nalcohol on a daily basis (SOR \u00b6 2.d); to have failed to disclose during a followup\ninterview in November 2007 that he had been diagnosed with and treated for marijuana\ndependence, major depression, and anxiety (SOR \u00b6 2.e); and to have misrepresented\nhis marijuana use in his June 2008 response to interrogatories (SOR \u00b6 2.f). Applicant\n\nApplicant admitted that he first used marijuana at age 16, well before the time frame alleged in the\n2\nSOR.\n3\nadmitted the allegations, and the facts admitted are incorporated in the factual findings.\nAfter review and consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make\nthe following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old \u201cprinciple specialist-technical writer\u201d who has worked\nfor his employer, a defense contractor, since December 1999. He seeks a top-secret\nsecurity clearance after having held a secret clearance since 2000 (Tr. 26).\nApplicant served four years in the U.S. military from November 1976 to October\n1980 (Tr. 32). In June 1983, he married his first wife and they had two sons, who were\nborn in 1986 and 1988. Applicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce in December 1998\n(Ex. 1). His sons resided with him (Ex. 2).\nApplicant was granted his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in June\n1986 (Ex. 2, Tr. 31). Shortly thereafter, he was granted a secret-level security clearance\nfor his job with a defense contractor (Ex. 2, Tr. 32-33). He held that clearance until mid-\n1988 when he became unemployed. He did not require a security clearance for his work\nin the commercial sector as a controls engineer from January 1989 to November 1994\nand then as an electrical engineer from November 1994 to February 1997 (Tr. 32).\nFollowing six months of unemployment, he worked as a contract engineer for little over\ntwo years before commencing his current employment in late December 1999 (Ex. 1,\nEx. 2).\nApplicant began using marijuana at age 16 in social contexts (Tr. 32, 44).  As the\n2\nyears passed, he began to use marijuana to self-medicate, to deal with the emotional\ntoll of marriage to a woman with serious mental health and physical incapacitation\nissues (Ex. 3, Tr. 44-46). He obtained the drug from in-laws and friends (Tr. 44), buying\nit on occasion for his personal use. In about 1997, Applicant began outpatient\ncounseling for diagnosed major depression and marijuana dependence (Ex. 4). He was\nplaced on Wellbutrin medication by a psychiatrist at the treatment center, and continued\nto take the drug on and off. He did \u201cextremely well\u201d when he took the medication, but felt\nisolated and depressed when he was off the drug. Applicant had his medication\nrenewed every month or two from April 1998 to March 1999. During a session in July\n1999, Applicant indicated that he could not take time off from work for a therapy\nappointment, but that he was not using any mood-altering substances. In October 1999,\nhe telephoned the counseling center and requested Wellbutrin. He met with the\npsychiatrist in December 1999 and reported a significant decrease in stress in that he\nhad a new job with a defense contractor and he had a girlfriend who was moving in with\nhim (Ex. 4).\nOn January 21, 2000, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF\n86) for a secret-level security clearance for his new job. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to question\n27 concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled substances since the age of\n\nApplicant testified that alcohol became his drug of choice about a year into his second marriage.\n3\nAlthough he indicated it occurred in 2001 (Tr. 54), medical record information indicates he was using\nmarijuana heavily in September 2002 (Ex. 4).\n4\n16 or in the last seven years, whichever was shorter. He also responded \u201cNo\u201d to\nwhether he had  ever illegally used a controlled substance while possessing a security\nclearance (Ex. 2). Applicant chose to not disclose his past marijuana use because of a\nperceived stigma attached to illegal drug involvement (Tr. 27-28, 35). Applicant was\ngranted his secret clearance in September 2000 (Answer).\nApplicant met with his psychiatrist in March 2000 and in June 2000. By the latter\nsession, he had stopped taking the Wellbutrin on his own because he felt \u201cgreat.\u201d  There\nis no indication that he met with his psychiatrist at the center in 2001. In October 2001,\nApplicant married his second wife, becoming a stepfather to three young adults and a\n12-year-old (Ex. 1). Applicant had met his second wife at a Narcotics Anonymous\nmeeting. Applicant and his spouse both drank alcohol, but he did not recognize it as a\nproblem because he could leave alcohol alone after one or two drinks (Ex. 4).\nBy September 2002, Applicant was smoking marijuana chronically, smoking the\ndrug \u201cnonstop\u201d at times. On September 30, 2002, he met with the psychiatrist at the\ncenter. Applicant admitted he had used marijuana within the last two weeks, to relax\nand because it lessened his depression. He reported mood swings when he ran out of\nmarijuana. Applicant also reported drinking alcohol when angry and depressed,\nincreased drinking with his spouse, and altercations when they drank. Applicant was\ndiagnosed with major depression, marijuana dependence, and alcohol abuse. In the\nopinion of the psychiatrist, he had fairly good insight but exhibited some minimization of\nhis drinking problem and some ambivalence about getting sober (Ex. 4).\nApplicant managed only short periods of sobriety from marijuana and alcohol\nthereafter, although alcohol eventually became his drug of choice.  By the summer of\n3\n2004, he was drinking alcohol on a daily basis, but he managed to earn a second\nbachelor\u2019s degree in June 2004 (Ex. 1, Ex. 4). In the summer of 2004, Applicant had a\nserious altercation with his spouse, who was also an active alcoholic. Applicant left the\nhouse and was followed by his 18-year-old son, who brought him back home. His son\nthen drove off only to be arrested for operating without a license. Applicant resolved to\nwork on regaining his sobriety after this incident. He reconnected himself to self-help\n(Alcoholics Anonymous or AA) meetings and went back to the psychiatrist in November\n2004 for medication management and a psychiatric evaluation. Applicant was\ndiagnosed with marijuana dependence, alcohol dependence, and recurrent major\ndepression, and restarted on Wellbutrin. He was advised to return to the clinic in two to\nthree weeks. Applicant continued to meet with the psychiatrist on a monthly basis\nthrough mid-May 2005. He reported improved mood with sobriety and meetings,  but his\nspouse was still drinking as of mid-February 2005. In early April 2005, Applicant\nreported a relapse in March 2005, but that he had been sober for the two weeks\npreceding his session. He was started on Campral to treat increased cravings for\nalcohol but stopped taking the medication on his own. He continued to meet with his\n\nApplicant testified that he has seen a therapist at the center every two to three weeks for the past\n4\nten years. The record available for review does not include any notes of any sessions from the therapist. To\nthe contrary, there is no indication he was seeing the therapist in 2004, and his psychiatry progress note of\nApril 18, 2008, indicates that he was seeing the therapist rarely. (Ex. 4)\nThe psychiatry progress notes included in the record fail to confirm any sessions between June 2000\n5\nand September 2002, from October 2002 to November 22, 2004, or from October 2005 to August 2007 (see\nEx. 4).\n5\npsychiatrist for medication management until September 2005. In a follow-up session\nwith the psychiatrist for medication management on September 28, 2005, Applicant\nreported he was still taking his Wellbutrin and his mood was stable, but that he had\nresumed drinking alcohol with his spouse. He was ambivalent about medical advice to\nabstain (Ex. 4).\nApplicant and his second wife separated in April 2007 over parenting issues.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse moved to an apartment with her teenage son while her other\nchildren lived on their own (Ex. 1). On August 6, 2007, Applicant returned to the\npsychiatrist for medication. He had recent slips with drinking and marijuana use. He was\ndiagnosed with major depression, alcohol dependence, and marijuana dependence, and\nhis Wellbutrin and Campral medications were renewed. Applicant declined\npsychotherapy treatment,  and the psychiatrist recommended that he complete 90 AA\n4\nmeetings in 90 days (Ex. 4).\nOn August 14, 2007, Applicant completed an e-QIP in application for a top-secret\nclearance (Tr. 26). He listed alcohol-related and mental health treatment with the\npsychiatrist in response to inquiries about his medical record and uses of alcohol from\nabout June 2000 to present. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 24.a concerning illegal use\nof any controlled substance in the last 7 years or since age 16, and to question 24.b\nconcerning any illegal use of a controlled substance ever while possessing a security\nclearance. By signing the e-QIP, he certified that his statements on the form were \u201ctrue,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and [were] made in good\nfaith.\u201d (Ex. 1). He knowingly withheld the information about his illegal drug use, again\nbecause of the stigma attached to such drug abuse (Tr. 35-36).\nApplicant met with his psychiatrist on October 5, 2007, for about 15 minutes to\nassess his need for ongoing medication. Applicant reported that he was drinking alcohol\ndaily but not using illegal drugs. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and\nreferred for possible detoxification treatment. No medication was prescribed for him\nduring that session (Ex. 4).\nOn October 9, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his contacts with the psychiatrist and his drinking. He averred that he had\nreceived voluntary alcohol treatment with the psychiatrist on average once a month\nsince 2000.  Concerning his drinking, he indicated it escalated after his first marriage\n5\nended, and he drank hard liquor to intoxication three to four times a week. He claimed\nhe had been sober for about a year. He denied any illegal drug involvement, and\n\n6\nasserted that his SF 86 was accurate with some exceptions. He made no effort to\ncorrect his negative responses to the illegal drug questions (Ex. 3, Tr. 27, 36). On\nNovember 20, 2007, Applicant was reinterviewed for further details about his\ncounseling. Applicant admitted that he had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent but\ndenied he had been diagnosed with any other issues or involvement with drugs other\nthan alcohol. He expressed drinking was no longer problematic for him as he was\nabstaining from alcohol (Ex. 3).\nApplicant told his psychiatrist during a session on April 18, 2008, that he had\nbeen sober about 30 days and was attending meetings. He again declined any ongoing\npsychotherapy and requested that he remain off any medications. He was advised of\nthe potential risks/dangers of recurrence but was given no prescriptions (Exhibit 4).\nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA inquiring in part about whether he had\never used any illegal drug, Applicant indicated on June 5, 2008, that he had used\nmarijuana \u201csporadic periodically 2-3 occurrences every 1 to 2 years\u201d and that he had\nabstained since about August 2007 and had no future intent to use illegal drugs. He\nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to whether he had ever possessed any drug paraphernalia and added,\n\u201cMarijuana, various sporadic occurrences, alone at home.\u201d He also answered \u201cYes\u201d to\nany purchase of illegal drugs, and indicated \u201cMarijuana, random infrequent past\noccurrences, circumstances, and expenditures.\u201d He denied any current association with\npersons or places with a potential for illegal drug activity. He provided a letter from his\npsychiatrist dated May 23, 2008, in which she indicated he was compliant with his\ncurrent treatment, and she found no active symptoms that would indicate a flaw in his\njudgment or reliability in the context of safeguarding classified information (Ex. 3). At his\nnext session with the psychiatrist on July 11, 2008, Applicant reported he had been\n\u201cclean and sober\u201d since March 8, 2008. At his request, he was restarted on Wellbutrin\nfor diagnosed major depression and anxiety. He was advised to continue with AA\nmeetings and to return in one month (Ex. 4). \nAs of February 27, 2009, Applicant was still under the care of his psychiatrist.  He\nwas seeing her once every six months (Tr. 41). To the psychiatrist\u2019s knowledge,\nApplicant remains fully compliant with his treatment and highly motivated for sobriety\nwith regular AA attendance (Ex. A). On April 13, 2009, Applicant submitted a notarized\nstatement of his intention to permanently abstain from the use of alcohol and drugs with\nthe understanding that his failure to do so would result in automatic revocation of his\nsecurity clearance. Applicant also express a willingness to submit to random drug and\nalcohol testing to confirm his compliance (Ex. B). As of early April 2009, Applicant was\nattending AA meetings six to eight times a week (Tr. 42). He has had his current\nsponsor in AA since April 2008 (Tr. 50). His sponsor has 15 years of sobriety (Tr. 51).\nApplicant\u2019s employer and coworkers are still unaware of his past involvement with\nmarijuana (Tr. 43).\n\n7\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nwhich are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n8\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concerns raised by illegal drug involvement are set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant started using marijuana socially at age 16. He eventually turned to\nmarijuana to cope with the stress of marriage to his first wife, and in 1997, he was\ndiagnosed with marijuana dependence by his psychiatrist. As of September 2002, he\nwas using marijuana at times \u201cnonstop.\u201d Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist again diagnosed him\nwith marijuana dependence in September 2002 and in November 2004. While he had\nturned primarily to alcohol in recent years, he continued to smoke marijuana on\noccasion until about August 2007. He bought the drug for his personal consumption\nover the years from family and friends. Under Guideline H, four potentially disqualifying\nconditions are implicated: AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d 25(c), \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; 25(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse\nor drug dependence\u201d; and 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance.\u201d\nEven though Applicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana had declined in recent years, to as\ninfrequently as two or three times yearly or every two years (Tr. 39), the chronic nature\nof his previous abuse and the duration of his marijuana involvement (over 20 years)\nprecludes the application of AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\n\n9\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG\n\u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d applies in that he\navoids situations and persons who use illegal drugs (AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts\u201d), and he submitted \u201ca signed statement of intent\nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\u201d (AG \u00b6 26(b)(4)). It must be\nnoted in his favor that there is no clear evidence of marijuana use after summer 2007\ndespite increased feelings of anxiety and stress. He showed good judgment in returning\nto his psychiatrist and asking to be restarted on Wellbutrin as of July 2008. As of\nFebruary 2009, his psychiatrist found him to be highly motivated for sobriety, based at\nleast in part on Applicant\u2019s self-report of sobriety and continued regular attendance at\nAA. Applicant has a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional under\nAG \u00b6 26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including\nbut not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse,\nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional,\u201d although I cannot\nconclude that Applicant has completed a drug treatment program of the type\ncontemplated within AG \u00b6 26(d). His sessions with the psychiatrist  are only 15 minutes\nin duration and appear to be focused on adjusting his medication for his depression.\nAvailable progress notes of his outpatient sessions do not confirm ongoing counseling\nwith a therapist as of 2008. Applicant presented nothing from his AA sponsor or others\nin AA to corroborate progress made in his recovery through the AA program.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant intentionally concealed his involvement with marijuana when he first\napplied for his security clearance for his present employment in January 2000. He\nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to question 27 (any illegal use of controlled substances, including\nmarijuana since age 16 or in the last seven years) on his January 2000 SF 86 because\nof the stigma associated with such drug use. He was issued his secret clearance in\nSeptember 2000 based on false information. On an August 2007 e-QIP completed for a\nclearance upgrade, he reported his counseling with the psychiatrist, but responded \u201cNo\u201d\nto questions 24.a concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years, and 24.b, any\nillegal use of a controlled substance ever while possessing a security clearance. He\nknowingly concealed his drug involvement, again because he feared the stigma\nattached to illegal drugs. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\n\n10\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d is implicated because of\nhis falsifications of his security clearance applications.\nMoreover, AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative,\u201d must also be considered\nas a disqualifying factor. Applicant falsely denied during a personal subject interview on\nOctober 9, 2007, that he had been involved with illegal drugs. He also indicated that he\nhad been sober for the past year when only two days before, he had told his psychiatrist\nthat he was drinking alcohol on a daily basis, and his psychiatrist had referred him for\npossible detoxification treatment. He made several corrections to his security clearance\napplication during the interview, but did not correct his negative responses to the drug\ninquiries. When he was reinterviewed on November 20, 2007, to discuss his counseling,\nhe denied any diagnoses other than alcohol dependence, and again denied involvement\nwith drugs other than alcohol. Applicant now submits that in contrast to his first\ninterview, his intent in November 2007 was to disclose his drug involvement \u201cin the\nmedical context\u201d (Tr. 37), and that he signed releases for the treatment records that\nwould reflect his drug use. The available record does not contain the releases that\nApplicant claims he signed at the time, nor do the investigator\u2019s summaries of the\ninterviews indicate that Applicant signed releases. On June 5, 2008, in response to\nDOHA interrogatories, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to whether he had ever used any\nillegal drug, to include cannabis, but he described his marijuana involvement as\n\u201csporadic, periodically 2-3 occurrences every 1 to 2 years\u201d with abstinence since about\nAugust 2007. Admission of limited drug use, and through medical records his more\nextensive abuse of the past, does not eliminate the personal conduct concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s concealment of his illegal drug use from his security clearance\napplications and during his subject interviews also implicates AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities, which is\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d While\nApplicant is not required to inform his coworkers about his drug abuse, he continues to\nconceal his involvement even from his employer (Tr. 43).\nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 fully mitigate the personal conduct\nconcerns raised by his repeated concealment of relevant and material facts concerning\nhis drug involvement. Applicant deliberately concealed his marijuana use when he\ncompleted his January 2000 SF 86 and his August 2007 e-QIP, and during two personal\nsubject interviews in the fall of 2007. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts,\u201d does not apply. His unacceptable tendency to put his\npersonal interest ahead of his obligation of candor raises serious doubts about his\njudgment, reliability, and candor, so AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is also not satisfied.\n\n11\nApplicant has partially acknowledged his behavior in that he authorized the\nrelease of his treatment records to DOHA on October 14, 2008 (Ex. 4), and he admitted\nduring his hearing that he had knowingly and willfully withheld information about his\nmarijuana involvement from his security clearance applications and during his first\nsubject interview because of the stigma associated with illegal drug use. Admitting error\nis an essential element in rehabilitation and is required under AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual\nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur.\u201d Yet, when asked about his May 2008 disclosure of only sporadic\nmarijuana involvement on two to three occurrences yearly or every two years, Applicant\nresponded that it was his actual use as best as he could recall (Tr. 39). This account of\nhis marijuana use cannot be reconciled with the diagnosis of marijuana dependence, or\nwith his subsequent admission that marijuana became an addiction issue until alcohol\nbegan to take over (Tr. 44). When asked about the diagnosis of marijuana dependence,\nApplicant responded, \u201cI mean some of this terminology, just, to me, it\u2019s pretty highly\nsubjective terminology, I just, I mean as far as sporadic versus periodic or chronic.\u201d (Tr.\n51). Although he had told DOHA that he had last used marijuana in about August 2007,\nhe now claims to not recall the date of his last use other than he has been clean and\nsober since March 2008 (Tr. 49). The government still does not have a reasonably\naccurate accounting from Applicant of his history of marijuana use. In light of his\nextensive abuse at times in the past as the diagnosis of marijuana dependence would\nindicate, it is understandable that he would be unable to recall the specific dates on\nwhich he used marijuana. At the same time, it is difficult to believe he would not\nremember the circumstances of his use of marijuana. While he denies vulnerability\nbecause of his efforts to conceal his marijuana use, based on the facts of record, I am\nunable to fully apply either AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) or 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps\nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\nTreatment is not viewed negatively. A finding against Applicant is warranted because of history of\n6\nrelapses, including chronic use of marijuana at times, after he began a therapeutic relationship with his\npsychiatrist.\n12\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments\nunder Guideline H and Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in\nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional\ncomment.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana spanned more than 20 years. He turned to the\ndrug to cope with stress while he held a security clearance. Even after he married his\nsecond wife, and he began to drink more heavily, he continued to smoke marijuana on\noccasion. As of September 2002, he described his marijuana involvement to his\npsychiatrist as \u201cnonstop.\u201d He has a history of relapses into drinking and marijuana use\nin subsequent years, usually coinciding with times when he was not taking his\nmedication for his depression. His sobriety since March 2008 is a positive development\nin overcoming his addictions, but it is too soon to conclude that his marijuana abuse is\nsafely in the past given his history. Furthermore, his recent admissions of illegal drug\ninvolvement are not sufficient to overcome the judgment concerns raised by his\nrepeated deliberate falsifications. Based on all the information presented, I am unable to\nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\naccess to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant6\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. military. He has worked for a government contractor since the mid- 2000s. He experienced unemployment several years ago, when he quit his job to care for his ill wife. In addition to unemployment, he has also had \u201cdomestic difficulties,\u201d (Decision at 2) resulting from a charge of domestic abuse. While unemployed, he relied on savings to pay living expenses. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, for credit cards, consumer purchases, medical expenses, etc. Applicant advised creditors of his poor financial circumstances and of his intent to file for bankruptcy protection. He did not file for bankruptcy, however, and, at the close of the record, had an annual income of around $115,000, with $29,000 in savings. He has not advised his creditors of his improved economic circumstances. In holding against Applicant, the Judge stated that Applicant has not demonstrated \u201cthat he understood his financial responsibilities or how to resolve them.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under SOR subparagraphs 1 (m) and (n) are not at issue in this appeal. \n1\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 27, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process; whether\nthe Judge was biased against him; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were erroneous;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is erroneous.   Finding no error, we\n1\naffirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an honorably\ndischarged veteran of the U.S. military.  He has worked for a government contractor since the mid-\n2000s.  He experienced unemployment several years ago, when he quit his job to care for his ill wife.\nIn addition to unemployment, he has also had \u201cdomestic difficulties,\u201d (Decision at 2) resulting from\na charge of domestic abuse.  While unemployed, he relied on savings to pay living expenses.\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts, for credit cards, consumer purchases, medical expenses,\netc.  Applicant advised creditors of his poor financial circumstances and of his intent to file for\nbankruptcy protection.  He did not file for bankruptcy, however, and, at the close of the record, had\nan annual income of around $115,000, with $29,000 in savings.  He has not advised his creditors of\nhis improved economic circumstances.  In holding against Applicant, the Judge stated that Applicant\nhas not demonstrated \u201cthat he understood his financial responsibilities or how to resolve them.  He\nappear[s] not to understand the basics of keeping track of expenses and budgeting, leading to a\nconclusion that he could experience financial difficulties in the future.  Additionally, he had no plan\nin place to systematically resolve his delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies.  While\nhis unemployment caused unexpected hardships, he failed to deal responsibly with them.\u201d  Decision\nat 8-9.     \nConcerning the allegation of a due process violation, Applicant was advised of his right to\nemploy counsel, or to have some other person represent him at the hearing; his right to present\nevidence and witnesses; his right to cross-examine witnesses against him; and his right to object to\nevidence.  At the hearing, Applicant submitted numerous pieces of documentary evidence; testified\nin his own behalf, and objected to various documents submitted by the Government.  A review of\nthe entire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under\nthe Directive or that he had not been adequately advised of those rights.  ISCR Case No. 08-03110\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s brief, which in part is a denunciation of the Judge, alleges\nthat she was biased against him.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and\nunbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See,\n\ne. g., ISCR Case No. 07- 02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App.\nBd. May 14, 2004).  Applicant\u2019s complaints against the Judge appear, in large measure, to be\ndisagreements with her weighing of the evidence or with her evidentiary rulings.  The record does\nnot support a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion on this issue.  \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Among other things, Applicant argued that one of the debts\nalleged in the SOR which the Judge found against him was actually a repetition of another.  The\nJudge\u2019s finding on this matter is a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  Even if the\nfinding is in error, the error is harmless.  Applicant also states that the Judge erred in failing to note\nthat he had been acquitted of the domestic abuse charge.  Again, this is at most harmless error.  See\nISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) for discussion of harmless error doctrine.  Applicant  argues\nthat one of the debts alleged in the SOR is actually  his brother\u2019s.  However, a review of the record\ndemonstrates that Applicant asked his brother to include Applicant\u2019s name on the account in order\nto \u201cboost up\u201d Applicant\u2019s credit rating.  Tr. at 125.  The Judge\u2019s adverse finding on this matter is\nsustainable.  \nApplicant states that the Judge did not consider all the record evidence.  However, a Judge\nis presumed to have considered all the evidence, and Applicant has not supplied a basis to rebut that\npresumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-\n00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s reliance upon portions of the Adjudicative Desk\nReference (ADR) is misplaced.  DOHA judges are required to decide cases by using the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, not the ADR.  The ADR itself contains language indicating that it may not be cited as\nauthority for denial or suspension of access.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n28, 2008).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national\nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision\nat 10.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general standard\nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity\u2019\u201d). \n\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\n  \nSigned: Michael Y.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains 14 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all 14 allegations. Applicant is 41 years old, married, and the father of four children. He enlisted in the United States military in 1992 and served for eight years. He received an honorable discharge in 2000. He earned an Associate\u2019s degree in 1996. He also holds a diploma from a business college. Since March 2005, he has worked as a government contractor for his current employer. His gross annual salary for 2008 was in excess of $115,000. (Ex. 1; Tr. 112-114, 120-121.) After his discharge from the military, Applicant worked as a contractor for an employer for about 2 \u00bd years. Then, in May 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife, who was expecting their fourth child, experienced pregnancy complications and was placed on bed rest. Applicant tried to find a family member to help him care for his wife and three other young children, but no one in his family or his wife\u2019s family was able to assist him. Applicant quit his job and stayed at home to care for his family. He used his savings to support his family. (Ex. 3, at 7; Tr. 98-100.)

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on May 21, 2008. On November 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 5, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDecember 30, 2008. I convened a hearing on February 4, 2009 to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 6.  Exs. 1, 2, and 3 were admitted to the record without \nobjection. Exs. 4, 5, and 6 were admitted to the record over Applicant\u2019s objections.   \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced 15 exhibits, \nwhich were identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Exs. A through O and admitted to the \nrecord without objection. Applicant prepared two binders of hearing materials for the \nadministrative judge. With the exception of a letter, dated December 16, 2008, from \nDepartment Counsel to Applicant, the materials in the two binders duplicated evidence \nadmitted at the hearing. The first binder contained the SOR, Answer to the SOR, along \nwith documents identified as Applicant\u2019s 15 exhibits (supra), and Exs. 1, 2, and 3. The \nsecond binder contained the index of Government exhibits and Exs. 1 through 6.  The \nsecond binder also contained the December 16, 2008 letter from Department Counsel \nto Applicant. The two binders were admitted to the record. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) of the hearing on February 11, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 14 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied \nall 14 allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old, married, and the father of four children. He enlisted in \nthe United States military in 1992 and served for eight years.  He received an honorable \ndischarge in 2000. He earned an Associate\u2019s degree in 1996. He also holds a diploma \nfrom a business college. Since March 2005, he has worked as a government contractor \nfor his current employer. His gross annual salary for 2008 was in excess of $115,000. \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 112-114, 120-121.) \n \n \nAfter his discharge from the military, Applicant worked as a contractor for an \nemployer for about 2 \u00bd years. Then, in May 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife, who was expecting \ntheir fourth child, experienced pregnancy complications and was placed on bed rest.  \nApplicant tried to find a family member to help him care for his wife and three other \nyoung children, but no one in his family or his wife\u2019s family was able to assist him. \nApplicant quit his job and stayed at home to care for his family. He used his savings to \nsupport his family.  (Ex. 3, at 7; Tr. 98-100.) \n \n \nDuring the early summer of 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife accused him of domestic \nabuse. He was arrested, incarcerated, and arraigned. He received unemployment \nbenefits for a short time, but had no steady source of income. During this time of \nunemployment and domestic difficulties, Applicant relied on his savings to pay his \nfamily\u2019s living expenses. He acquired a number of additional delinquent debts, and he   \nbegan to receive foreclosure notices from the holder of the first mortgage on his house. \nOne of his brothers came to his assistance and helped him. He was able to sell his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhome. He used all the proceeds from the sale of his home to pay off his first and second \nmortgages.  (Tr. 100-108.)  \n \n \nFrom April 2004 to August 2004, Applicant worked overseas as an independent \nconsultant for a U.S. company. During this period, he also attempted to create a small \nbusiness. He used a software program he had purchased earlier to begin to trade in \nstock options and stock futures. After a few months time, he lost nearly all of his equity \nand could no longer trade. He fell further behind in his debts. He returned to the United \nStates and was unemployed from August 2004 until March 2005. (Ex. 3 at 7-8; Tr. 98-\n99.) \n \n \nIn March 2005, Applicant accepted employment with his current employer and \nwas assigned as a contractor overseas.  He worked overseas in a war zone for about a \nyear. He saved about $80,000 to $90,000 from his overseas employment.  When he \nreturned, his employer assigned him to a position in the United States. (Tr. 116-118, \n130.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was responsible for a debt of $1,878 which had \nnot been satisfied as of September 27, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.)  In his answer to the SOR \nand at his hearing, Applicant admitted the debt was his. He said he incurred the debt \nwhen he purchased, on credit, a sewing cabinet for his wife. When his unemployment in \n2003 and 2004 made it impossible for him to pay the debt, he notified the creditor that \nhe was contemplating bankruptcy and requested that the creditor take back the item.  \nThe creditor did not repossess the sewing cabinet; instead, it reported Applicant\u2019s debt \nas delinquent. Applicant denied responsibility for the payment of the debt and noted that \nthe creditor had not made any demands for repayment.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 4; \nEx. 6; Tr. 76-77.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was responsible for a $677 debt which remained \nunpaid and which had been placed for collection. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.)  In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant denied responsibility for the debt. However, he admitted the debt was \nowed to a dentist who cared for his children. He stated that the dentist failed to file \ninsurance claims timely before Applicant\u2019s health insurance was terminated by his \nunemployment. He stated that he had contacted the dentist and informed him he was \nunable to pay and contemplating bankruptcy. Applicant stated that the dentist had not \nmade an attempt to collect the debt. Further, Applicant denied a responsibility to pay the \ndebt. He stated his belief that the debt was \u201cclosed and otherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR; Ex. 6; Tr. 77.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed a credit card debt of approximately $1,834, \nwhich was in charged-off status and which had not been paid. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.)  The debt \nwas listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, including the credit report he submitted in \nresponse to interrogatories.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant said the debt belonged \nto his brother. He also stated that he had requested that his brother add his name as an \nauthorized user of the account in order to boost his credit score, and the brother had \ndone so.  He stated that his brother had recently filed for bankruptcy.  Applicant denied \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsibility for the debt. Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 15, 2008 identified the \ndelinquent account as an individual account. Two other credit card accounts listed for \nthe same credit card company on Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 15, 2008 identify \nApplicant as an authorized user.  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 5; Ex. 3 at 43-44; Tr. 78.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed a creditor approximately $345 on an account \nplaced for collection, and the account had not been satisfied as of September 27, 2008. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.)  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant identified the debt as a department \nstore credit card with a $300 limit which he had used to buy basic necessities when he \nwas unemployed. He stated he informed the creditor of his unemployment and intention \nto file for bankruptcy. He stated he had not received any notices of payment from the \ncreditor and considered the \u201cdebt closed and otherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; Answer to \nSOR; Ex. 4; Tr. 78-79.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed a creditor approximately $597 on an \naccount placed for collection and that, as of September 27, 2008, the account had not \nbeen paid. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.)  In his answer to the SOR Applicant identified the account as a \ncredit card debt incurred when he was unemployed.  He stated he had informed the \ncreditor of his unemployment, inability to pay, and plan to file for bankruptcy. He denied \nreceiving notices of payment due from the creditor. He stated that he considered the \ndebt \u201cclosed and otherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 6; Tr. 79-80.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed a creditor $206 on a medical debt which \nhad not been paid as of May 15, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.)  In his answer to the SOR and at his \nhearing, Applicant identified the debt as his. He stated that the debt was incurred when \na medical provider determined it was necessary for his wife to be hospitalized for a \nrequired time of 48-72 hours after the birth of their fourth child in 2003. Applicant \nobjected to the provider\u2019s decision not to release his wife sooner because it triggered a \ncopayment charge. He informed the provider of his unemployment, inability to pay, and \nhis consideration to file bankruptcy.  He stated that he considered the debt \u201cclosed and \notherwise resolved.\u201d  (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 3 at 24; Ex. 4; Tr. 80-81.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed a utility company a delinquent debt of \napproximately $308 and the debt had not been satisfied as of May 15, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g.) In his answer to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant identified the debt as a \nwater bill. He acknowledged the debt had not been paid.  He stated he had informed the \ncreditor that he was unemployed, unable to pay and considering bankruptcy.  He stated \nthe creditor had not presented him with notices of payment due.  He further stated that \nhe considered the debt to be \u201cclosed and otherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; Answer to SOR; \nEx.3 at 27; Ex. 4; Tr. 81-82.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was responsible for a credit card debt of \napproximately $400 that was 120 days past due and had not been satisfied as of May \n15, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.h.) Applicant acknowledged the debt and stated it had been \nincurred when he purchased basic necessities for his family when he was unemployed.  \nHe stated he had informed the creditor of his unemployment, inability to pay, and \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconsideration of bankruptcy. He further stated he considered the debt \u201cclosed and \notherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 3 at 42; Tr. 82-83.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed a debt of approximately $141 to a creditor, and \nthe debt was 120 days past due and had not been paid as of September 27, 2008. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i.)  Applicant identified the debt as owed to a credit card company for basic \nnecessities purchased for his family when he was unemployed. He stated he informed \nthe creditor of his unemployment, inability to pay, and consideration of bankruptcy.  He \nfurther stated that he considered the debt \u201cclosed and otherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR; Ex. 6; Tr. 83-84.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed $4,460 to a creditor on a debt that had been \ncharged-off and which had not been paid as of May 15, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.j.)  Applicant \nacknowledged the debt and said it resulted from the purchase and installation of an air \nconditioning unit in his home. He stated that he had informed the creditor of his \nunemployment, inability to pay, and consideration of bankruptcy.  He invited the creditor \nto repossess the air conditioning unit. The creditor did not repossess the unit but \ncharged off the debt. Applicant stated that he had received no further demands for \npayment from the creditor and considered the debt \u201cclosed and otherwise resolved.\u201d  \n(SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 3 at 25; Tr. 84-85.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed a creditor $1,468 on a bad debt which had not \nbeen paid as of May 15, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.k.)  Applicant denied the debt and speculated \nthat it was a duplicate of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s credit report of May \n15, 2008 shows different account numbers for the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.k.  \nAdditionally, the credit report shows that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. had been sold \nto a successor creditor by another name. Applicant failed to provide documentation to \ncorroborate his speculation. (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 3 at 43-44; Tr. 85.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed a municipal garbage collection facility $118 \nfor an account in collection status, and, as of May 15, 2008, the account had not been \npaid. (SOR \u00b6 1.l.) Applicant admitted this debt and attributed it to his period of \nunemployment.  He stated he had informed the creditor of his unemployment, his \ninability to pay, and consideration of bankruptcy. He stated he considered the debt \n\u201cclosed and otherwise resolved.\u201d (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 3 at 27; Tr. 86.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was 120 days past due on a home equity \naccount which had a remaining balance of $38,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.m.) Applicant provided \ndocumentation to show that the debt had been satisfied in full and the account closed. \n(SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. A; Tr. 86-87.)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that after paying his recurring monthly expenses, Applicant had \na net negative remainder of approximately $1,450. (SOR \u00b6 1.n.) In framing this \nallegation, DOHA relied on budget figures provided by Applicant in May 2008, in \nresponse to interrogatories. In his May 2008 response to interrogatories from DOHA, \nApplicant reported $29,000 in savings and provided the following budget: Total Net \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmonthly income: $6,595. Total monthly expenses, as follows: rent: $1,925; groceries: \n$1,500; clothing: $200; utilities: $510; car expenses: $550; life or other insurance: $0; \nmedical expenses: $200; miscellaneous: $2,071. He noted that these figures were \nrough estimates that varied from month to month. In his response to the SOR, he \nchanged his monthly estimate for groceries from $1,500 to $800. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 3 \nat 6.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was asked why he didn\u2019t keep track of his monthly expenses so \nthat he could list actual expenses instead of estimates, he responded that he elected \nnot to keep track of and list actual monthly expenses because he had enough money, \nfelt comfortable, and didn\u2019t need to \u201ckeep track of every nickel and dime.\u201d (Tr. 132-133.)  \n \n \n In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his circumstances had changed \nsince he reported the net negative remainder in May 2008. He stated he had received \npay increases and bonuses that raised his current income to approximately $117,300.  \nHe reported a positive net monthly remainder of $1,231, which he stated he intended to \nsave \u201cto eventually buy a house some day, begin some retirement contributions and \nsupplement other expenses that may arise.\u201d He further stated that was purchasing an \nautomobile on credit and considered that purchase to be his only \u201clegally obligated or \notherwise financial debt.\u201d  (Answer to SOR at 7; Ex. O; Tr. 87-95, 118-119, 123.) \n \n \nApplicant did not file for bankruptcy.  He has not notified the creditors identified \non the SOR that he did not file for bankruptcy, and he has not notified them of his \nchange in financial circumstances.  (Tr. 128-129.) \n \n \nNothing in the record suggests Applicant has had credit counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \n\n \n8 \n \n \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from   \nat least 2003, when he surrendered his employment to care for his pregnant wife and  \nthree young children. He was unemployed from May 2003 until April 2004 and from \nAugust 2004 until March 2005. Since March 2005, Applicant has been steadily \nemployed. His present salary is approximately $115,000 per year. He has \napproximately $29,000 in savings and reports a net monthly remainder of  $1,231. \n \n Applicant provided documentation to corroborate that he had satisfied a home \nequity mortgage of $38,000, alleged at SOR \u00b61.m.  While he acknowledged that the \ndebts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l were his, he did not acknowledge an obligation \nto pay those debts.  He argued that his periodic unemployment in 2003, 2004, and 2005 \nexcused repayment. While he was unemployed, he contacted the creditors to tell them \nhe was not working, was unable to pay his debts, and contemplating bankruptcy. Later, \nwhen he had a job, he did not inform them of his decision not to file bankruptcy. He did \nnot let them know he had a steady and well-paying job that would permit him to begin to \nsatisfy his old debts.  He did not act responsibly in dealing with a financial condition that \nwas initially beyond his control. \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. While he admitted his financial \ndelinquencies, it was not clear that he understood his financial responsibilities or how to \nresolve them. He appeared not to understand the basics of keeping track of expenses \nand budgeting, leading to a conclusion that he could experience financial delinquencies \nin the future. Additionally, he had no plan in place to systematically resolve his   \ndelinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. While his unemployment caused \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunexpected hardships, he failed to deal responsibly with them. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies in part. No other Financial Consideration mitigating conditions apply to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 41 \nyears. His financial problems began in 2003, when he found it necessary to leave his \njob and care for his wife and young children. This decision led to financial \ndelinquencies, which he has not addressed.  Despite an annual income of at least \n$115,000 and savings of $29,000, he has not taken affirmative action to pay or resolve \nhis delinquent debts, several of which are for relatively small amounts of money. His \ndeliberate failure to address his financial delinquencies continues to raise security \nconcerns about his judgment and reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhis financial delinquencies.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:           Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Walker, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on September 21,\n2006. On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ, G, and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on September 18, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October\n1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 29, 2009. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-6), which were received into the record without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of four\nwitnesses. He submitted Exhibits (AE A-C) at the hearing which were admitted into the\nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n2\nrecord without objection. I held the record open until November 12, 2009, so that\nApplicant could submit additional documents. The submission was timely received,\nmarked as (AE D) and entered into the record. Department Counsel did not object to the\ndocuments. DOHA received the transcript on November 6, 2009. Based upon a review\nof the record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 23, 2009, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d, and 1.e. through 1.h, and 2.a. and 2.b. He denied\nthe allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and 3.b of the SOR. He provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He received his\nundergraduate degree in 1980. He is a licensed realtor. Applicant is divorced and has a\nstep-daughter who lives with him and his wife. He was employed as an engineer from\n1981 until 2004 with a large company. He worked as a consultant until 2007. Applicant\nhas held a security clearance during his professional career. He has been with his\ncurrent employer since May 2007 (Tr. 121).\nIn November 1982, Applicant was with some friends in a bar. He consumed\napproximately three to five alcoholic beverages. As he was driving home, Applicant was\nstopped by the police. He was charged with (1) possession of a controlled substance,\n(2) driving while intoxicated, and (3) driving under the influence of drugs. He pleaded\nguilty and was sentenced to two years probation and received a fine (GE 5).\nApplicant admits that he was driving his own car, but it was also an assigned\ncompany car. He had two roommates who also used the car and he believes that the\ncontrolled substance belonged to one of the roommates (Tr. 127). He also claimed that\nhe pled guilty because he did not have an attorney. He believes he was not intoxicated\n(Tr. 128).\nIn April 1986, Applicant was at a restaurant where he had consumed two\nalcoholic beverages. He was stopped by the police while he was driving home. He was\ncharged with (1) driving while ability impaired, (2) illegal turn around, (3) expired license\nplates, and (4) failure to use or no turn signal. The alcohol-related charge was\ndismissed. He was found guilty of counts (3) and (4). He was also fined. Applicant\nbelieved that he was the subject of police harassment.\nIn May 1991, Applicant attended a bachelor party for a friend. He was \u201cticketed\nfor mooning out the window of a bus.\u201d He was charged with unlawful public indecency,\nand he pleaded guilty. He believes he was singled out and ticketed. He claims he was\n\u201cticketed\u201d and not arrested (Tr. 130). He explained that it was an embarrassing event\nbut it was harmless. Applicant was 33 years old at the time.\n\n3\nIn October 1995, Applicant was out with friends for the evening drinking. His\nfriend was too impaired to drive home, so Applicant decided to drive (Tr. 130). He was\ncharged with (1) failure to use or no control turn signal, and (2) driving while under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). He pleaded guilty to DUI. He was sentenced to probation and\nreceived a fine. His driver\u2019s license was revoked. Applicant completed a level 1 alcohol\neducation class. He also completed 24 hours of community service (GE 2).\nAfter Applicant divorced his first wife, he resided in a home with several\nroommates. He denies that he was ever in the residence when complaints were made\nabout noise. From 2000 until 2005, neighbors made complaints about noise (loud\nmusic) coming from his home. Applicant explained that he was single at the time and\nhad other people, including a girlfriend, stay at the house, without his permission (Tr.\n131). He believes that no charges were filed against him (Tr. 132).\nIn 2005, Applicant had a party at his residence. A live band was playing and the\nneighbors complained about the noise. A complaint was made to the county sheriff\nconcerning the noise. Applicant believes he was given a warning (Tr. 132).\nIn February 2006, Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct/noise. He was\nsentenced to one year of probation and he received a fine (GE 4). Applicant blamed this\nincident on a friend who was staying at his condominium, who became very loud,\nintoxicated, and unmanageable one evening. She caused a disturbance and the police\nwere called (Tr. 133).\nIn January 2007, Applicant and his wife had dinner in a restaurant (Tr. 137). They\nhad consumed alcohol and he drove home because he believed she was too intoxicated\nto drive. He was stopped on his way home and was charged with (1) driving under the\ninfluence second offense, (2) ran a stop sign, and (3) failure to maintain a single lane.\nHe pleaded nolo contendere to count (1) and was sentenced to one year probation, a\nfine, revocation of his driver\u2019s license, and DUI school. (GE 3).\nApplicant argued at the hearing that he was followed by the police from the\nrestaurant. He was adamant that he did not run a stop sign nor did he weave on the\nroad (Tr. 137). Applicant also believed he was not \u201cillegally driving under the influence.\u201d\nApplicant completed a Security Clearance Application on September 21, 2006.\nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23(f) \u201cIn the last seven years have you been arrested for,\ncharged with, or convicted of any offense not listed above\u201d He did not list his February\n2006 disorderly conduct charge. He states that he completely forgot about it. He also\nstated that he did not feel that it fell under \u201cthat area\u201d (Tr. 141) and did not have to be\nreported. He elaborated that it was the result of an unruly acquaintance of his, and he\ndid not want to deal with it anymore (Tr. 141). At the hearing, he explained that he was\nfocusing on the DUI incidents and \u201cI considered that very minimal\u201d (Tr. 142). \nIn a July 5, 2007, interview with an investigator from DoD, Applicant did not\nmention that police were called to his residence in February 2006 for the noise\n\n4\ncomplaints and disorderly conduct charge. He states that he completely forgot about the\ncharge because it was the result of an incident caused by an acquaintance with whom\nhe no longer associates. He denies that he deliberately failed to disclose this\ninformation (Tr. 159). In the interview, Applicant stated that he had no other alcohol-\nrelated arrests and he advised that he had not had any other \u201cproblems with law\nenforcement or been questioned by authorities in the last seven years (GE 2).   \nIn July 2007, Applicant was referred to a state treatment agency for the January\n2007 DUI offense (AE B). He met with a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), who is\nalso a certified abuse counselor (CAC). Applicant completed an initial written\nassessment and attended group meetings twice a week. Applicant was evaluated and\nwas given a low probability of having alcohol dependence (AE B; Tr 43). He received a\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse (Tr. 54). Applicant abstained from drinking during the\ntreatment. In April 2008, Applicant successfully completed 68 hours of Level II therapy\n(AE B).\nAt the hearing, the LCSW testified that it is highly unlikely that Applicant would\nhave another alcohol-related driving charge because he took responsibility for his\nactions. Applicant completed the level II program (alcohol classes for 34 weeks) (Tr.\n77). The LCSW explained that Applicant was conscientious in his attendance and was a\nthoughtful individual. Upon cross-examination, the LCSW acknowledged that Applicant\ndid minimize his responsibility for use of alcohol in his answers to the SOR (Tr. 63). \nApplicant claims that he occasionally has wine with his wife at dinner. He does\nnot drink during the week (Tr. 151). He believes he drinks every other weekend (Tr.\n152). He also stated that he no longer kept alcohol in the house (Tr ). He amended that\nby stating that his wife does keep some wine in the home (Tr. 150). Applicant does not\ndrive after drinking outside the home (Tr. 152).\nIn 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. When he admitted an allegation, he\nconsistently offered a reason why the arrest or charge should not have occurred.\nSpecifically, with regard to the April 1986 DUI, he believed he was the subject of police\nharassment. Applicant denied that he was illegally driving under the influence in January\n2007, and noted that the police car followed him from the restaurant until he was pulled\nover when he was almost home. He explained that he believed he was discriminated\nagainst and unlawfully charged with offenses that he did not commit. However, he also\nacknowledged that his drinking was \u201cborderline.\u201d As for the disorderly conduct charge in\n2006, he pleaded guilty but blamed the incident on a friend. For his earlier alcohol-\nrelated incidents in 1982, he maintained that he did not have an attorney and pleaded\nguilty even though he knew he was not over the legal limit (Tr. 127). He also said that\nhe was \u201csingled out\u201d for the unlawful public indecency charge (Tr. 129).\nApplicant was adamant that since he has held a clearance for 20 years and has\nnever had any security violations, he should be granted his clearance. He claims he has\nlearned from his mistakes in the past and has adjusted his behavior accordingly.\n\n5\nAt the hearing, Applicant appeared smug and noted that he learned from the\ngroup counseling that \u201cconsequences could happen to even me, you know, if you don\u2019t\ncontrol things\u201d (Tr. 169). His attitude, despite, what the LCSW reported, did not appear\nto be one of taking responsibility for his actions. He had an excuse for almost every\nincident that had occurred over the years. He distanced himself from each event. His\njob importance appeared to override his ability to accept responsibility for \u201cminor rules\nand regulations,\u201d such as the noise complaints. I find he minimized the severity of each\ncharge. \nApplicant has many letters of commendation and certificates of recognition from\n1993 until the present (AE A). He has 20 years\u2019 service recognition with one employer\n(AE A) He has made outstanding contributions to launch and satellite systems over the\npast years. Applicant is rated as an outstanding manager who has excellent\ncommunication and time management skills (AE C). \nThe security manager has known Applicant for 15 years. He has never observed\nany behavior on Applicant\u2019s part that would cause him to question his judgment or\nreliability (Tr. 94). He is aware that Applicant has several alcohol-related driving\noffenses, but does not believe that it rises to the level of concern (Tr. 98).\nApplicant\u2019s current manager described Applicant as a valuable employee\n(Tr.107). He praised Applicant\u2019s vast knowledge and level of experience. Applicant\ndisplays a high degree of honesty, loyalty, and integrity to his management and his\nteam (Tr. 115). \nApplicant\u2019s evaluations rate him as a \u201csuccessful contributor\u201d to his employer. He\nhas outstanding and advanced management skills. He is praised by his colleagues and\nformer supervisors as highly skilled and invaluable to the team mission.\nApplicant is lauded for his integration management skills. His technical expertise\nin the satellite program is key. He has many years of crucial experience (Tr. 27). He is a\ntrustworthy and reliable engineer and manager (Tr. 34). His former manager praised\nApplicant and has no hesitation in recommending Applicant for a security clearance (Tr\n36).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\n\n6\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\n\n7\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant was arrested in 1982, 1986, 1991, 1995, and 2007. Applicant has four\narrests for DUI or driving while impaired by alcohol. He was convicted of DUI in 1995. In\n2007, Applicant was arrested, charged, and pleaded nolo contendere to DUI Second\nOffense. He was charged and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in February 2006.\nAG \u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply in this case.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nApplicant had four incidents involving alcohol/driving from 1982 until 2007. He\nwas convicted of several misdemeanor offenses. He completed probation successfully\nin 2008. He attended court-ordered alcohol treatment in 2008.  \nApplicant\u2019s last incident of criminal conduct was the 2007 DUI (second offense).\nHe completed probation last year. However, insufficient time without offenses has\npassed when compared to the more than 20 years, from 1982 to 2007, of alcohol-\nrelated offenses to mitigate the government\u2019s case. He has shown that he is on the right\ntrack, but it is too soon to find that he is successfully rehabilitated. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and\n(d) do not fully apply in this case\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c22(c) \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\n\n8\nIn this case, Applicant admitted that he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and\nto the point of intoxication, from approximately 1979 to at least July 2007. He was\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser in 2007, after his second DUI offense. Although, he\nargues he was not DUI, he acknowledges his other alcohol-related arrests. Some of the\ncharges were dismissed, but Applicant was convicted of DUI twice. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (a) and (c)\napply.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(C) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and\nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has not fully acknowledged his problem with alcohol. Although he\ncompleted a treatment program, he consistently minimized his involvement in the\nalcohol-related incidents. He denied that he was illegally driving under the influence in\n2007. He did not believe he was intoxicated in several other incidents. He has modified\nhis drinking habits and does not drink and drive. His therapist believes that Applicant is\nvery unlikely to re-offend. I am not convinced that Applicant has taken full responsibility\nfor his past excessive alcohol consumption.\nApplicant has an outstanding work record spanning 20 years. He is\nrecommended for his fine work. He has many letters of commendation and appreciation\nfor his diligence in his field. The last alcohol-related incident occurred in January 2007.\nGiven the poor judgment shown over the years and minimization of his alcohol-related\nincidents there is still an issue of concern. Applicant has not fully mitigated the alcohol\nconsumption concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b), and (d). \n\n9\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d is\npotentially disqualifying.\nApplicant denied that he had a deliberate intent to falsify his answers to the\nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish pr prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine where there is direct\nor circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time\nthe omission occurred. \nApplicant was not credible in his various explanations concerning the omissions\ndescribed above. He stated that he forgot about the February 2006 incident and then\ncontradicted that statement with the fact that it was a nightmare and he wanted to forget\nit or that he was focusing on DUIs rather than any other incidents. He also had been on\nprobation for the incident in September 2006, and completed his security clearance\napplication shortly thereafter. Applicant also did not disclose to the investigator during\nhis interview that he had any problems with the law or had been questioned by\nauthorities during the last seven years.  At one point, he stated that it did not rise to the\nlevel of something that needed to be reported. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions, I find that none of them apply in this\ncase.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n10\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a well-educated, highly\nrespected employee. He has held a security clearance for many years without security\nviolations. Several character witnesses highly recommended Applicant for a security\nclearance.\nApplicant\u2019s patterns of criminal conduct and problems with alcohol span a long\nperiod. His most recent incident was in 2007. He completed probation in 2008. He has\ntaken steps in the right direction, but at this time Applicant has not met his burden of\nproof to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant is a seasoned employee who has completed security clearance\napplications several times. His explanations as to why he did not list his February 2006\ndisorderly conduct charge on his security clearance application are not credible. He\nintentionally omitted the information from the application and the interview in 2007. He\ndid not fully disclose alcohol use to the investigator.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct , alcohol consumption, and personal conduct concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 16, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 21, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n lnteragency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook.\n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51 year old employee of a defense contractor. She was born and\nraised in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). She emigrated to Australia in the late\n1980s and lived there until the late 1990s. She moved to the United States in the late\n1990s and has lived here since then. She became a U.S. citizen in 2004.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a PRC citizen who lives in the United States. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother is a citizen and resident of the PRC. According to applicant, her brother has\napplied to immigrate to the United States. She communicates by telephone with this\nbrother approximately once every three months.\nApplicant traveled to the PRC in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008. She visited\nher brother, at minimum, during her last two trips to the PRC.\nIn her response to the SOR, applicant stated she is \u201ca good American citizen\u201d\nwho has \u201cmade a lot of contributions to my country-United States and will continue to do\nmy best to make contributions to my country-United States.\u201d\nThe Government provided six official United States publications with the FORM\nthat describe the economic, political and intelligence activities of the PRC. The\nGovernment requested that these documents be admitted into evidence. I have\nadmitted the documents into evidence, and I take administrative notice of the following\nfacts found therein:\nThe PRC, which has a population of over 1.3 billion people, is ruled by an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC\ncontinues to have a poor human rights record. Reported abuses have included arbitrary\nand lengthy incommunicado detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of\nprisoners.\nPRC authorities monitor telephone communications, facsimile transmissions,\nemail, text messaging, and Internet communications. \nThe Intelligence Threat Handbook identifies PRC intelligence activities toward\nthe United States as follows: \u201cThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China\nbecause of the United States role as a global superpower; its substantial military,\npolitical, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a developer of\nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of\nAmericans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence targets by the\nPRC.\u201d  \n1\nOut of all the foreign intelligence agencies that continuously attempt to penetrate\nUnited States agencies, the PRC\u2019s is the most aggressive. Officials from United States\n\n3\nconsider the PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the\nsecurity of United States technology.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\n\n4\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph I., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of the PRC. There is a presumption\nthat an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, immediate family members\nsuch as a brother. Applicant failed to rebut this presumption. This relationship raises\nconcerns under the first two disqualifying conditions. In addition, since moving to the\nUnited States, applicant has visited the PRC at least five times, the last time earlier this\nyear. Applicant\u2019s presence in the PRC made her and her brother potentially vulnerable\nto exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the PRC government, which actively seeks to\nobtain classified and proprietary information from United States citizens of Chinese\nancestry who work for United States government contractors. These facts raise\nconcerns under the third disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe nature\nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate\n\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\n\n5\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s relationship\nwith her brother is one of obligation and affection, raising the concern that it creates a\nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant failed to provide sufficient credible\nevidence that it is unlikely she would placed in a position of having to choose between\nthe interests of the PRC and the interests of the United States, or that she is not\nvulnerable to a conflict of interest.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born and raised in the PRC. She has resided in the United States\nfor approximately 20 years. Her brother, to whom she has ties of affection and\nobligation, is a citizen and resident of the PRC. She has voluntarily traveled to the PRC\nat least five times since she moved to the United States. By maintaining a close\nrelationship with her brother, and by choosing to travel to the PRC, she has increased\nher vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, which could lead to the\nfuture compromise of classified information. I have carefully reviewed the administrative\nrecord, applicant*s submissions, and the allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and I have evaluated applicant*s\nconduct in light of the whole person concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure\n2 of the Directive. After doing so, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the\nGovernment\u2019s case under Guideline B.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\n\n6\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 4, 2008, and requested\na decision without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on February 13, 2009.  The Applicant received the FORM on\nFebruary  24, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information.  She\nsubmitted an undated statement that was received by DOHA on March 16, 2009.  The\n\n2\ncase was assigned to me on March 26, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 39 and single.  She is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance in connection with her employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe Applicant was served with Interrogatories concerning her debts on June 3,\n2008.  She elected not to provide documentation verifying payments to the creditors\nreferred to in subparagraphs 1.a.a., 1.a.b., 1.a.c., 1.a.d., 1.a.i., 1.a.j., 1.a.k., 1.a.l.,\n1.a.m., 1.a.n., 1.a.o., and 1.a.p.  (Item 7.)  The other debts set forth in the SOR were not\nreferred to in the Interrogatories.  \nThe FORM contained a Credit Bureau report dated January 24, 2007.  (Item 5.)\nThat report contains contact information for all of the debts referred to in the SOR,\nexcept as noted.\n1.a.a.  The Applicant denies that she is indebted to a medical practice in the\noriginal amount of $637.00 for a judgment.  (Item 5 at 3.)  She further states that she is\nunaware of the judgment.  (Item 3 at 5.)  There is no evidence that the Applicant has\ntaken any steps to resolve and/or pay this debt.\n1.a.b.  The Applicant denies owing $43.00 for a medical debt, stating she did not\nknow  \u201cwho or when this debt was made.\u201d  (Item 3 at 5.)  There is no contact information\nin the Credit Bureau report concerning this debt.  This allegation is found for the\nApplicant due to lack of evidence.\n1.a.c.  The Applicant admits owing a bank $970.00 on an account opened in\n2002.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has taken any steps to resolve and/or\npay this debt.\n1.a.d.  The Applicant admits owing a debt to a credit union in the amount of\n$171.00 on an account opened in 1998.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has\ntaken any steps to resolve and/or pay this debt. \n1.a.e.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $11,103.00 for an automobile loan in connection with a car that was\nrepossessed.  She states that the car was repossessed because she was laid off from\n\n3\nwork and unable to maintain the payments.  (Item 3 at 5.)  The Applicant has made no\npayments on this debt and has no current intention to make payments on this debt. \n1.a.f., 1.a.g. and 1.a.h.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted for three\ndifferent accounts in relation to student loans with Sallie Mae.  The total indebtedness\nwas originally approximately $10,456.00.  In her Answer, she stated that her intent was\nto bring these accounts current with a bonus check or tax refund.  (Item 3 at 5.)  In her\nResponse to the FORM, she stated, \u201cSallie Mae has been paid by Ed Fund.  I have set\nup a monthly payment with them for $87.00 a month that began on Dec. 15, 2008.\u201d  She\nsubmitted no other documentary evidence showing that the alleged events have taken\nplace.\n1.a.i.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a company in the amount of\n$3,070.00 for an account opened in 1998.  She states that she became delinquent with\nthis debt because she was laid off.  (Item 3 at 5.)  There is no evidence that the\nApplicant has taken any steps to resolve and/or pay this debt.\n1.a.j.  The Applicant admits owing a debt to a company in the amount of $182.00\non an account opened in 1998.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has taken any\nsteps to resolve and/or pay this debt. \n1.a.k.  The Applicant denies owing $1,244.00 for a medical debt, stating she did\nnot know  \u201cwho or when this debt was made.\u201d  (Item 3 at 5.)  There is no contact\ninformation in the Credit Bureau report concerning this debt.  This allegation is found for\nthe Applicant due to lack of evidence.\n1.a.l.  The Applicant denies owing $159.00 for a medical debt, stating she did not\nknow  \u201cwho or when this debt was made.\u201d  (Item 3 at 5.)  Contact information\nconcerning this debt is included in the Credit Bureau report.  (Item 5 at 11.)  There is no\nevidence that the Applicant has taken any steps to resolve and/or pay this debt. \n1.a.m.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a telephone company in the\namount of $679.00.  In her Response to the FORM, the Applicant states that she settled\nand paid this bill for a lesser amount.  This allegation is found for the Applicant. \n1.a.n.  Based on all of the available evidence, I find that this is a duplicate of the\ndebt set forth under 1.a.m., above.  This allegation is found for the Applicant.\n1.a.o.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a company in the amount of\n$1,000.00.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has taken any steps to resolve\nand/or pay this debt.\n1.a.p.  The Applicant admits that she is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $4,417.00 for medical bills.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has\ntaken any steps to resolve and/or pay this debt.\n\n4\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n2.a.q.  The Applicant filled out her Security Clearance Application on December\n19, 2006.  (Item 4.)  Question 28.a. of Item 4 asks the Applicant whether, within the last\nseven years, she had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts.  She stated,\n\u201cNo.\u201d She did not set forth any of the numerous delinquent debts described under\nParagraph 1, above.  This answer was, therefore, false.  \nThe Applicant denied this allegation and stated, \u201cI would never intentionally lie\nabout owing money.  I knew I had old debts past 7 years the only new debt was Sallie\nMae.  When I originally filled out paperwork I was up to date with them.\u201d  (Item 3 at 6.)  I\nhave considered this response in relation to the rest of the available evidence and find it\nlacking.  The response does not adequately explain the Applicant\u2019s conduct.\n2.a.r.  Question 28.b. of Item 4 asks the Applicant whether, as of the time she\nfilled out the Questionnaire, she was more than 90 days delinquent on any debts.  She\nstated, \u201cNo.\u201d She did not set forth any of the numerous delinquent debts described\nunder Paragraph 1, above.  This answer was, therefore, false. \nThe Applicant denied this allegation and referred to her response quoted above.\nI have also considered that response in relation to this allegation and find it lacking.  It\ndoes not adequately explain the Applicant\u2019s conduct.\n2.a.s.  Question 27.d. asks whether, in the last seven years, the Applicant had\nany judgments against her which had not been paid.  She answered \u201cNo.\u201d  The\nApplicant has consistently stated that, at the time she filled out the Questionnaire, she\nhad no knowledge of any judgment being filed against her.  Based on the available\nevidence, I find this denial to be both plausible and reasonable.  This allegation is found\nfor the Applicant.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n5\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\n\n6\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The evidence shows that the Applicant has over $32,165.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. This figure excludes\nthe amounts in allegations 1.b., 1.a.k., 1.a.m. and 1.a.n., which I have found for the\nApplicant.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between 2001 and 2002.  However, she only began\npaying the debts in 2008 - 2009, during the pendency of this proceeding.  While she has\nmade strides in paying her indebtedness, the fact that she had so many bad debts, for\nso long, and did nothing to pay them until a little over a year ago, is still troubling.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant argues that some of these debts\ncame from unemployment or underemployment in the 2001 through 2002 time frame.\nHowever, the Applicant has been working at her present employer since June 2006\nwithout making any strides to pay her debts until very recently.  I cannot find, under\nthese particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off some of her creditors.\nThe evidence shows that she has paid off approximately $1,000.00 to four creditors.\nHowever, she continues to owe over $30,000.00 to at least ten creditors.  In addition,\nthere is no evidence that she has contacted any of the creditors, even though the\nFORM provided her with a Credit Bureau report with that information.  AG \u00b6 20(d) is\narguably applicable.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Her past due indebtedness appears\nto all predate 2005. She is slowly paying her past due indebtedness.  This mitigating\ncondition is arguably applicable.\n\n7\nI have weighed the Applicant\u2019s conduct in paying some of her accounts in the\npast year.  In addition, I have looked at the circumstances in which she allowed this\nconduct to occur, particularly that she was laid off.  While she is paying her debts off,\nand is to be commended for that, I find that it is still too soon, given the other\ncircumstances of this case, to find that this conduct may not recur in the future.\nParagraph 1 is found against the Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) states that it may be disqualifying where an Applicant engages in the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  \nThe Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire contains false answers about her financial\nsituation.  I have considered her written statement, wherein she states that she would\nnot falsify a questionnaire about her debts.  That bald statement, standing alone, is\ninsufficient evidence to mitigate her conduct.  She obviously knew she had bad debts,\nand for some reason did not tell the Government about them.  It is her burden to show\nthat the act was a benign error and not an intentional falsehood.  She has not done so.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  Based on the record, I find the Applicant\nintentionally falsified her answers as set forth in subparagraphs 2.a.q. and 2.a.r.  Based\non all of the information set forth above, Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n8\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), all of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct, financial, and personal, is frequent and relatively recent.  Based on\nthe state of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), or that\nthe likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her\nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's\nStatement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.k.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.m.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.n.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.a.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On August 5, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence); and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz Jr. granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge erred by\nconcluding that the government failed to establish a case of heightened risk under Guideline B; and\n(b) whether the Judge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 8(a) is unsupported\nby the record evidence and is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. erred by concluding that the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns were not mitigated.  For the following reasons, the Board reverses\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance determination.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1970.  She immigrated to the United States in 1990, where\nshe lived with her aunt and uncle, who were both U.S. citizens.  She obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin 2001 and a master\u2019s degree in 2007.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997.\nApplicant has a Taiwanese passport which remains valid until 2012, but she has surrendered it to her\ncorporate security officers.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a resident citizen of Taiwan, and for the last 10 years has been retired\nfrom her job as an insurance agent for a private insurer.  Applicant\u2019s step-father is also a resident\ncitizen of Taiwan.  He has been retired for 11 years from his job as a ticket seller in a bus station.\nThe record does not reflect whether this was a position with the Taiwanese government or a local\ngovernment.  Applicant\u2019s brother is a resident citizen of Taiwan, employed as a junior high teacher\nin a private school.  Applicant talks to her brother and mother two or three times a month by\ntelephone.  Applicant also has some high school friends in Taiwan, whom she speaks to by telephone\nthree or four times a year.  One is a housewife, while two others work in a commercial electronics\ncompany.  Applicant visits these friends when she travels to Taiwan.\nSince 1999, Applicant has traveled to Taiwan once per year on average.  In 2000, she opened\nsome bank accounts in Taiwan so she would have quick access to cash.  She deposited traveler\u2019s\nchecks in her accounts and withdrew cash as necessary during her visits.  Typically, she would leave\nabout $200 in the accounts when she left Taiwan, but the accounts now have about $3,000 in them.\nApplicant derives no income from these accounts.  \n\n3\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy whose authorities generally respect the human rights of\nits citizens.  While Taiwan is an active collector of industrial information and engages in industrial\nespionage, the record does not demonstrate that the government of Taiwan targets U.S. intelligence\ninformation.  Further, the record does not demonstrate that Taiwan seeks to exert pressure on U.S.\ncitizens to collect information from family members residing in that country or abroad.\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, who is aware of her family background, testified that she had\nproven herself to be open, honest, trustworthy, and reliable in the six years he has known her.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less th an the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported bu substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.   Rather, Department\nCounsel asserts error in the Judge\u2019s analysis of the case and his application of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines.   Therefore, Department Counsel\u2019s appeal arguments are most appropriately addressed\nin the context of the Judge\u2019s conclusions as described in the section that follows.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA. Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions:\nForeign influence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country\nin which the foreign contact or financial interest is located\u2013including, but not limited to, whether the\ncountry is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected\ninformation, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the\nindividual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.  More specifically, an\nindividual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security\nconcerns only if those contacts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n\n4\nIn this case, the government did not establish that Applicant\u2019s contacts with her family and\nfriends in Taiwan created a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.  The government also did not establish that Applicant\u2019s bank accounts in Taiwan were\nsufficient to create a heightened risk of influence or exploitation.\nTaiwan and the U.S. enjoy excellent foreign relations.  Although Taiwan is an active\ncollector of commercial information, it has not been demonstrated to target protected U.S.\ninformation, nor has it been demonstrated to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information.\nGiven that Taiwan generally respects the human rights of its citizens, the risk that it might seek\nprotected information from Applicant is low, if not non-existent.\nThe government produced no evidence that there was a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s contacts with\nfamily and friends in Taiwan.  Applicant has resided in the U.S. nearly half her life.  Her contacts\nwith her parents, sibling, and friends are normal.  There is nothing in the circumstances of their being\nin Taiwan, or in Applicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that she could be impelled or\ncompelled to provide protected information to Taiwan.\nEven if the government had established security concerns based on her contacts with\nTaiwanese nationals and her bank accounts, those concerns would be mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts in Taiwan are routine.  Taiwan generally respects the rights of its citizens, and none of her\ncontacts in Taiwan are, or have been involved in activities that would make it likely that Applicant\nwould have to choose between their interests or those of the U.S.  The value and nature of\nApplicant\u2019s bank accounts are such that they are unlikely to be used effectively to influence her.\nB. Discussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \n\u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant,\ndeny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred by concluding that the government failed\nto establish a \u201cheightened\u201d risk in this case under Guideline B.  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments\nhave merit.  The Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings and record evidence that Applicant has close\nfamily members in Taiwan with whom she regularly communicates and visits, and that Taiwan is\na country that actively collects industrial information and engages in industrial espionage.  As\n\n\u2018[T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\n2\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests\nof the U.S.\u201d\n5\npointed out by Department Counsel, the Judge\u2019s conclusions in this case have the practical effect of\nrequiring Department Counsel to prove affirmatively that a country specifically targets U.S.\nintelligence information and specifically targets U.S. citizens in the course of attempts to gather\nprotected information.  The language of the Directive, Guideline B, does not require this level of\nproof from Department Counsel in order to raise security concerns that shift the burden of persuasion\nto Applicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05686 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2008).  Indeed, the\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d language in the Guideline  addresses an applicant\u2019s contacts, not necessarily the\ncountry that the foreign contact is from.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion on this issue is not sustainable.\nDepartment Counsel further contends that the Judge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence\nMitigating Condition 8(a)  is unsupported by the record evidence and is arbitrary, capricious, and\n2\ncontrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have merit.\nThe Judge based his mitigation rationale in part on his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nrelationships with her foreign family members and friends in Taiwan were \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201croutine.\u201d\nThe Judge does not define or elaborate on his use of the words \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201croutine.\u201d  In any event,\nthe ability to characterize an applicant\u2019s relationships with foreign resident citizens who are\nimmediate family relatives or close friends as \u201croutine\u201d does not vitiate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Indeed, the rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for immediate\nfamily members is based on the set of circumstances one normally expects to exist among close\nrelatives.  These circumstances include strong emotional attachments, feelings of obligation, and the\nmaintenance of regular contact with such relatives.  These are the very factors that give rise to the\npotential of exploitation and use of those relationships to place applicants in the position of having\nto choose between the interests of those individuals and the interests of the United States. The\nJudge\u2019s findings of fact in this case do not rebut the presumption.  Thus, the Judge erroneously\nemployed his conclusion that these contacts were \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201croutine\u201d as a partial basis for his\nultimate ruling that Applicant satisfied her burden of overcoming the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.\nThe Judge also based part of his mitigation rationale on his statement that Taiwan generally\nrespects the human rights of its citizens.  As Department Counsel points out, when evaluating the\nstrength of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, the Judge omits any consideration of Taiwan as an active\ncollector of industrial information and a user of industrial espionage techniques.  Taiwan\u2019s posture\nin this regard is of such significance that the failure of the Judge to factor it into his analysis of the\nstrength of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation was error.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that none of Applicant\u2019s contacts in\nTaiwan are, or have been, involved in activities that would make it likely that Applicant would have\nto choose between their interests and those of the U.S. is not supported by the record evidence.\n\n6\nDepartment Counsel characterizes the record as \u201csparse\u201d regarding the activities of Applicant\u2019s\nTaiwanese relatives and friends.  The Board notes that there is some record evidence of the\nemployment history and other life circumstances of Applicant\u2019s relatives and friends.  However,\ngiven Applicant\u2019s burden of production regarding mitigation, the Board is not able to conclude that\nthe evidence of record is sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.\nThe record as a whole does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of\npersuasion in light of the Egan standard.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is not sustainable.\n \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

She also visits these friends when she travels to\nTaiwan.\nSince December 1999, when she became able to afford it, Applicant has traveled\nto Taiwan once per year on average. On one of her trips in 2000, she opened some\nbank accounts so she would have automated teller access to cash. She deposited her\n\nApplicant estimates her net worth in the U.S. at $30,000.\n2\n3\ntravelers checks in her accounts and withdrew cash as necessary during her visit.\nTypically, she would leave about $200 in the accounts when she left, but for her last trip\nin April 2008 (for her mother\u2019s birthday) she took extra money but had not spent as\nmuch as she thought she might, so the accounts now have approximately $3,000 in\nthem.  She derives no income from the accounts. It does not appear from the record\n2\nthat Applicant requires Taiwanese citizenship to retain these accounts. Because she\nmaintains the accounts only for her travel convenience, she has expressed a\nwillingness to close the accounts as necessary. She has also expressed her willingness\nto renounce her Taiwanese citizenship.\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy, whose authorities generally respect the\nhuman rights of its citizens. While Taiwan is an active collector of industrial information\nand engages in industrial espionage, the record does not demonstrate that the\ngovernment of Taiwan targets U.S. intelligence information. Further, the record does not\ndemonstrate that it seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to collect information from\nfamily members residing in country or abroad.\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor\u2014the person who hired her\u2014testified that she had\nproven herself to be open, honest, trustworthy, and reliable in the six years he has\nknown her. He was aware of her family background, but was aware of no reason she\nshould not have a clearance.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the\nDirective. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy\nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering\nthe SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(e).\n6\n4\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n4\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  In\n5\naddition, security concerns may be raised by a substantial business, financial, or\nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated\nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation.6\nIn this case, the government did not establish that Applicant\u2019s contacts with her\nfamily and friends in Taiwan created a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. The government also did not establish that\nApplicant\u2019s bank accounts in Taiwan were sufficient to create a heightened risk of\ninfluence or exploitation.\nTaiwan and the U.S. enjoy excellent foreign relations. Although Taiwan is an\nactive collector of commercial information, it has not been demonstrated to target\nprotected U.S. information, nor has it been demonstrated to target U.S. citizens to\n\nIndeed, the government\u2019s closing argument focused not on Applicant\u2019s contacts in Taiwan vis-a-vis the\n7\nTaiwanese government, but on perceived risks posed by the fact that Taiwan is infiltrated with agents from\nthe People\u2019s Republic of Chine (PRC). Presumably, Applicant would not be able to distinguish these agents\nfrom any other ethnic Chinese on Taiwan. Assuming this is so, the government has still failed to establish how\nApplicant might be influenced to provide protected information to the Taiwanese government\u2014or to the PRC\nacting under cover.\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(a).\n8\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(f).\n9\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n10\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial . .\ninterests in another country;\n5\nobtain protected information. Given that Taiwan generally respects the human rights of\nits citizens, the risk that it might seek protected information\u2014or succeed in obtaining\nsuch information\u2014from Applicant is low, if not non-existent.\nExamining Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s contacts with family and friends in Taiwan.\nApplicant has resided in the U.S. nearly half her life, and most of her adult life. Her most\nsignificant financial interests are all in the U.S. Her contacts with her parents, sibling,\nand friends are normal. There is nothing in the circumstances of their being in Taiwan,\nor in Applicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten the risk that she could be impelled or\ncompelled to provide protected information to Taiwan. Similarly, her bank accounts in\nTaiwan amount to about 10 per cent of her net worth, an amount I consider insubstantial\nunder the circumstances of this case.\nEven if I were to assume that the government had established security concerns\nbased on her contacts with Taiwanese nationals and her bank accounts, I conclude that\nshe has mitigated the security concerns.  Her contacts in Taiwan are routine, Taiwan\n7\ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens, and none of her contacts in Taiwan are, or\nhave been, involved in activities that would make it likely that Applicant would have to\nchoose between their interests or those of the U.S.  Similarly, both the value and nature\n8\nof her bank accounts are such that they are unlikely to be used effectively to influence\nher.  The balances are not significant, and the fact that Applicant left the money in her\n9\naccounts after her last visit suggest that those sums are not necessary for her routine\nfinancial transactions in the U.S. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant obtained a Taiwanese passport in February 1996 and has\nopened and retained bank accounts in Taiwan, despite becoming a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in October 1987.  However, Applicant mitigated the Guideline C security\n10\nconcerns. Although she has been a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States since\nher birth, her Taiwanese citizenship has little security significance under the\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n11\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n12\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n13\ninvalidated; \n6\ncircumstances of this case. It is largely based on her parents\u2019 citizenship.   Further, her\n11\nTaiwanese citizenship does not appear to be required for her to maintain her bank\naccounts there.\nFor Applicant\u2019s conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, she\nmust have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United\nStates. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United\nStates is not required before the government can seek to deny access under Guideline\nC. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with this\nnation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which\nthey may also be a citizen.\n \nApplicant\u2019s active exercise of dual citizenship after becoming a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen was done deliberately, but unwittingly. She opened her Taiwanese bank\naccounts for her convenience traveling to Taiwan, not to indicate any preference for\nTaiwan. She has expressed her willingness to close her accounts and renounce her\nTaiwanese citizenship.  She was not aware of any prohibition on holding a foreign\n12\npassport. Indeed, there is no such proscription except in the context of clearance\nadjudications. She has surrendered her passport to her security office and understands\nthe potential consequences to her clearance should she regain possession of it.13\nFurther, given her work performance since 2002, she demonstrated that she can be\ncounted on to always act in preference to the United States. I resolve Guideline C for\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRonald C. Sykstus, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines G, H, J, and F are not at issue in this appeal.\n1\n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 23, 2010, after\nthe hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge mis-weighed the record\nevidence regarding his finding that Applicant falsified her response to a question on a 2007 security\nclearance application (SCA).   Finding no error, we affirm. \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer working\nfor a Defense contractor.  She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.  She previously\nworked as an engineering intern for another company.\nIn February 2004 Applicant was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a\ncontrolled substance, crack cocaine.  Police arrested her after discovering the cocaine in her car as\nshe was parked to use the drug.  At court the charge was deferred, conditioned upon Applicant\u2019s\nreporting to the judge once a month.

She pled guilty, but the court deferred adjudication\nconditioned on Applicant\u2019s attending Alcoholics Anonymous for six months.  She complied, and the\ncourt dismissed the charge.\nThe second incident occurred in August 2006.  Applicant was arrested at a safety check point.\nHowever, the court dismissed the charge for lack of evidence because the arresting officer failed to\nappear.\nIn May 2007, Applicant completed a SCA which inquired if she had ever had any drug or\nalcohol related arrests, charges, or convictions.  Applicant listed the August 2006 DUI arrest but\nomitted the May DUI as well as the arrest for crack cocaine.\nIn concluding that Applicant had deliberately falsified her SCA, the Judge considered her\nexplanation that she misunderstood the question, believing it did not require her to report dismissed\ncriminal charges.  However, the Judge noted the clarity of the question at issue, which militates\nagainst misinterpretation.  He also noted another apparent false statement, not alleged in the SOR,\nwhich he considered on the issue of Applicant\u2019s knowledge and intent.  He concluded that \n[t]he most likely explanation . . . is Applicant was trying to paint herself in a positive\nlight, because she was concerned that her police record . . . might be a hindrance to\nobtaining a security clearance.  Question 23(d) of the security clearance application\nrequired Applicant to provide a full, frank, and truthful answer about her police\nrecord and she failed to do so.  And the record does not support a conclusion that her\n\nfailure was due to a misunderstanding of the question or an honest mistake or simple\nnegligence.  Decision at 11. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge did not properly weigh the evidence\nwhich she presented concerning her state of mind when answering the question at issue.  She\ncontends that the record clearly supports an honest mistake rather than deliberate falsehood. She\nrelies on her answers to interrogatories.  It should be noted that a Judge is presumed to have\nconsidered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20,\n2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  In this case, the Decision\ndemonstrates that he did so, explicitly addressing Applicant\u2019s explanation for her omissions and the\ninterrogatories.  We conclude that the Judge reasonably explained why he found against Applicant\non this issue.  His finding of deliberate omissions is further buttressed by record evidence of the high\nquality of Applicant\u2019s academic work in a demanding curriculum.  A person with Applicant\u2019s\neducational attainments and apparent intelligence would be less likely simply to have misunderstood\nthe question.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13,\n2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nApplicant seeks a time-limited security clearance with probationary restrictions which she\nis willing to abide by in exchange for a permanent clearance subsequent to the probationary period.\nIt is well settled that the Board has no authority to grant a conditional or probationary clearance.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 08-04889 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-22044 at 2 (App.\nBd. Feb. 28, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Snable, Esq.  \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of drug abuse during 2003\u20132005, when she was a heavy user of\ncocaine. She has also had financial problems (e.g., two bankruptcy cases), and she\nwas arrested and charged for a drug-related offense in 2004, two alcohol-related\noffenses in 2006, and a bad-check offense in 2006. Applicant has made a remarkable\nturnaround, including earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and\nobtaining employment with a defense contractor. When she completed a security\nclearance application in May 2007, however, she did not provide a truthful answer to a\nquestion asking if she had ever been charged with or convicted of any drug- or alcohol-\nrelated offense. The record contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate her falsification and the concomitant security concerns. Accordingly, as\nexplained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nMarch 23, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to\nthis case. They replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit F at 9. \n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on February 27,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline G for alcohol consumption, Guideline H for drug involvement,\nGuideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline F for financial considerations, and Guideline\nE for personal conduct. The SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an\nadministrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me September 1, 2009, The hearing took place October 27,\n2009. The transcript (Tr.) was received November 3, 2009. \nThe record was held open until November 20, 2009, to allow Applicant to present\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission, and the post-\nhearing matters are admitted, without objections, as follows: Exhibit G\u2013student loan\ndocumentation.      \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old engineer who is seeking to obtain an industrial security\nclearance for the first time. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in\n2009, and she has since worked as an entry-level engineer for a defense contractor.\nHer current annual salary is about $50,000. Her current supervisor has observed that\nApplicant \u201chas exhibited character that indicates that she is a mature, responsible,\nconscientious, and trustworthy individual.\u201d  Previously, she worked as an engineering\n2\nintern for another company during 2007\u20132009.\nHer initial drug abuse consisted of experimental use of marijuana, LSD, opium,\nmushrooms, and oxycontin during 1996\u20132000. She married in 2000 and divorced about\ntwo years later in 2002. She did not use illegal drugs while married, but her marriage\nsuffered due to her husband\u2019s infidelity, verbal abuse, and financial mismanagement. \n\n Exhibit 5. \n3\n Tr. 86. \n4\n Exhibit 10. \n5\n Exhibit 4. \n6\n Exhibit 4. \n7\n Tr. 131\u2013133. \n8\n3\nAfter her divorce, Applicant used cocaine beginning in 2003, and continued using\nit until sometime in 2005. At times, she was a heavy user of crack cocaine, using it five\nto six times weekly, and she admits she became dependent.  \nWith her family\u2019s encouragement and assistance, Applicant entered a 30-day\ninpatient program in November 2003.  Although she completed the program, it was not\n3\noverly helpful for Applicant because she \u201clearned a lot more about how to do drugs.\u201d4\nShe completed the program in December 2003, and relapsed shortly thereafter. \nIn January 2004, Applicant sought to resolve ongoing financial problems by filing\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Most of the debt was credit card debt incurred before her\n2002 divorce. This included a credit card account her husband had opened in her name\nwithout her knowledge. The bankruptcy court granted Applicant a discharge in May\n2004.\nIn late February 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with the offense of\nunlawful possession of a controlled substance.  She was arrested after police found a\n5\nrock of crack cocaine in her car when she parked along a street to use the drug. Her car\nwas towed, and she was taken to the city jail and held for several days until released on\nbond. Subsequently, she appeared in court and prosecution of the charge was deferred\nconditioned on her reporting to the judge once a month. She did as ordered, and the\ncharge was eventually dismissed without a conviction. \nA few months later, Applicant entered inpatient treatment again in June 2004.6\nThis was a different experience compared with 2003, as this was a 13-week faith-based\nresidential recovery program, and it produced better results for Applicant. Program\nrecords show that Applicant reported daily use of cocaine with the last use taking place\non May 19, 2004.  In addition, program records show that Applicant described herself\n7\nthen as sad, lonely, depressed, and wanting to escape from life. She also reported the\nfollowing matters: (1) hearing voices or seeing things after drinking or using drugs; (2)\nbeing depressed to the point of being unable to make decisions; (3) suicidal thoughts;\n(4) attempting suicide about one month prior; (5) problems sleeping; (6) lack of appetite\nfor food; (7) feeling there was someone watching her or planing harm to her; (8)\nuncontrollable crying spells; and (9) physical and sexual abuse. She believes these\nmatters were tied to her cocaine use.  She attended group classes on various subjects\n8\n\n Tr. 122\u2013123. \n9\n Exhibit B. \n10\n Exhibit 8. \n11\n Exhibit 7. \n12\n Exhibit 9. \n13\n4\nand she had individual counseling as well. She successfully completed the program in\nearly September 2004. She relapsed again, although she believes it was a one-time\nincident in early 2005, when she smoked crack cocaine. She knew after she used it that\nshe did not want to use illegal drugs again and that she believed she was rehabilitated.  \n9\nIn 2005, Applicant had more financial problems due to her drug abuse, low\nincome, and not sufficient funds (NSF) checks. She sought to resolve her indebtedness\nby filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case and repaying her creditors through a court-\napproved repayment plan. It appears the plan called for Applicant to pay $75 biweekly\nfor a total of 60 months.  She did so, completing the plan ahead of schedule, and the\n10\nbankruptcy court granted her a discharge in July 2008. \nIn addition to her drug abuse, Applicant was arrested for two alcohol-related\noffenses. The first took place in May 2006, when she was arrested for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI).  According to the arrest report, Applicant was arrested at\n11\nabout 6:00 a.m. when a police officer found her car sitting in the middle of an\nintersection under a traffic light. Her intoxication was obvious to the police officer when\nhe spoke to her, and she stumbled out of the car when asked to step out. Her blood-\nalcohol level was tested twice with results of .298 and .20. She was arrested, her car\nwas towed, and she was held in jail until her release the same day at about 8:00 p.m.\nApplicant subsequently pleaded guilty to the DUI charge, but the court deferred\nadjudication conditioned on Applicant attending alcohol education classes, paying a\nfine, daily urinalysis, and attending Alcoholics Anonymous for six months. As a result,\nthe DUI charge was dismissed without a conviction. \nThe second DUI arrest took place in mid-August 2006, when Applicant relocated\nwithin the same state to begin her bachelor\u2019s degree program in engineering.  She\n12\nspent her first day there unpacking and then decided to go out for a drink after a long\nday. According to the arrest report, Applicant was arrested at about 1:35 a.m. when she\nwas stopped at a safety check point. She was held in jail until about 4:30 p.m. the same\nday. The court dismissed the DUI charge due to lack of evidence or failure to prosecute\nafter the arresting officer failed to appear. \nIn December 2006, she was arrested when she walked into a police station in\nresponse to an arrest warrant received in the mail for the offense of negotiating a\nworthless negotiable instrument (passing an NSF check).  She resolved the matter by\n13\n\n Exhibit 1. \n14\n Exhibit 2. \n15\n Tr. 129\u2013130. \n16\n Exhibit 6. \n17\n5\npleading guilty in municipal court and paying a total of $361, which included a fine, court\ncosts, and restitution. \nAbout five months later in May 2007, Applicant completed a security clearance\napplication for her job as an engineering intern.  In doing so, she was required to\n14\nprovide truthful answers to various questions about her background, to include her\npolice record and her use of illegal drugs. Questions 23a\u201323f concerned her police\nrecord, and she answered those questions in the negative except for two. For Question\n23c, she reported that there was currently a criminal charge pending against her. She\nexplained that the August 2006 DUI offense was pending a court date at that time. And\nfor Question 23f, she reported that, in the last seven years, she had been arrested for,\ncharged with, or convicted of an offense not listed in response to the previous\nquestions. She noted the bad check offense, which she resolved by going to the police\nstation and making payment. In response to Question 23d, she denied having ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any drug- or alcohol-related offenses.\nIn response to Question 24a about illegal drug use, Applicant reported that she\nhad used illegal drugs within the last seven years. She explained that she used cocaine\nan unknown number of times during the estimated period of June 2003 to August 2003,\na period of about three months. \nApplicant responded to various interrogatories issued by the Agency in August\n2008.  Asked why she failed to report the May 2006 DUI charge and the drug charge\n15\non her security clearance application, Applicant explained that she did not report those\nmatters because both charges were dismissed and she was not sure if she was\nsupposed to report them. She also noted that she did type the words \u201cdismissed case\u201d\nin response to Question 23, and she thought that would indicate that she had something\nelse that was dismissed. Applicant stood by that response in her hearing testimony.16\nIn September 2008, Applicant obtained an assessment from a drug and alcohol\nrecovery center.  The assessment appears to have consisted of a relatively brief review\n17\nof records and an interview with Applicant. The substance abuse therapist concluded\nthat Applicant required no treatment because her cocaine dependence was in sustained\nfull remission and alcohol dependence was in early partial remission. \nBesides the two bankruptcy cases, the SOR also alleged eight delinquent debts\nin amounts ranging from $54 to $64 based on eight returned checks from two creditors.\nAn August 2009 credit report lists the returned checks as collection accounts, but the\ncredit report also shows the debts were incurred in the February\u2013March 2005 period,\n\n Exhibit 3. \n18\n Exhibit C. \n19\n Tr. 126\u2013127. \n20\n Tr. 124\u2013125. \n21\n Exhibit D. \n22\n Exhibit E. \n23\n Exhibits A, E, and F. \n24\n Exhibit F at 8. \n25\n6\nwhich was shortly before the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was filed.  Applicant believes\n18\nthese debts were resolved by the bankruptcy, and she is formally disputing these debts\nthrough one of the major credit bureaus.  \n19\nApplicant reports that her current financial situation is stable. She has about\n$4,000 in cash in the bank and she has money in a 401(k) retirement account. She\ndenies any recent collection activity, with the last occurring before the Chapter 13\nbankruptcy case.20\n \n Applicant has a valid driver\u2019s license issued by her state of residence. She has\nhad no arrests since 2006; she is not pending any criminal charges; and she is not\nunder any form of court-ordered supervision or probation.21\nIn May 2009, Applicant completed her bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering\nwith a grade-point average of 3.364.  Her scholarship earned her membership in\n22\nseveral honor societies.  She also presented multiple letters of recommendation from\n23\nvarious individuals attesting to her remarkable turnaround and her suitability for a\nsecurity clearance.   \n24\nIt appears that one of the keys to Applicant\u2019s turnaround is what she learned\nduring the 13-week faith-based treatment program. She has attended a church on a\nregular basis since 2006, and she became a church member in 2008.  Her pastor\n25\nreports that she has been an active member, giving regularly to outreaches in the\ncommunity and ministry needs.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n26\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n27\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n28\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n29\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n30\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n31\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n32\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n33\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n34\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n35\n7\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n26\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n27\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n28\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n29\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n30\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n31\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n32\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n33\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.34\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.35\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n36\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, and 23 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n37\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, and 26 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n38\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, and 32 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n39\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n40\nconditions). \n8\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n36\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nThe allegations under Guideline G  for alcohol consumption, Guideline H  for\n37\n38\ndrug involvement, and Guideline J  for criminal conduct are discussed together\n39\nbecause the record shows they are factually interrelated. During 2003\u20132006, Applicant\nengaged in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and related criminal conduct that raised obvious\nsecurity concerns under the three guidelines. It is now apparent that this unfortunate\nchapter of Applicant\u2019s life is over. The record shows she was able to overcome these\nmatters through a combination of family involvement, determination, faith-based\ntreatment, higher education, a good employment record, and involvement in her church.\nThe record supports a conclusion that Applicant presented sufficient evidence of\nrehabilitation and reform to mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, Guidelines G,\nH, and J are decided for Applicant. \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n40\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n41\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n42\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n43\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(d).\n44\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n45\n9\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n41\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems or difficulties. The two bankruptcy cases, the delinquent debts, and\nthe NSF checks all support this conclusion. This history raises concerns because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n42\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more than\n43\nsufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. The facts also establish the\ndisqualifying condition addressing deceptive or illegal financial practices based on\nApplicant\u2019s NSF checks.     \n44\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  The six conditions are as follows: \n45\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and\n46\nmitigating conditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 15. \n47\n10\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nHere, the most pertinent mitigating conditions are \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(e), and\neach applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. Similar to her drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and criminal\nconduct, Applicant\u2019s financial problems were largely tied to the period of 2003\u20132006,\nwhen she experienced difficult personal problems. That period is safely in the past, and\nApplicant is now handling her financial affairs in a reasonable and responsible manner.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nTurning next to personal conduct under Guideline E,  it includes issues of false\n46\nstatements and credible adverse information that may not be enough to support action\nunder any other guideline. The overall concern is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n47\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 23d of her\nMay 2007 security clearance application. The falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 5.b\nalleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the May 2006 DUI charge and the drug\ncharge, both of which ended in dismissal. Applicant contends she did not report those\nmatters because she did not understand the question required her to report dismissed\ncriminal charges. Question 23d is clear, however, asking applicants if they have ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any drug- or alcohol-related offenses. In addition, the\ninstructions to Question 23 tell applicants to report information regardless of whether the\nrecord has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the court record except for certain\nconvictions expunged under federal law, which does not apply here. \n\n Although this matter was not alleged in the SOR, I considered it for the limited purpose of assessing\n48\nApplicant\u2019s credibility. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 16(a). \n49\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n50\n11\nAlthough her explanation is somewhat plausible, her credibility is further\nundermined by her apparently false answer to Question 24a when she misrepresented\nor underreported the full extent of her cocaine use.  Specifically, she reported using\n48\ncocaine for a three-month period in 2003, when she knew she had used it from 2003\nuntil sometime in 2005. Her answer to Question 24a was false because she knew she\nhad undergone treatment a second time during June\u2013September 2004, which took\nplace after her February 2004 drug arrest.  \nThe most likely explanation for all of this is Applicant was trying to paint herself in\na positive light, because she was concerned that her police record and her history of\nillegal drug use might be a hindrance to obtaining a security clearance. Question 23d of\nthe security clearance application required Applicant to provide a full, frank, and truthful\nanswer about her police record and she failed to do so. And the record does not support\na conclusion that her failure was due to a misunderstanding of the question or an\nhonest mistake or simple negligence.  \nThe established falsification supports application of the relevant disqualifying\ncondition that addresses the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from a security questionnaire.  I reviewed all the potential mitigating\n49\nconditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Making false or misleading\nstatements to the federal government during the security-clearance process is serious\nmisconduct. It is not easily explained away, excused, or mitigated. Accordingly,\nGuideline E is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s falsification of\nher May 2007 security clearance application justifies current doubts about her\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She did not present sufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and I considered all of Applicant\u2019s\n50\nfavorable evidence, which was not insubstantial.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on February 10, 2009.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On March 12, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2009 and April 25, 2009, and\nhe requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned\nto the undersigned on May 12, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 2, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 25, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented\nfive exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5.  The Applicant presented\none exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted into evidence\nwithout objection.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until\nthe close of business on July 9, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit additional\nsupporting documentation.  Applicant submitted two Post-Hearing Exhibits, which were\nadmitted into evidence without objection, and are referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-\n\n2\nHearing Exhibits A and B.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on July 2, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 46 years old, married, and six months away from a Bachelor\u2019s of\nScience Degree in Business Management.  He is employed by a defense contractor as\na Project Manager and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant admits that he was indebted to two separate creditors totaling\napproximately $23,386.00.  These two debts are set forth in the SOR under allegations\n1(a) and 1(b).  Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 19, 2006, November 25,\n2008, and June 19, 2009, reflect both of these delinquent debts as owing.  (Government\nExhibits 3, 4 and 5).  \nFrom 1994 to 2002, during a previous relationship, the Applicant lived paycheck\nto paycheck, and beyond his means.  (Tr. p. 43, 47).  He was in over his head,\nstruggling to pay the household bills and earning half of what he makes now.  He finally\ngot out of the relationship, did an inventory of his financial situation and started trying to\nrepair his credit.  In 2003, he made an intense effort to clean up his credit.  He sought\nout better employment opportunities at work, and used the extra money to pay past due\naccounts and collection accounts that are not alleged in the SOR.  (Tr. pp. 45-46).    \nSince receiving the SOR, the Applicant has worked hard to resolve his\nindebtedness.  A delinquent debt owed to Beneficial in the amount of $22,000.00, which\nwas a second mortgage on his home he bought in 1999, that was foreclosed upon in\n2001, has been settled.   The Applicant settled the debt with the creditor for $1,300.00.\n(See Tr. pp. 27-30 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  A delinquent credit card debt in the\namount of $400.00 remains outstanding.  The Applicant has made numerous efforts to\ncontact the creditor in order to pay off the debt, but has been unable to locate him. \nThe Applicant now handles his finances very differently than before.  He and his\ncurrent wife have been working hard to improve their credit.  They live frugally and live\nwithin their means.  Applicant\u2019s credit report is now hovering around 670 which is an\nimprovement.  He earns about $7,000.00 per month.  After paying his monthly\n\n3\nhousehold expenses, including making both his and his wife\u2019s car payments, he is still\nable to save money or go out to dinner once in a while.  The Applicant plans to continue\nto live within his means, pay his bills on a timely basis and be financially responsible.     \n   \nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Project Leader indicates that the\nApplicant is very responsible on the job.  He is considered reliable, timely and on\nbudget.  His leadership, accountability and organizational skills are a major reason he\ndoes his job so well.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).\nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for January 2004 through December 2004,\nJanuary 2005 through December 2005 and January 2008 through December 2008,\nreflect ratings of \u201cmet expectations\u201d and  \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d in every category but\none.  He has made good progress in learning his job.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit\nB). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\n\n4\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant has made a good faith effort to resolve his past due\nindebtedness.  The evidence shows that since receiving the SOR, the Applicant has\nresolved all of his delinquent debts, except one.  He would have paid if off, if he were\nable to locate the creditor.  He is over the relationship that caused him financial ruin.  He\nand his current wife are financially careful and responsible.  The Applicant has been\ncleaning up his credit and resolving his indebtedness.  Applicant understands that to\nhold a security clearance is a privilege and that he must be fiscally responsible at all\ntimes.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and, 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for\nthe Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\n\n6\nreliability, candor, and a  willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, and it mitigates the negative\neffects of his financial indebtedness and the effects that it can have on his ability to\nsafeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has\novercome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.   \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n  \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 29,\n2007. On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 25, 2008, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on September 29, 2008.  Applicant received a complete\n1\nfile of relevant material (FORM) on October 3, 2008, and was provided the opportunity\nDecember 19, 2008\n\n2\nto file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s\ncase. Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 12, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 25, 20087, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f through 1.I of the SOR. He admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c of the SOR with explanations but denied any intentional\nfalsification. Applicant denied the other allegations because the debts were disputed or\nhe had no knowledge of them. He did not provide additional information to support his\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school, and received an Associate Degree in May 2007. He is not married and has\nno children. He has worked for his current employer since October 2007 (GE 4). \nFrom 2000 until 2003, Applicant worked for one company (GE 4). He was\nunemployed for four months from May to August 2003 (GE 4). He worked as a\nCorrectional Officer from August 2003 until May 2005. From May 2005 until his present\nposition, he was not employed because he was attending college. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in\nJune 2004 in the amount of $25,000. The total amount of other debt that Applicant owes\nis approximately $15,922 (GE, 6, 7, 8).\nApplicant admitted that the account in allegations \u00b6 1.e through 1.I were\ndelinquent accounts and gave the reason as he was not working and was attending\nschool (GE 3). \nFor the following allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b, Applicant claimed that these\naccounts were included in his bankruptcy. He provided no documentation for this\nassertion and the schedule of creditors from the filing does not list any such accounts.\nIn addition, 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are still listed on the November 2007 credit bureau\nreport (GE 7).\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: the collection\ndebts and charged off accounts from 2003 until the present are delinquent and not paid.\nApplicant did not report receiving financial counseling.\nApplicant\u2019s answer and submissions to the FORM explain his attempts to remove\nthe delinquent debts from his credit reports because he either disputed them or claimed\nthat the debt was paid. He did not provide sufficient documentation to support his\nposition concerning the debts alleged.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $1,928. He reported monthly expenses\nof $1,720 a month. He listed payments for a medical account, a credit card account and\nan education service. His net remainder is listed as $33 (GE 5).\nApplicant completed his October 19, 2007 security application. In that application\nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23. Your Police Record - and \u201cno\u201d to question 28\nconcerning financial matters (GE 4).\nIn 2008, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that he misread the\ninformation when first filing the questionnaire but addressed the issues when he was\ninvestigated. He agrees with the facts in allegations 2a through 2c but denies that he\ndeliberately omitted the information. He apologized for the misunderstanding and stated\nthat he believed his bills were \u201cbeing slowly satisfied by his parents while attending\nschool.\u201d He elaborated in his answer to the SOR that he must not have read the\nquestion properly and he was not trying to hide anything (GE 3). He added that in\nregard to the arrest information (2.c) he thought the time frame was five years and not\nseven years. \nWhen Applicant completed his October 2007 security clearance application, he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to section 23: Your Police Record (which asks about prior arrests). He\ndid not report an arrest and charge for Battery and Disorderly Conduct on March17,\n2001. He pled guilty to the Disorderly Conduct charge on May 29, 2001. He also\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to section 28 (a) and (b): Your Financial Delinquencies. He listed his\nbankruptcy.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\nfiled for bankruptcy in 2004. He did not meet his financial obligations from 2001 until the\npresent time. His credit reports confirm that he has recent debts as well. The evidence\n\n5\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in approximately 2003. He accumulated some delinquent debt\ndue to an inability to pay his expenses while attending school and not employed. While\nthose circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that\npoint. He has not acted responsibly. His conduct over the last six months with his\ncreditors does not remove security concerns or doubts about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. He has approximately $15,000 in delinquent debt.\nThis potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported a period of unemployment in his answer to the FORM and in his\ninterview with the investigators due to attendance in college. Although Applicant\u2019s\nsituation may have started due to no employment and attendance in college and may\nhave initially started a downturn for him, he did not provide any explanation as to how\nthis impacted his ability to pay other debts. He also related that he thought his parents\nwere paying some of them. After he became re-employed, he did not act responsibly in\nidentifying and resolving these debts. In addition, he filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and\ncontinued to amass delinquent debt after that time. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20\u00a9. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. He promised to get his\nlife back in order and is in the process of clearing up unsettled debt. His promises to pay\nin the future do not constitute evidence of financial reform or resolution of debts. His\nreliance on his efforts to have items removed from his credit reports is not resolution of\nthe financial issue. His efforts are not sufficient to carry his burden in this case. I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant originally stated that he\ndisputed some debts. He did not elaborate and his responses and efforts focus on hiring\na law firm to remove the delinquent accounts from his credit reports rather than paying\n\n6\nthem or providing documentation that they are not his bills. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2007 security application, he did not\nlist any delinquent debts, or his 2001 arrest for Battery and Disorderly Conduct. He\nstated in his answer to the FORM in 2008, that he made an error in not listing the\nrelevant information concerning debts or his police record. His explanations are not\ncredible and not consistent. He provided deliberately false information. Thus, 16(a)\napplies.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns in this case. After considering them, none of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\n17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SF 86 in October 2007 is not minor. He did not\npromptly inform the government of his falsification. No one advised him to falsify his SF\n86. The falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. The falsification of his 2007 SF 86\ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Thus, none of\nthe mitigating conditions apply under this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n7\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant completed his degree and chose not to\nwork during that time. He had employment for a number of years after high school but in\n2004, he filed for bankruptcy. That is an acceptable means of debt resolution. However,\nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties and has not resolved many debts that\noccurred after the bankruptcy. The record contains scant information concerning\nApplicant. He chose to have his case decided on the written record. His answer to the\nSOR and submissions to the FORM are not sufficient for him to meet the burden in this\ncase. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 28, 2008 and answered it on\nthe same day. He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on December 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January\n13, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 4, 2009. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A at the\nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n2\nhearing, which was admitted without objection. I left the record open for Applicant to\nsubmit additional documentation. He timely submitted a packet which was marked AE\nB, and admitted into the record without exception. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on February 12, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 28, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the allegation in \u00b6\n1.c. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant is 37-years-old. He graduated from high school in 1991. He has two\nAssociate Degrees and he is attending college at the present time. He is married with\ntwo children. Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army (USA) from\n1996 until 1998 (GE 1). He has been with his current employer for almost three years\n(Tr. 16). He has held a security clearance since 1996.\nIn July 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence (DUI) and DUI with a BAC of .08 or more. He had attended a practice re-\nenactment. He and his friends went to a club after the practice. He consumed\napproximately four beers (Tr. 28).

He would drink on the weekends (two to four\nbeers) at a party or other social occasion. He sometimes went to a bar or clubs. His job\nrequired him to get up very early and thus he did not drink during the week (Tr. 27).\nApplicant has not had any other alcohol incidents since the 2003 DUI. \nApplicant completed his 16 hour alcohol counseling program in October 2003. He\nwas in a group counseling setting of approximately 12 people (AE A). He also attended\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) for a period of time. He denies that he was given a poor\nprognosis. He also denies that he reported drinking 24 beers in one sitting. He did not\neven see an evaluation report that was presented to the Court after the counseling\nprogram. He never received a diagnosis from the counselor. Applicant received no\ndischarge papers. The only paper he received was the Certificate of Completion.\nApplicant was credible in his testimony that he was not told to abstain from alcohol\nduring his attendance in the Level II program.\nApplicant completed his May 2008 interrogatories. He reported that he currently\ndrinks alcohol (wine and beer). He drinks beer on the weekends and he will drink a\nglass or two of wine two days during the week. He reports that he was intoxicated four\n\n3\nor five times within the last year (GE 2). He never drinks alcohol prior to work or at work.\nHe has never had any incidents with drinking alcohol at work. \nApplicant reports he has no craving for alcohol. He made a personal decision to\nstop drinking before he received the revocation notice. He and his wife stay home with\ntheir young child. His wife drinks on occasion. \nWhen Applicant decided to stop drinking (July 2008), he went to a counselor. He\nalso checked in with his AA sponsor. He is now attending sessions and meetings for\nsupport (Tr. 44). He and his sponsor discuss many aspect of life not just alcohol-related\nissues. He finds that he gets good advice on life in general (Tr. 44). \nAt the hearing, Applicant emphasized that his circumstances have changed since\n2003. He is now married and has children. He is serious about his career. He\npurchased a house and wants to provide for his family. He acknowledges that he made\na mistake and it was poor judgment on his part.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, team leader and senior analyst all praise him for his\noutstanding organization and his ability to successfully multi-task under pressure. He is\nhighly respected by his co-workers. He is being recommended for a higher position of\nresponsibility (AE A).\nApplicant\u2019s senior systems analyst describes him as \u201cthe fabric that holds his\nwork team together.\u201d He trains new employees and demonstrates loyalty to the group.\nHe is punctual and ensures that tasks are completed on time. He poses no threat or risk\nin his work. He is highly recommended (AE A).\nApplicant continues to complete specialized training courses to achieve\ncertifications in the area of information technology. He maintains a high level of\ntechnical knowledge. He displays a good work ethic. His attitude is positive. He has\nshown the highest level of integrity, intelligence, dedication and strength of character in\ncarrying out his duties at work (AE A).\nApplicant\u2019s friends and neighbors describe him as a stable family man and a\ngood father. He is a thoughtful person. He takes pride in his children and is active in\ntheir lives. He is well liked in the neighborhood.\nApplicant has an excellent work history. His appraisals indicate that he \u201cfar\nexceeds\u201d or \u201cexceeds most\u201d in all skill areas. He works with minimal supervision.\nApplicant\u2019s assignments demonstrate his quality, effectiveness, and thoroughness. He\nis a mature, quiet individual who maintains the highest professional/ethical standards.\nHe supports his team and fosters an environment of trust and respect (AE B).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nIn this case, Applicant has one arrest for a DUI in July 2003. He continued to\ndrink after 2003 and at some times to intoxication. Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (a) and 22(c) apply.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(C) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and\nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n\n6\nApplicant had one DUI in 2003. This is his only alcohol-related incident. Applicant\ncompleted the 16 hour alcohol education program. He was not diagnosed as an alcohol\ndependent or as an abuser. He never received an evaluation and was credible in that\nhe was not told to abstain from alcohol. Nevertheless, he attends AA and has a\nsponsor. He stopped drinking in or about July 2008. He is now married with children and\nhis lifestyle has changed. Applicant has an exemplary work record. He is lauded for his\nfine work. Applicant does not want alcohol to ruin his life. He values his work and his\nfamily. He does not frequent bars. He acknowledged that alcohol created a problem in\nhis life and he does not want that to occur again. His drinking, before he stopped,\nalmost a year ago, was moderate.  Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption\nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b), and (c).\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the USA and\nheld a secret clearance. He has no incidents or issues with protecting information.\nApplicant had one DUI incident five years ago. He completed his court ordered\nprobation and the 16 hour counseling program. He continued to drink in moderation until\nJuly 2008. He is now married and providing for his family. He attends AA and receives\nsupport from his AA sponsor. He has an exemplary work record from his current\nemployer and is highly recommended by his supervisor and team leader. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under alcohol\nconsumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Earl A. Partington, Esquire\nSeptember 16, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September\n28, 2006. On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nB for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on June 3, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on July 9,\n2008, and DOHA issued a notice of hearing on that date.  I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on August 13, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Government offered Exhibits 1\nthrough 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf.\nThrough counsel, he also submitted Exhibits A and B, which were entered into evidence\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on September 5, 2008.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the country of Iraq. The request and the attached documents\nwere admitted into evidence as Exhibit 2. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted the one SOR allegation, 1.a. The admitted\nallegation is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 60 years old, and he was born in the United States. Applicant is\nmarried, and he has two sons. His younger sons is a Captain in the United States Army.\nApplicant has received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications and a Master\u2019s degree\nin Management. Additionally, Applicant served in the United States military in a\ncombination of positions in both the Navy and the Army for approximately 28 years. He\nretired form the Army in 2000.\nApplicant is currently employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n1.a.  From January to September 2006, Applicant entered into a business\nrelationship with an Iraqi citizen (Ic), who gave Applicant $30,000 as investment capital.\nThis business ultimately failed, and all investment capital was lost and unrecoverable.\nApplicant has continued to have contact with this Iraqi citizen. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that in 2003, in his position as a security\nconsultant for an American private security company operating in Iraq, Applicant met\nthe Ic, who is the subject of this case, and who was an employee of this company. This\nIc worked for Applicant, and they developed a good working relationship and eventually\na friendship, as Applicant found this Ic to be trustworthy. In November 2004, Applicant\nleft this company, and they stopped working together, but they had a developed a\nrelationship where they continued to communicate through email and occasionally they\ntelephoned each other. \nIn 2005, Applicant formed an American company that was to be involved in\nexcavation in the United States. During Applicant\u2019s conversations with him, the Ic had\n\n3\nexpressed an interest in being an investor, and eventually he invested $30,000 in this\ncompany. Unfortunately, the company failed and all the investment capital was lost.\nApplicant testified that it was clear, that since the money that the Ic gave to\nApplicant was for an investment, which was ultimately lost, Applicant had no\nrequirement to return Ic\u2019s investment capital to him. Applicant stated that the Ic agreed\nthat Applicant had no duty to return the money that the Ic had invested, and that they\nstill remained friends.\nApplicant learned that in November 2007, the Ic, his wife and son moved to the\nUnited States, where they now reside and intend to continue residing, as legal aliens.\nApplicant has not seen the Ic since 2006, but their communication now consists of\nsending each other humorous emails. \nApplicant introduced Exhibit A, which consists of a copy of a cashier\u2019s check,\ndated August 8, 2008, in the amount of $30,000 from Applicant to the Ic. Exhibit B is a\ncopy of the letter, dated August 12, 2008, from Applicant  to the Ic, in which he informed\nthe Ic that he was enclosing a cashier\u2019s check of $30,000 to him, and a copy of the\npriority mail envelope addressed to the Ic in the United States. Applicant testified that he\nreceived the funds to make this payment by taking a mortgage on his home, and he\nwould be paying back the loan at the rate of $430 a month for 10 years. \nApplicant explained that while neither he nor the Ic believed Applicant had any\nduty or responsibility to return the Ic\u2019s investment of $30,000, he is doing so anyway, to\nremove any suspicion of undue influence or contact with a foreign national. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney represented to the Court, that immediately upon the\nconclusion of the hearing in this matter, he would be placing this letter and the enclosed\ncashier\u2019s check into the United States mail to be sent to the Ic.  \nCurrent Status of Iraq\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Iraq. In 2003, a United\nStates led coalition removed Saddam Hussein and his regime from power. In March\n2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office after being freely elected by the Iraqi people.\nHowever, violence, which has been perpetrated by Al Quaeda terrorists, Sunni\ninsurgents, and Shiite militias and death squads, continues to engulf the country,\nincluding terrorism against U.S. citizens. Finally, there are United States substantiated\nreports of human rights abuses including a climate of violence, a misappropriation of\nofficial authority, arbitrary deprivation of life and torture, and other cruel and inhuman\ntreatment or punishment. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). The one that could be applicable in this case is (a) contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s\nbusiness contact with the Ic, who is a citizen of Iraq, but now resides in the United\nStates, make DC (a)  a concern to the Government.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. \nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant is a natural born United States citizen, who served his\ncountry honorably in the United States military for 28 years. His son now serves as a\nCaptain in the United States Army.  Applicant  formed a United States business, with\nthe intention to do business in the United States. His business relationship with the Ic,\nwho was an investor only in Applicant\u2019s company, had ended in 2006, and there were\nno additional financial requirements or entanglements, once the company was\ndissolved. However, although not legally or morally obligated to do so, Applicant has\nreturned the Ic\u2019s $30,000 investment, in an attempt to eliminate the appearance of any\ncontinued business entanglement. Finally, the Ic and his family are now legal residents\nof the United States.  I therefore, conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

They hope to start a family in \nthe near future. They do not have a written budget. They have not had any financial \ncounseling, except through the loan officer. Applicant and her husband believe they can \npay off her debts within a year. She believes with their two incomes they can pay her \ndelinquent debts. She also admitted they are basically \u201cliving paycheck to paycheck.\u201d \nApplicant believes she has matured in the past few years and understands her \nobligations. Applicant tithes $500 a month and will not reduce that amount.10 \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified on her behalf and stated they both have stable jobs \nand they are trying to do different things to get credit \u201cwhere it needs to be.\u201d He stated, \n\u201cSo we\u2019re just really trying to get in the process of starting a family now and in the \nprocess of actually trying to get a house and just trying to do what we need to do to get \nthis situation resolved.\u201d He believes they can get the situation resolved in less than a \nyear.  They have been hindered from resolving their debts because there were two \n \n5 Tr. 33-35. \n \n6 Tr. 35-36. \n \n7 Tr. 36-37. \n \n8 Tr. 39-40. \n \n9 Tr. 40-42. \n \n10 Tr. 21-22, 44-65, 68. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ndeaths in the family in 2007 and they had to travel back home for the services. All of the \nplans on how to resolve their debts are in the planning stages, nothing has been acted \nupon.11 \n \n \n \nApplicant offered statements from friends and her pastor who believe she is a \ntrustworthy and honorable person. Her pastor considers her dependable and \nresponsible to her obligations at church.12 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n11 Tr. 72-74. \n \n12 AE A, B, C, and D. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Appellant has \nmany delinquent debts and has not paid any of them. She moved in 2006 and left her \ndebts behind her. She has made no arrangements to contact creditors nor has she \nmade even a nominal effort to pay even the smallest of her delinquent debts. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising form financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b620 (a) (\u201cThe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death , divorce, or separation\u201d), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u2018the person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant has many debts that are delinquent and she has made no effort to pay \nthem. I find (a) does not apply. Applicant did not offer any evidence that the debts were \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndue to circumstances that were beyond her control. She did testify that she incurred \nsome medical debts when she was uninsured, but did not offer any evidence that she \nacted responsibly. She also had two deaths in the family, but they happened in 2007 \nand many of her debts were before then. She has not presented any evidence that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. I find (b) does not apply. Applicant has \nbeen working with a loan officer to help manage her debts so she and her husband can \nbuy a house. I do not find this is the type of financial counseling necessary to assist her \nin resolving her financial problems and there are not any substantive tangible \nindications the problem is being resolved. Applicant testified of things she was planning \non doing or talking about doing in the future, but has not done anything at present. \nApplicant has not initiated a good faith effort to pay her creditors or to resolve her debts. \nI find (c) and (d) do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has numerous debts that \nshe left behind her when she moved and married. She stated she is now mature and \nresponsible, but has not begun any payment plans or otherwise initiated repayment or \nresolution of any of the debts. She has not sought constructive financial counseling, but \nrather is working with a loan officer to help her with her credit so she can buy a house. \nShe does not have a budget and although she and her husband have discussed plans \nto pay the debts, they do not have a substantive process to do so, nor has she taken \nany steps to pay any of the debts. Applicant has not acted responsibly and her inaction \ntoward her debts raises questions about her reliability and good judgment. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.o: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She is employed by a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline, except one, a debt for an unpaid medical account in the amount of $1,258.00. She believes that the debt is an error on her credit report. Credit Reports of the Applicant dated November 21, 2007, May 6, 2008, and July 24, 2008 collectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.

On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 25, 2008, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 7, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on January 14, 2009 and she submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on March 26, 2009.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 31 years old.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline, except one, a debt for an unpaid medical account in the amount of $1,258.00.\nShe believes that the debt is an error on her credit report.  Credit Reports of the\nApplicant dated November 21, 2007, May 6, 2008, and July 24, 2008 collectively reflect\neach of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  These reports indicate that the\nApplicant is currently indebted to at least nine separate creditors totaling in excess of\n$20,000.00.  (Government Exhibits 8, 9 and 10).  \nApplicant states that she is presently in the process of putting into place a strict\nbudget plan which will eliminate all of her debt within two to four years.  Since the\nbeginning of her security clearance background investigation, she has made several\nmajor changes in her life to get prepared for a more fugal lifestyle.  She paid off her car,\nmoved into an affordable apartment, became a junior deaconess in her church, and\nwent back to college.  She states that she no longer eats in restaurants, but carries her\nlunch from home.  She does not often buy clothing, and she is a smart shopper who\nuses coupons.  She always makes sure her monthly expenses are paid on time.         \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal for the period from August 2008 through\nAugust 2009, reflects two \u201cpoor\u201d ratings, four \u201cexcellent\u201d ratings, and two \u201cexceptional\u201d\nratings.  Her overall rating is \u201cvery good\u201d.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM).\nApplicant claims that as a result of her work ethic, she received a 10% pay raise this\nyear.  This pay raise will help her pay her delinquent debts and become fiscally solvent. \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \n\n4\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nApplicant states that she has set up a strict budget plan which will eliminate her\ndebt within two to four years, however, she failed to provide any documentary evidence\nto support her contention.  She failed to explain how her delinquent debts will be paid.\n\n5\nAlthough it appears that she understands the importance of financial management, in\nthat she has made some changes to reduce her expenses, she has failed to pay any of\nher delinquent debt.  A promise to take remedial measures in the future is not evidence\nof reform and rehabilitation.  Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that she can make her regular monthly payments in addition to making\npayments on her delinquent debts.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has\nnot introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient\nto overcome the Government's case.  \nWith respect to her finances, the Applicant remains excessively indebted in the\namount in excess of $20,000.00.  As of yet, none of the delinquent debts in the SOR\nhave been paid.  She is just starting the financial rehabilitation process and obviously\nhas a long way to go before her delinquent debts are resolved.  At the present time, she\nhas not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility or that she has resolved her financial indebtedness.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nOther than her favorable performance appraisal, the record is void as to any\nevidence in mitigation.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Her financial problems remain current\nand  they are not isolated.  The Applicant had not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to\nrepay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.   Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n6\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Guideline C - Foreign Preference The Applicant was born in Algeria, but first came to the U.S. at 20 years of age, to attend college, in 1976 (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 19, at page 35 line 23 to page 38 line 10, and GX 1 at page 12). After graduation in 1980, he returned to Algeria (Id). However, in 1983, he returned to the U.S. to attend graduate school (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 38 line 10, and GX 1 at page 11). He, soon thereafter, married his first wife, who was a citizen of the U.S. (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 38 line 10). The Applicant became a U.S. citizen in January of 1992 (Id, and GX 1 at page 7). In 1995, he was remarried to a naturalized U.S. citizen, who was also born in Algeria (GX 1 at page 16~17). She is a part-time school teacher in the U.S. (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 19). They have two children, ages 12 and 7, who were born in the U.S. (TR at page 33 lines 20~24). He owns a home in the U.S., earns about $115,000 a year, and has no potential inheritance in Algeria (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 19, at page 33 lines 4~7, and at page 47 lines 15~19). 1.a.~1.e. Although the Applicant does not consider himself a dual national with Algeria, he did exercise dual nationality by keeping and later renewing his Algerian passport, in 2007 (TR at page 32 line 21 to page 33 line",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire\nJillian L. Oportus, Esquire\nJuly 13, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 2, 2007.  On July 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines B and C for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 21, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 30, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on August 4, 2008.  This case was originally\nassigned to another judge on April 29, 2009, but reassigned to the undersigned on May\n\n2\n1, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on May 27, 2009.  The Government offered, by way of stipulation, Exhibits\n(GXs) 1 through 3, which were received into evidence.  Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through L, without objection.  DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 2, 2009.  The record closed on May 27, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Algeria.  The request was granted.  The request, and the\nattached documents, were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the underlying facts of all of the\nallegations of SOR, with explanations.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant was born in Algeria, but first came to the U.S. at 20 years of age,\nto attend college, in 1976 (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 19, at page 35 line 23 to\npage 38 line 10, and GX 1 at page 12).  After graduation in 1980, he returned to Algeria\n(Id).  However, in 1983, he returned to the U.S. to attend graduate school (TR at page\n35 line 23 to page 38 line 10, and GX 1 at page 11).  He, soon thereafter, married his\nfirst wife, who was a citizen of the U.S. (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 38 line 10).\nThe Applicant became a U.S. citizen in January of 1992 (Id, and GX 1 at page 7).\nIn 1995, he was remarried to a naturalized U.S. citizen, who was also born in Algeria\n(GX 1 at page 16~17).  She is a part-time school teacher in the U.S. (TR at page 24 line\n8 to page 25 line 19).  They have two children, ages 12 and 7, who were born in the\nU.S. (TR at page 33 lines 20~24).  He owns a home in the U.S., earns about $115,000\na year, and has no potential inheritance in Algeria (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line\n19, at page 33 lines 4~7, and at page 47 lines 15~19).\n1.a.~1.e.  Although the Applicant does not consider himself a dual national with\nAlgeria, he did exercise dual nationality by keeping and later renewing his Algerian\npassport, in 2007 (TR at page 32 line 21 to page 33 line 3).  He last used his Algerian\npassport to enter and exit Algeria in 2005 (TR at page 26 line 20 to page 27 line 4).\nHowever, in April of 2009, the Applicant destroyed his Algerian passport in the presence\nof his Facility Security Officer (FSO) (TR at page 25 line 22 to page 26 line 19).  This is\nevidenced by a letter from his FSO (AppX F).  The Applicant has also expressed a\n\n3\nwillingness to renounce any Algerian citizenship he may have (TR at page 40 line\n11~13).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s parents are deceased, but he has four sisters and four\nbrothers who are citizens of and reside in Algeria (TR at page 27 line 5 to page 32 line\n14).  None of these siblings have any connection with the Algerian government (Id).\nThe Applicant has a \u201cvery indifferent relationship\u201d with his siblings, and has had virtually\nno contact with them since 2005 (TR at page 27 line 5 to page 32 line 14, and at page\n42 line 6 to page 43 line 12).  None of these siblings works for the Algerian government\n(Id).\n2.b.  The Applicant\u2019\u2018s father-in-law and sister-in-law are also citizens of and\nreside in Algeria (TR at page 43 line 13 to page 44 line 16, and at page 45 line 16 to\npage 46 line 10).  Neither in-law has any connection with the Algerian government, and\nhe has little contact with either his father-in-law or sister-in-law (Id).\nThe Applicant would not be subject to coercion vis-a-vis any of his Algerian\nrelatives (TR at page 33 lines 14 to 19).\nI also take administrative notice of the following facts.  Algeria is a multi-party\nconstitutional republic that has suffered from domestic terrorism throughout the 1990s to\nthe present.  Although the U.S. seeks to support the recent democratic efforts in Algeria,\nthe U.S. Government has become increasingly concerned with the changing nature of\nterrorism in Algeria and its global efforts.  The U.S. has worked with Algeria to help\ncombat terrorism in that country, but its government projects inconsistent policies\nregarding its position on international terrorism, often in conflict with the U.S.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nParagraph 9 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Preference: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d\nSubparagraph 10(a)(1) is applicable: \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation\nof a foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of\na family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport.\u201d  Here, the Applicant, a naturalized citizen, used an Algerian passport to enter\nthat country in 2005.  This is clearly countered, however, by the mitigating conditions\nfound under Subparagraphs 11(b) and 11(e).  Subparagraph 11(b) notes that where\n\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d this is\n\n5\nmitigating.  I find that Applicant\u2019s renunciation intention to be genuine.  Furthermore,\nunder Subparagraph 11(e), the Applicant\u2019s \u201cpassport has been destroyed [in the\npresence of] . . . the cognizant security authority,\u201d his FSO.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s eight siblings, and father-in-law and sister-in-law are citizens of and reside in\nthe Algeria.  This is clearly countered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated . . . are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having\nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d\nThe Applicant has had little contact with his Algerian based relatives since 2005.  His\nAlgerian relatives have no connection with the Algerian government, and the Applicant\ncan not be coerced by the Algerian government vis-a-vis these relatives.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe Applicant has the unqualified support of those who know and have worked\nwith him (AppXs B~D and L).  Of particular note are the comments of his Director, who\navers, in part, the following:\n[The Applicant] . . . has shown himself to me to be an honorable,\ndependable person whom I have depended upon.  His actions have\n\n6\nalways been honest and straightforward.  He values his family and\nparticipates in their activities within the community.  He has frequently\nexpressed his appreciation for the values of the United States.  He desires\nto raise his family as Americans (AppX B).\nI have considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his alleged Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 29, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process; whether\nthe Judge\u2019s formal findings are inconsistent with his analysis; and whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the mitigating conditions.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is married with two\nchildren.  He holds a Bachelor of Science degree.  \nHe began using illegal drugs in high school.  He experimented with marijuana, cocaine and\nhashish during the late 1970s and used marijuana with friends while in college.  After college he\nwent to work for a Defense contractor and was awarded a security clearance.  Despite his knowledge\nof Defense policy on drug abuse, he continued to smoke marijuana, though at a reduced frequency.\nHe sometimes contributed money toward the purchase of marijuana for sharing among his friends.\nApplicant quit using marijuana in 2004 but resumed using it during the first half of 2005.\nHe has not used marijuana since June 2005, and he rarely associates with his former associates who\nwere involved in drugs.  \nIn 1980 Applicant tried cultivating marijuana.  He tried cultivating it again in 1987, growing\nfour or five plants in his closet.\nIn 1984 Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).  He omitted reference\nto his prior purchases of illegal drugs, due to embarrassment.\nIn 1988, Applicant was interviewed by a representative of the Defense Investigative Service\n(DIS).  He stated that the had omitted his drug purchase in 1984 due to concerns over the effect\ntruthful answers would have had on his clearance.  During this interview, he initially denied having\ncultivated marijuana.  However, when confronted with evidence that he had in fact done so,\nApplicant admitted the conduct and stated that he had lied in order to keep his job.  In this interview,\nhe stated that he would no longer use drugs.\nIn 2007, Applicant completed another SCA.  He admitted to having used illegal drugs, but\nhe denied the purchase, sale, or manufacturing of such within the previous seven years.  During a\n2008 interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant stated that he had never sold, supplied,\nmanufactured, or grown illegal drugs.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge cleared Applicant of the Guideline H\nconcerns.  However, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s omissions had been deliberate and that, under\nthe circumstances, he had failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from them.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s appeal raises the issue of whether he was denied due process. The issue involves\nthe testimony of an OPM investigator taken by telephone at the hearing and Applicant\u2019s efforts to\ncontact her though Department Counsel prior to the hearing.  Applicant argues that, with more time\nto prepare, he could have done a better job of questioning the investigator.  For this purpose both\nparties cite to documents which are not in the record.  Applicant submitted documentation to the\nJudge which was not admitted into evidence.  The Judge failed to preserve the documents for the\nrecord, which was error.  Applicant\u2019s brief contains four enclosures which, for purposes of resolving\nthis issue, the Board will accept as accurately reflecting the documentation not accepted into\nevidence.  \nEnclosure 1 shows that Applicant, by means of an e-mail dated December 14, 2009, to\nDepartment Counsel sought to obtain a statement from the OPM investigator to confirm his\ndescription of events or, in the alternative, to have her as a witness.  Enclosure 2 contains a letter\nfrom Applicant, dated December 28, 2009, to Department Counsel requesting contact information\nor a statement from the named investigator and delineating Applicant\u2019s attempts at contacting her\nhimself.  Also in Enclosure 2 is a list of documents to be presented at the hearing, including the\ncontents of Enclosures 1 and 2.  Enclosure 3 includes a January 11, 2010, e-mail from Applicant\nagain requesting contact information for the investigator so that Applicant can obtain a statement\nfrom her.  Enclosure 4 contains multiple e-mails dated January 11, 2010.  Department Counsel\nadvises Applicant that he has called the investigator, that the investigator has interviews in another\ncity the day of the hearing, so she cannot attend.  He then says, \u201cI will arrange with the Judge to do\ntelephonic testimony of her during our hearing.  We probably will have to take her out of order, but\nI cannot subpoena her.  Hopefully this will work for you.\u201d  Applicant responds: \u201cI appreciate your\nefforts.  I thought a statement from [OPM Investigator] to corroborate the interview discussion as\nI described would be sufficient.  Alternatively, her telephonic testimony will be greatly appreciated.\nI trust she has been advised of the matter and will have had an opportunity to review her meeting\nnotes?  Have you shared my description of the discussion with her?  Thank you again.\u201d Department\nCounsel responds \u201cI have provided her with Exhibits 8 and 9, the affidavits she prepared.  It will be\nup to you elicit expected testimony from her.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the hearing two days later, the OPM investigator was contacted by\ntelephone, and Applicant asked her several questions.  Although she recalled Applicant, she could\nnot recall the information he sought.  At no time did he object to the timing or the format of her\ntestimony.  After she testified Applicant said \u201c. . . I will describe the details of the testimony leading\nto the affidavit that contains my admission.  I did hoped (sic) that [OPM Investigator] would\nrecollect the details of the discussion better.  I\u2019ve been attempting to get in contact with her to\nrespond to my statement or provide testimony.  I appreciate the opportunity to have her.  And I\u2019ll\nhave to describe the details, by my recollection which was very vivid.\u201d  (Tr.  35)\nAt no time\u2013whether at the beginning of the hearing, during or after the questioning of the\ninvestigator, or at the hearing\u2019s conclusion\u2013did Applicant state that he had not had enough time to\nprepare.  We conclude that whatever objections might have been available to Applicant regarding\nthe timing of the witness\u2019s participation in the proceedings, her availability to Applicant, or the\nformat in which her testimony was taken, were waived.\n\nWe also note that, in the 2007 SCA (prior to the 2008 interview with the OPM investigator) Applicant denied\n1\never having used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance.  This denial is inconsistent with record evidence and\nthe Judge\u2019s finding that he had, in fact, done so.  Although this apparently false statement was not separately alleged,\nit is relevant to the issue of Applicant\u2019s knowledge and intent and buttresses the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\ndeliberately omitted information he was required to provide.  \n4\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his conclusion as to mitigation under Guideline\nE.  We have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  We note the multiple\nnature of Applicant\u2019s omissions and his stated motives for the ones occurring in 1984 and 1988.  We\nalso note the hearing testimony of the OPM investigator in which she unequivocally denied having\nadvised Applicant in 2008 that it was permissible to lie.   The Judge\u2019s conclusion as to mitigation\n1\nis sustainable, in light of the standard announced in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988) (\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent\nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d)   \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is inconsistent.  This argument pertains to a\nSOR allegation under Guideline E that Applicant had used marijuana while holding a security\nclearance.  The Judge entered a formal finding against Applicant on this allegation, although the\nAnalysis portion of the decision contains language suggesting that the Judge believed it had been\nmitigated.  To the extent that this is an error, it is harmless, in light of the Judge\u2019s sustainable\nconclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s deliberate omissions.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App.\nBd.

Billett\n\n5\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nConcurring Opinion of Administrative Judge James E. Moody\nI agree with my colleagues that Applicant has waived the due process issue by failing to have\nraised it at the hearing.  However, even if he had not waived the issue, I do not believe that he was\ndenied an adequate opportunity to prepare his case.  Applicant contended that the investigator had\nadvised him that it was acceptable for Applicant to deny having grown drugs, because his cultivation\nof marijuana had occurred a long time ago.  However, when questioned at the hearing, the\ninvestigator denied having said that.\nQ: Is it possible . . . I answered \u201cYes, I had grown a small amount, a small number\nof marijuana plants in the 1980s.\u201d  Do you recall, or is it possible that I did answer\nthat in our discussion that I had, in fact, admitted to that use?  \nA: I don\u2019t recall.  \nQ: . . . I asked you to read the statement again to see if there was some passage of\ntime that . . .  would allow a negative response to that question?  \nA: What are you asking me?   \nQ: . . . [I]s it possible that you advised me that the fraction was so small and so long\nago that that did not warrant a positive response?\nA: No.  Tr. at 19-20.  \nThe investigator\u2019s testimony was unequivocal that she did not advise Applicant that he could\nlegitimately deny having grown marijuana.  There is nothing in the record or in Applicant\u2019s brief to\nsuggest that he could have uncovered other evidence in support of his contention, if he had had more\ntime prior to the hearing.  I see no reason to believe that Applicant\u2019s right to prepare his case and to\npresent evidence in his behalf was compromised.   \nSigned: James E. Moody              \nJames E.

Despite his knowledge of Defense policy on drug abuse, he continued to smoke marijuana, though at a reduced frequency.

He tried cultivating it again in 1987, growing four or five plants in his closet. In 1984 Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). He omitted reference to his prior purchases of illegal drugs, due to embarrassment. In 1988, Applicant was interviewed by a representative of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS). He stated that the had omitted his drug purchase in 1984 due to concerns over the effect truthful answers would have had on his clearance.

A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. At hearing, the\ngovernment's case consisted of nine  exhibits and a summary of the governing federal\nlaw controlling controlled substances (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812, et seq. for legal guidance.\nApplicant, in turn, relied on two witnesses (including himself) and nine exhibits.  The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on January 27, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\nMarch 29, 2010\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, the government alleged that Applicant (a) used marijuana with\nvarying frequency from 1997 to 2005; (b) purchased marijuana, (c) cultivated marijuana,\n(d) used cocaine in 1977, (e) used hashish between 1977 and 1981, and (f) was arrested\nin 1979 for DUI and possession of cannabis. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his security clearance\napplication (DD-49) of December 1984 by omitting his drug usage; (b) misrepresented\nhis drug usage in his August 1988 Defense Security Service (DSS) interview, (c) falsified\nhis October 2008 affidavit submitted to DoD by denying any prior drug usage, and (d)\nbeen terminated in October 2004 for making inappropriate harassing comments and\nfailing to treat other employees with dignity and respect.  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. He\nassured he ceased his use of illegal drugs over four years previous after considering the\nimplications on his parenting, employment, and civic responsibilities.  He acknowledged\nhis making poor decisions with regard to illegal drug use, cultivation, and dishonesty in\nhis college years and early twenties. Applicant claimed embarrassment over his prior\nfalsification of his drug use and cultivation in his DD-49.  He claimed he denied any prior\ncultivation based on the advice he received from the interviewing DoD agent who\nconducted his October 2008 interview. Applicant claimed exceptional performance\nevaluations from his employers and praise from his former colleagues for his\ndemonstrated integrity, professionalism, interpersonal skills, and adherence to company\nethics.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old engineering specialist for a defense contractor who\nseeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted\nby Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is married and has two children (see ex. 1; Tr. 101-02).  He earned a\nbachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from an accredited university in\nSeptember 1983 (ex. 1).\nApplicant was introduced to illegal drugs in high school.  He experimented with\nmarijuana, cocaine, and hashish between 1977 and 1981 (Tr. 63). He continued to use\nmarijuana (mostly with friends in social situations) throughout his college years (Tr. 102-\n03).  While in college, he estimates he used marijuana a couple of times a  week on\naverage (Tr. 103).  \n\n3\nIn 1979, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)\nand possession of marijuana (see ex. 1). He pled guilty to the DUI charges, and the\nmarijuana possession charge was dismissed (see exs. 2, 3, and 4).\nAfter college, Applicant joined a defense contractor and was granted a security\nclearance (Tr. 102). Aware of DoD policy against drug use, he continued to use\nmarijuana, albeit at a reduced frequency of once or twice a month on average (Tr. 66,\n102-04). Within six months, though, he had increased his frequency of use to three to\nfour times a month and maintained this frequency rate on average between 1985 and\nFebruary 2004, (see ex. 8; Tr. 80-83, 104-06, 111-12).  While he would sometimes skip\nseveral months of marijuana use, he always returned to this frequency rate before giving\nup drugs altogether in June 2005 (ex. 8; Tr.82-83, 106-07). He occasionally contributed\n$20 to $30 toward towards  purchases for sharing among his friends (Tr. 78-79, 104,\n121).\nShortly after December 1984, Applicant\u2019s clearance was deactivated. This\nprompted him to leave the defense industry for a number of years and resume his use of\nmarijuana (Tr. 104-06).  Applicant quit using marijuana in October 2004 for about six\nmonths while he was pursuing employment opportunities.  He resumed his marijuana\nuse for a few months in 2005, before using it for the last time in June 2005 (Tr. 80-82,\n111-12).  Since ceasing his use of marijuana, he rarely associates with any members of\nhis former group who were involved in marijuana activity (Tr. 107-08, 129-33). And  he\nassures he will never use illegal drugs in the future (see ex. I). His assurances are not\nchallenged by any countervailing evidence and are accepted.\nIn 1980, Applicant experimented with cultivating marijuana.  His attempts were\nlimited to planting a few seeds on his balcony (see ex. 4; Tr. 62).  Applicant tried growing\nmarijuana once again in his home In 1987. This time, he grew four to five marijuana\nplants in his closet (Tr. 62-63). His 1987 attempt is  the last time he admits to cultivating\nor experimenting in the growth of marijuana (Tr. 63).\nAsked to complete a DD-49 in December 1984, Applicant omitted his prior\npurchases of illegal drugs (see exs. 3, 4, and 6). He attributed his omission to\nembarrassment (Tr. 68). \nIn an ensuing interview with an investigator from the Defense Investigator Service\n(DSS) in August 1988, Applicant acknowledged omitting his active drug use, purchases,\nand cultivation when completing a December 1984 DD-49 (see ex. 4).  He attributed his\nomissions to concerns about what effects truthful disclosures would have on his\nclearance (ex. 4). When first asked about DSS reports of his prior cultivation of\nmarijuana, he denied any involvement.  Only after he was confronted with the details did\nbe admit to growing marijuana in his closet for about three months in 1987 (ex. 4).  He\nestimated the five plants he cultivated grew to about four feet (ex. 4).  He attributed his\nprevious misrepresentations to concerns about keeping his job (see ex. 4).\n\n4\nIn his August 1988 DSS interview, Applicant assured he had stopped using illegal\ndrugs because of his pending clearance investigation, his understanding of DoD policy,\nand his concerns for his physical fitness (see ex. 4).  He committed to avoiding illegal\ndrugs in the future (ex. 4).  \nUpon his return to the defense industry in 2007, Applicant completed an updated\nsecurity clearance application (e-QIP).  In this e-QIP, he admitted to using illegal drugs\n(marijuana) three to four times a month between January 2000 and October 2004, and\nresuming his use of the substance in May 2005: twice between May and June 2005 (see\nex. 7).  He denied any purchases, sales, or manufacturing of illegal drugs within the\nprevious seven years (ex. 7).  \nIn a follow-up interview with an agent from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) in October 2008, Applicant assured the investigator that he never sold, supplied,\nmanufactured, or grew drugs. He reiterated these assurances when he completed a\nsigned, sworn affidavit for the agent (see ex. 8).\nAt hearing, Applicant  acknowledged the statement in his affidavit, but insisted the\nOPM investigator who interviewed him told him it was not important (Tr. 91). The agent\ncould not recall rendering such advice when asked by Applicant about it (Tr. 20-24).  And\nthe agent was not asked to recall whether she ever advised him it was all right to\naffirmatively misrepresent his avoidance of drugs in the affidavit he completed. \nWithout more probative evidence from Applicant, there is not enough evidentiary\nsupport to draw any factual inferences that the OPM agent characterized his expressed\nmisstatements about his past cultivation of marijuana as immaterial. An agent\u2019s\nencouraging an applicant to knowingly falsify an affidavit about his past drug activity can\nnever be inferred without corroborating evidence or exceptional circumstances. Such\nexceptional circumstances are not present here.  Prior marijuana cultivation was still an\nissue of considerable concern to Applicant in 2008, just as it was for him in 1988 when\nhe declined to acknowledge his cultivation of illegal drugs until he was confronted by the\ninterviewing DSS agent. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding his affirmative\nmisstatements in his 2008 affidavit, inferences warrant that they were knowingly and\nwilfully made to the OPM agent to avert further embarrassment, and are not excused by\nany statements or actions by the interviewing OPM agent.\nRecords report that Applicant was terminated for cause in October 2004 due to\ncited inappropriate sexist remarks he made in the work-place to an identified female\nemployee (see exs. 8, 9, and B; Tr. 84-88, 123-26).  Based on reported complaints,\nApplicant and other employees were investigated by his employer\u2019s human resources\ndepartment for reported sexist remarks (see ex. 8; Tr. 76, 88-89, 124-28).  He received\nunemployment benefits from his state following his termination (see ex. B; Tr. 76). \nApplicant assures he learned from his experiences associated with his termination\nand consistently treats his colleagues with the utmost respect and dignity (Tr. 85-89).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s assurances are corroborated by his more recent written impressions from\ncolleagues, his performance evaluations, and his awards, and are accepted.\nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisors and former colleagues who have\nworked with him and documents excellent performance evaluations and awards with his\ndefense employers between 1977 and 1984, and between 1990 and 2005 (see exs. J, K,\nand L and; Tr. 59-61, 70-74, and 97-101). He has an enduring marriage and has been an\nactive provider for his family over the past 12 years. \nApplicant is a demonstrated active contributor to his after-school programs with\nelementary students.  He is a scout leader and is active in Church activities.  He coaches\nLittle League and is a recognized leader in his church\u2019s organized student activities (see\nex, C; Tr.  92-95, 101).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n6\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a well regarded engineer who has worked in the defense industry for\nalmost 25 years with a good record of performance. Security concerns are raised over\nhis recurrent involvement with drugs and misrepresentations over his past involvement\nwith marijuana cultivation.  \nDrug concerns\nOver a 27-year period (between 1977 and at least June 2005), Applicant used\nmarijuana and other drugs intermittently in social situations (two to four times a month)\nwith friends before permanently discontinuing his use in June 2005.  Use and cultivation\nof illegal drugs, (inclusive of marijuana) are proscribed by both state law and federal law\n(see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802, et seq.  \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s admissions of using marijuana after applying for a security clearance\nraise judgment issues and initial security concerns over risks of recurrence. On the\nstrength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d DC \u00b6 25(c),\n\u201cillegal possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to\ncontinue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue\ndrug use.\u201d\nJudgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s continued drug use after applying for\nand receiving  security clearances between 1977 and 2007. These actions reflect both\njudgment lapses and disregard of the DoD\u2019s rules and policies for clearance holders.\nApplicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by Guideline E, and are entitled to independent\ncognizance under this Guideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-\n20964, at 6 (App. Bd. April 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is additional probative\nadverse information covered by Guideline E that is not covered by Guideline H, and vice\nversa, and which reflects a recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or\nemotionally unstable behavior, independent grounds do exist for considering questionable\njudgment and trustworthiness allegations under Guideline E as well as Guideline H.\nAuthority for considering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is contained in the\nguidance provided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006 amendments. \nSo, under Guideline E, core judgment and trustworthiness concerns covered by\nD.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information,\u201d have some applicability to this case in\naddressing the security significance of Applicant\u2019s using marijuana after being granted a\nsecurity clearance.\nGenerally, though, misconduct predictions may not be based on supposition or\nsuspicion. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356\n(April1998). The Appeal Board has consistently held that an unfavorable credibility\ndetermination concerning an applicant is not a substitute for record evidence that the\napplicant used marijuana since his last recorded use, or based on his past use, is likely to\nresume usage in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (May 2004). \nBased on his own creditable testimony, the testimonials of Applicant\u2019s character\nreferences and the significant lapse of time (over five years) since his last acknowledged\nuse of illegal drugs (marijuana), Applicant may invoke several mitigating conditions under\nthe drug involvement guideline: specifically, MC \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d is disjunctive and can be applied to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant\u2019s\n\n8\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future has some application as well.\nAvailable considerations under \u00b6 26(b) include \u201c(3) an appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d\nand \u201c(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\u201d  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s recurrent marijuana over more than 20 years raises some\nquestions over the strength of his avoidance assurances, it is not enough to preclude his\nsuccessful mitigation of the issue.  Applicant\u2019s recurrent use of marijuana between 1976\nand 2002 has been interrupted by long periods of non-use, and most importantly has\nnever been more than occasional. \nApplicant has made some noticeable gains in his efforts to mitigate his past\nmarijuana use.  While Applicant\u2019s recurrent marijuana use covered a considerable period\n(over 20 years), his use was never frequent, and it was generally limited to social\nsituations after college.  Applicant may invoke several mitigating conditions under the\ndrug involvement guideline: specifically, MC \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d is disjunctive and can be applied to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future has some application as well.\nAvailable considerations under \u00b6 26(b) include \u201c(3) an appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d\nand \u201c(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\u201d  \nSince quitting drugs altogether in June 2005, Applicant ceased contact with\npersons who use drugs. Accordingly, he may fully invoke MC \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used,\u201d to the merits of his situation.  In fairness to\nApplicant, he has exhibited candor about his past marijuana use and his associations with\npersons who have used the substance. \nFor his ultimate acknowledgment of his using marijuana after being granted a\nsecurity clearance, and his ensuing commitment to cease all involvement with illegal\ndrugs thereafter, Applicant is entitled to take some advantage of two of the mitigating\nconditions of the personal conduct guideline as well: MC \u00b6 17(g), \u201cassociation with\npersons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do\nnot cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations,\u201d and MC \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or\nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s assurances that his marijuana involvement is a thing of the past are\nentitled to acceptance based on his exhibited limited, albeit recurrent, use of illegal\nsubstances (primarily marijuana), the absence of any drug activity attributed to him over\n\n9\nthe past five years, and his very strong character references from former colleagues who\nhave worked closely with him. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established independent\nprobative evidence of his overall reliability and trustworthiness with his employer and\ncommunity sponsors and understanding of DoD policy constraints on the use of illegal\nsubstances. His positive endorsements from his colleagues who are familiar with his past\nmarijuana involvement reinforce his discontinuance assurances. \nConsidering the record on a whole, at this time there is sufficient credible\nseasoning of Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts (over five years of claimed abstinence without\nany probative evidence of recurrence) credible to avert foreseeable risks of recurrent\nmarijuana use. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s drug use and judgment lapses, Applicant mitigates security concerns related\nto his drug use, drug purchases, and drug cultivation under both Guideline E and\nGuideline H. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuidelines E and  H, s they pertain to his drug involvement.\nPersonal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns over Appellant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nraised under Guideline E as the result of his determined knowing and wilful omissions of\nhis recurrent drug use and cultivation of marijuana in the DD-49 he completed in\nDecember 1984, and ensuing misrepresentations about his drug use and cultivation in his\ninterviews with DSS (in August 1988) and OPM (in October 2008). Applicant\u2019s\nacknowledgments of his recurrent use of illegal drugs and experimentations in cultivating\nmarijuana were offered only after he was confronted by the interviewing DSS agent in\n1988, and not at all in his more recent OPM interview.  By omitting his recurrent drug use\nand past experiments in marijuana cultivation, Applicant failed to furnish materially\nimportant background information about his drug use that was needed for the government\nto properly process and evaluate his security clearance application.\nApplicant\u2019s omissions are attributable to some embarrassment and concerns about\nlosing his job and clearance. His omissions, as described, reflect his conscious decisions\nto omit material information concerning his drug use history and experiments in marijuana\ncultivation while holding a security clearance.    \nWhile Applicant insists he was told by the interviewing OPM agent in October 2008\nthat his denying any cultivation experimentation in 1987 and before was not material to a\ncurrent clearance eligibility determination, his claims lack evidentiary sufficiency and\nplausibility. \nInvestigating \nOPM \nagents \nare \nnot \nknown \nto \nendorse \nactual\nmisrepresentations in their interviews, and cannot be accepted herein without\ncorroborating proof from Applicant. Neither Applicant\u2019s 1988 answers not his more recent\n2008 answers were sufficiently prompt, or voluntary, to enable him to invoke MC \u00b6 17(a),\n\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\n\n10\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant\u2019s subsequent hearing\ncorrections, while manifestly forthcoming and sincere, do not meet either the prompt or\ngood-faith prongs of MC \u00b6 17(a), as these terms are generally understood. His\nassurances are not challenged by any countervailing evidence and are accepted.\nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s DD-49 omissions,\nhis ensuing misstatements in his 1988 DSS interview and 2008 OPM interview, and his\nhearing explanations, his disclosures are insufficient to enable him to convincingly refute\nor mitigate the deliberate falsification allegations.  Questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations reflect core policy\nsecurity concerns of the personal conduct guideline (AG \u00b615). They are clearly evident\nunder the facts and policy considerations developed under this Guideline. Overall,\nApplicant\u2019s explanations of his omissions and misrepresentations are not persuasive\nenough to warrant favorable conclusions relative to the falsification allegations pertaining\nto his drug-related SF-86 questionnaire and ensuing DSS and OPM omissions.  \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s prior termination stemming from cited sexist remarks made\nto employees of his previous employer, are aged, not repeated, and are mitigated by\nApplicant\u2019s behavioral changes in the way he treats his colleagues and coworkers.  \nTaking into account all of the evidence produced in this record, unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the Guideline E allegations that Applicant knowingly\nand wilfully omitted his (a) drug purchases and cultivation attempts in his 1984 DD-49, (b)\nhis attempts to grow marijuana until challenged by the interviewing DSS agent, and (c) his\nmisrepresented prior attempts to cultivate marijuana in his most recent OPM interview.\nFavorable conclusions are justified with respect to the allegations covered in\nsubparagraph 2.f relative to his prior dismissal for making inappropriate and harassing\ncomments to other employees.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE H: (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):          FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a through 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubpara. 2.a through 2.e:\nAgainst  Applicant\n\n11\nSubpara. 2.f:                                            For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Drug Involvement. \nClearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on January 30, \n2007. On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (drug \ninvolvement). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2008. DOHA received the \nresponse on October 8, 2008, and Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nNovember 19, 2008. On November 24, 2008, and on November 28, 2008, the case was \nApril 23, 2009\n\n \n \n2\nassigned and reassigned to other administrative judges. On January 15, 2009, the case \nwas reassigned to me. On December 12, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing for January 22, 2009.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government Exhibit List was marked as Exhibit (Ex.) I, \nand copies of 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 802, Definitions, and 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 812, Schedules of \ncontrolled substances, were marked Ex. II and III, respectively. Applicant offered \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received without objection, and he testified \non his own behalf. I held the record open to afford the Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE C through E without \nobjection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel by e-mail dated January \n30, 2009 (Ex. IV). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 2, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e. After a \nthorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old business manager for a village corporation located in a \nremote U.S. location accessible only by sea or air. The corporation is responsible for \nretail sales of utilities, general merchandise, heavy equipment, and subsistence \nresources. He has held this position since January 1989. Applicant supervises 14 \nemployees and reports to a Board of Directors. His village has a population of \napproximately 900 residents. Applicant, like the majority of village residents, is a \nmember of a Native American group. Tr. 17-18, 22. \n \nHe also serves as a member of the Board of Directors, and as Vice Chairman of \nthe Board\u2019s parent corporation, a Native American corporation. The parent corporation \nhas a contract with DoD and it is in this capacity as Vice Chairman that Applicant is \nrequired to have a security clearance. Applicant has been on the Board of Directors of \nthis corporation since June 1998. Tr. 24, 27-31.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1982, and attended a community \ncollege for one semester. Tr. 23. His primary language is a Native American dialect with \nEnglish as his second language. Tr. 19. He served in his state\u2019s National Guard from \nSeptember 1985 to September 1994, and was honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay \ngrade E-5) with a Military Occupational Specialty of 11B, Infantryman. GE 1, Tr. 24-25. \nApplicant has been married since June 1987. He and his wife have four children, three \nsons, ages 21, 16 and 11, and a 10-year-old daughter. All of his children reside at home \nwith the exception of his 16-year-old son, who boards at high school during the school \nyear. GE 1, Tr. 19-22.  \n \nThe facts are not in dispute. During his background investigation, Application \nadmitted to using marijuana with varying frequency from 1986 to 2007. During cross-\nexamination, Applicant admitted using marijuana \u201cprobably twice a quarter\u201d during this \n\n \n \n3\ntimeframe. Tr. 36. He did not characterize his marijuana use as \u201cregular.\u201d Tr. 35. He quit \nusing marijuana because he wanted to \u201cchange\u201d his life. Tr. 36. Applicant stated that \nmarijuana was readily available in his community. Tr. 39. There is no evidence in the \nrecord that Applicant is drug dependent. \n \nApplicant\u2019s solution to avoid using marijuana is to \u201ckeep busy\u201d and disassociate \nhimself from drug-using associates. He described his community as one in which he is \nrequired \u201cto live off the land and the waters\u201d and his life as one of \u201ctwo worlds.\u201d Tr. 37. \nHis full-time job provides him with the economic means to cover costs associated with \nhunting and fishing. He relies on hunting and fishing to provide food for his family, his \nmother, and the elderly in his community. Tr. 37. He fishes for salmon and chum, and \nhunts for moose, black bear, brown bear, and caribou. Tr. 38. Applicant spends a \nconsiderable amount of his discretionary free time with his family gathering subsistence \nfood such as berries, particularly in the fall, in order to have enough food to survive the \nwinter. Tr. 50.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he has disassociated himself from any associates \nwho he has used marijuana with since at least October 2008. Tr. 42-47. Post-hearing, \nApplicant submitted a signed, sworn statement that he has quit using marijuana, that he \nwill not use and does not intend to use marijuana or any other controlled substance in \nthe future, and understands and agrees that any future use of a controlled substance \nwill result in the automatic revocation of his security clearance. AE D.  \n \nApplicant also credibly testified he understands use or continued use of \nmarijuana will preclude him from being eligible for a security clearance. Tr. 51. His \nfamily, position in his community, and his position as Vice Chairman on the board of his \nparent company are very important to him. Applicant\u2019s wife is a school librarian in their \ncommunity and does not approve of his past use of marijuana. Tr. 53-56. \n \nThere are no drug treatment centers in Applicant\u2019s community. The most viable \nhelp available to him or one in his situation would come from counseling provided by \ncommunity elders. Applicant described the number of elders in his community as less \nthan 10 and that the elders are given great deference within the community.  \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement from one of his \nvillage elders. The elder knows Applicant very well and counseled him on the adverse \neffects of any controlled substance. The elder described Applicant as an \u201cemerging \nleader of our village corporation and community and member of our village.\u201d The elder \nfurther added that \u201cthe whole community relies on [Applicant] as the business manager \nof [village], and community school.\u201d AE E.  \n \nApplicant is active in his church, serves on the school advisory board, was a \nformer local radio announcer, regularly volunteers for community events, and \nparticipates in wilderness and river search and rescue missions. Tr. 62-63. In his \ncapacity as Business Manager, Applicant \u201ctake[s] care of the whole community.\u201d The \ncommunity depends on him to ensure they are provided with electricity, oil, gas, and life \n\n \n \n4\nsustaining needs. If a village resident needs assistance, they seek out the Applicant. Tr. \n63. \nApplicant submitted two additional reference letters. The first is from the \nPresident of his parent corporation, who is sponsoring him for a security clearance. The \nsecond is from the Chairman of his village board. Both individuals have known Applicant \nfor significant periods of time and offered very positive comments about Applicant and \nattest to his good character. AE A, AE B.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n5\n                                                          \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n  \nUnder Guideline H (Drug Involvement), the Government\u2019s concern is that use of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. AG \u00b6 24. \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline H through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence presented. Applicant has used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 1986 to at least 2007.   \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two Drug Involvement \nDisqualifying Conditions. AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition);\u201d1 and AG \n\u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of \nDrug Involvement Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 26(b): \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation form drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d  \nApplicant has complied with each and every component of this Mitigating \nCondition, i.e. he no longer associates with drug-using associates; he has shifted his \nfocus to his work, providing for his family and recognizing their needs and the needs of \nhis community as coming first; has not used marijuana since last year; and signed a \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. Applicant \nhas also sought rehabilitative counseling from a community elder.  \nApplicant presented credible evidence of actions taken to overcome his problem, \nand established he is currently abstinent and submitted evidence he is not drug \ndependent. He is remorseful for his behavior and has initiated lifestyle changes. His \nreference letters and statements from senior company representatives show Applicant\u2019s \n \n1 AG \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medication direction. \n\n \n \n6\nwork behavior has not been indicative of his having a drug problem. He is viewed as a \nvaluable employee, who is reliable, dependable, and professional. His value to his \ncommunity and as an employee is supported by senior company officials, who know \nhim personally and professionally, and by his own credible testimony and evidence \npresented. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged the problems misuse of marijuana \nhas caused him, demonstrated remorse, and manifested a steadfast commitment to \ncontinue lifestyle changes consistent with total abstinence of marijuana or any other \ndrugs.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has been willing to do whatever is necessary to conform his behavior to \nwhatever is required to qualify for a security clearance. He has family support, stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. His family, community support and rehabilitative \ncounseling should ensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct \nattitude and commitment to remaining drug free. Considering his demeanor and \ntestimony, I believe Applicant has learned from his mistakes, and his questionable \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. In sum, I find Applicant has presented sufficient evidence \nof rehabilitation.  \n \nAlso noteworthy is Applicant\u2019s past behavior, which serves as a reliable indicator \nof future behavior. His community is isolated from the rest of the U.S. and inhabitants \nmust place considerable trust and confidence in their authority figures. Applicant is one \nof those authority figures that his family and community rely on in ways not commonly \nseen in other venues. Applicant honorably served in the National Guard for nine years. \nHe is at the forefront of all community activities to include wilderness and river search \nand rescue operations. Applicant is living a different lifestyle consistent with someone \nwho wishes to remain drug free. He is married and the father of four children, and a \nresponsible and contributing member of society.  \n\n \n \n7\n                                                          \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the law, as set forth \nin Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d2 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on May 2, 2007. On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C (foreign preference) and B (foreign influence). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6; Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and it recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 5, 2008, and requested that a \ndecision be based on the written record. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR \non November 7, 2008. Applicant reconsidered his request for a decision based on the \nwritten record, and on February 27, 2009, he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 22, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on April 29, 2009, and was \nreassigned to me on May 11, 2009, due to caseload considerations. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on April 30, 2009, scheduling the case for May 19, 2009. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nreceived without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. I held the record open \nuntil May 26, 2009 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional materials. \nHe timely submitted AE B through L, which were received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 3, 2009.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a Request for Administrative Notice (Exhibit (Ex.) \nI(A)), requesting that I take administrative notice of the summary of facts contained in \nEx. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through XIII. Without objection from Applicant, I \ntook administrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which \npertained to India. Tr. 14-15.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) \n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to India \nwere derived from Exs. I(A), and I through XIII as contained infra under the subheading \n\u201cIndia\u201d in this decision. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., \nand 2.a. \u2013 2.f. with explanations. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old director of his company, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since June 1998. Tr. 21-22, GE 1. He is a first-time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. Tr. 22. He successfully held an interim secret security clearance for \na brief period of time until it was revoked as a result of these proceedings. He received \nsecurity training from his Facility Security Office in January 2007. Tr. 60-61. \n \nApplicant was born in April 1970 in India, where he was raised and educated. Tr. \n23-24, GE 1. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics in July 1990, \nand a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Applications in July 1993 from universities in India. \nTr. 18-20. \n \nIn August 1993 at age 23, Applicant came to the U.S. on an F-1 Student Visa to \nattend graduate school. Tr. 18. He was awarded a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer \nScience in August 2006. He completed his Ph.D. course work, got \u201csidetracked,\u201d and \ndid not complete his dissertation. Tr. 17, 46-47-48, GE 1. He applied for and received \npermanent resident alien status in August 2001 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen \nin February 2007. Tr. 18, GE 1. He was issued his U.S. passport in June 2007. GE 2. \n \nApplicant married his wife, a family friend, in India in January 1997. Tr. 20-21, GE \n1. She was already in the U.S. on an F-1 Student Visa when they decided to get \nmarried and chose to have their wedding in India. Tr. 30. Applicant\u2019s wife became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in February 2007. GE 1. They have one three-year-old \ndaughter, who was born in the U.S., and is a U.S. citizen by birth. Tr. 21, GE 1. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was awarded a Ph.D. in Public Administration in May 2009 from a \nprestigious U.S. university, and currently is not employed outside the home. Tr. 22-23. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline C that Applicant possessed a valid Indian \npassport with an expiration date of April 2010. Additionally, the SOR alleged Applicant \nintended to apply for Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status before December 2008. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b.) Before the hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that his \nIndian passport had been destroyed. He also stated that as of November 4, 2008, he \nwould not be applying for OCI status. He explained that OCI status is a travel \nconvenience that would make it easier to visit family members in India. He added that it \nwas not his intent to show any preference for India and hopes the reversal of his intent \nis sufficient proof of his preference for the U.S. Once he became aware of the \ngovernment\u2019s foreign preference concerns, he took corrective action. Response to \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nSOR. Department Counsel noted in his opening remarks that concerns under Guideline \nC had been resolved by Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR. Tr. 10. \n \nForeign Influence \n \nApplicant has three immediate family members, apart from his wife and child. \nTheir relationship to Applicant is as follows: \n \nMother.

The term is often incorrectly used to refer to the whole of Indian cinema; it is only a part of \nthe Indian film industry.

AE B \u2013 H. \n \nIndia2 \n \nIndia and the U.S. have had close relations ever since India obtained its \nindependence from Great Britain in 1947. India is not hostile to the U.S., nor are its \ninterests inimical to the United States. Currently, the U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading \npartner and largest investment partner. India provides $126 million in annual \ndevelopment assistance. India\u2019s size, population, and strategic location give it a \nprominent voice in international affairs, and its growing industrial base, military strength, \nand scientific and technical capacity on issues from trade to environmental protection \nare indications that India\u2019s power will continue to increase.  \n \nIndia, the world\u2019s most populous democracy, has a federal form of government, \nsimilar to the United States, but with more authority vested in the central government. It \nhas a bicameral legislature modeled after Britain\u2019s parliament, and its members are \nselected through open elections involving several political parties. India also has an \nactive market-oriented economy, and conducts most of its international trade with the \nU.S.  \n \nThe U.S. recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to \nstrengthen its relationship with India. Since the end of the Cold War, India has been an \nadvocate of issues important to non-aligned nations, and is a member of the South \nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). During the Cold War, the U.S. \ntried to establish a closer relationship with India immediately after Indian independence \nin 1947 until 1954 when the non-aligned movement was formed. A second attempt at a \ncloser relationship was made in 1962 following a skirmish between India and China over \nthe border. Both the U.S. and India share a concern over the growth of China. Over the \npast five years, the two countries have been closer partners than anytime previously. \nHowever, there are concerns about India\u2019s relations with Iran, including India\u2019s \nincreasing cooperation with the Iranian military.  \n \nThroughout its history, India\u2019s caste system, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic \npopulation, and the vestiges of colonial domination have challenged India\u2019s ability to \ngovern certain parts of the country. India is one of the most terror-afflicted countries in \nthe world. In 2008, more than 2300 people died from terrorist incidents in India. \nTerrorism is mainly concentrated in Kashmir, a disputed area bordering Pakistan where \n \n \n2 The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I(A), I-XIII. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nradical Muslim activists are present; central India, where Maoist rebels are fighting on \nbehalf of landless laborers; and southern India, where Hindus and Muslims periodically \nclash. As a result of sometimes violent separatist movements, provincial law \nenforcement authorities and military militias have used excessive force to maintain \norder and defeat domestic terrorism. Terrorism and separatist activities are generally \ndone in furtherance of internal issues, and are most violent in limited and remote \ngeographic regions. Despite these problems, India is still an open society in which the \nrule of law is prominent.  \n \nIndia considers defeating terrorism and combating violent religious extremism as \na critical shared security interest with the U.S. In 2000, the U.S. and India formed a joint \nworking group on counterterrorism. It meets annually and is devoted to extending \ncooperation on areas such as bioterrorism, aviation security, cyber-security, terrorism, \nweapons of mass destruction terrorism, and terrorist financing. In 2002, the U.S. and \nIndia organized a cyber security forum to safeguard critical infrastructures from attack.  \n \nThere are differences between the U.S. and India over India\u2019s nuclear weapons \nprogram. The two governments continue to work closely in pursuit of mutual interests in \nsuch issues as international management of nuclear technology, and preventing the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. The Indian government buys most of its nuclear \ntechnology from the U.S., and it has an excellent record when it comes to protecting its \nnuclear arsenal.  \n \nThe growth of the U.S. and India\u2019s economic ties has been accompanied by a \ncorresponding growth in their strategic relationship. In 2005, a U.S. - India Joint \nStatement asserted that, as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology, India \nshould acquire the same benefits and advantages as other such states. In 2006, \nCongress passed the Henry J. Hyde United States - India Peaceful Atomic Cooperation \nAct, which allows direct civilian nuclear commerce with India for the first time in 30 \nyears. This agreement \u201copens the door\u201d for American and Indian firms to participate in \neach other\u2019s civil energy sector. Specifically, it enables India to buy U.S. nuclear \nreactors and fuel for civilian use. Also, it removed and/or revised several U.S. export \nrequirements for dual-use and civil nuclear items.  \n \nIn July 2007, the U.S. and India successfully negotiated an agreement on \npeaceful nuclear cooperation. This deal is more far-reaching than the Hyde Act. In \nAugust 2007, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved the agreement. \nIt has not yet been approved by the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, a group \ncomposed of countries that have nuclear energy capabilities that must approve such an \nagreement under international law. Neither the U.S. Congress nor the Indian parliament \nhas ratified the deal.  \n \nSince 2002, the U.S. and India have held a series of \u201cunprecedented and \nincreasingly substantive\u201d combined exercises involving all military services. These \nexercises ensure stability in southern and southwest Asia and have enabled the U.S. to \nget a \u201cfirst look\u201d at fighter jets that Russia designed and sold to India. More than 100 \nU.S. Special Forces soldiers have undergone counterinsurgency jungle warfare training \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nconducted by the Indian military. For the past seven years, the U.S. and Indian navies \nhave participated in joint naval exercises conducted near the Indian coast.  \n \nIndia purchases more weapons systems than any other developing country. India \npurchases the majority of its weapons systems from Russia and Israel. The U.S. began \nselling weapons systems to India in 2002. In 2007, a U.S. defense contractor negotiated \na $1 billion dollar deal with India for the purchase of military transport aircraft along with \nrelated equipment, training and services. In January 2008, the U.S. approved the deal. \nCurrently, U.S. defense contractors are competing with weapons manufacturers from \nother countries for a contract to sell multi-role, combat aircraft to India. The deal when \nconsummated \u201ccould be worth\u201d $10 billion.  \n \nAlthough the Indian government generally respects the human rights of its \ncitizens, there remain numerous serious problems and significant human rights abuses. \nIndia\u2019s human rights record has often been uneven. Police and security forces have \nengaged in extrajudicial killings of persons in custody, disappearances, torture, and \nrape. A lack of accountability permeated the government and security forces, creating \nan atmosphere in which human rights violations went unpunished. A number of violent \nattacks have been committed in recent years by separatist and terrorist groups.  \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of \nU.S. restricted, dual-use technology to India, including technology and equipment that \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign \ngovernment entities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have \ncapitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive \nU.S. technology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments \nor its use in military applications.  \n \nThe United States government encourages small and medium size companies to \nexpand their business opportunities in India. Many U.S.-based companies, including \nlarge computer service and software development companies, have subsidiary \ncompanies and do business in India. Indian immigrants are the fastest growing legal \ngroup of immigrants in the U.S. The Indian-American community is well-entrenched in \nseveral U.S. business sectors.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant held a valid Indian passport, and he \nexpressed an intent to apply for OCI status before December 2008. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b.) \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) has been raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nOne foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11 potentially mitigates \nthis disqualifying condition: \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nAs noted by Department Counsel, Applicant took corrective action to mitigate this \nconcern after being made aware of the government\u2019s concern by destroying his Indian \npassport and withdrawing his intent, in writing, to apply for OCI status. Mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 11(e) is applicable, and for reasons discussed supra, Applicant has fully \nmitigated this concern. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his parents and sister. These close relationships create a potential risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close \nexamination of all circumstances. \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions as a result of Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. The \ngovernment established Applicant\u2019s parents and sister are resident citizens of India, and \nthat Applicant maintains frequent contact with them by telephone and travel. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s father was a senior career civil servant employed by the Indian \ngovernment \nand \nin \nhis \npost-government \nemployment \nis \nactive \nin \nthe \ntelecommunications and computer field in the private sector. The burden shifted to \nApplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n \nTwo foreign influence mitigating conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplying common sense and life experience, there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, and/or obligation to his immediate family. ISCR \nCase No. 04-07766 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. \nBd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has demonstrated the indicia of ties of affection for and/or \nobligation to his parents and sister by telephone contact as well as his travel to India in \n2003, 2004, and 2006. His parents and mother-in-law have also visited him in the U.S.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is retired and is not associated with or affiliated with the Indian \ngovernment. His father is a retired senior civil servant and receives a government \npension from the Indian government. His post-retirement position as head of an Indian \nbody that develops data protection standards for commercial companies operating \nwithin India is funded by member companies and is not part of or under the control of \nthe Indian government. Although a board member of at least seven companies, only \none company appears not to be privately owned, but rather is owned by a state \ngovernment versus the federal government of India. \n \nHis sister is vice president of a privately owned advertising company and his \nbrother-in-law is a Bollywood script writer. Neither his sister nor brother-in-law is \nassociated with or affiliated with the Indian government. The record does not identify \nwhat influence, if any, the Indian government could exert on Applicant\u2019s parents and \nsister as a result of their being resident citizens of India. However, their presence in \nIndia and Applicant\u2019s foreign travel creates concerns under this Guideline. As such, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to show his relatives in India and travel there does not \ncreate security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cIndia,\u201d India has engaged in economic espionage \nand has had cordial relations with governments hostile to the U.S. Notably, the affects \nof terrorism have been felt within India\u2019s borders. \n \nApplicant denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the U.S. and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. was not challenged in this \nproceeding.  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nOn balance, Applicant has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \nthat [his relationship with his parents and sister] could create a risk for foreign influence \nor exploitation.\u201d The nature of the India\u2019s government and its ongoing intelligence \ngathering activities against the U.S. places Applicant in just this position, given his close \nrelationship with his family and their continued presence and connection with India. \nAccordingly, mitigating conditions 8(a) does not apply. However, Applicant\u2019s deep and \nlongstanding relationships with and within the U.S. warrant application of mitigating \ncondition 8(b).  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d3 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) that are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  \n \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of \nparticipation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of \nthe nine APFs to this adjudication.4 In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the \nclearance decision is an overall commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis to address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to India. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \nperson analysis. India has at times engaged in conduct contrary to U.S. interests such \n \n3 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nas illegal export, or attempted illegal export of U.S. restricted dual-use technology to \nIndia. India also has a mixed human rights record. India may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s \nparents and sister who live in India to obtain such information. Also, Applicant spent his \nformative years in India. He has visited India three times recently in 2003, 2004, and \n2006. Although Applicant has no immediate plans to visit India, he did not rule out \nvisiting India in the future. Applicant also maintains frequent contact with his family \nmembers in India. These contacts and visits are manifestations of the strong affection \nand regard Applicant has for family members in India.   \n \n \n \nThere is mitigating evidence that weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant immigrated to the U.S. when he was 23 years old, and received \nthe major portion of his graduate education in the U.S. He has lived in the U.S. for the \npast 16 years, and has one U.S.-born child. His assets in the U.S. are substantial in \ncontrast to having no assets in India. He is a U.S. citizen and U.S. passport holder. His \nwife is a U.S. citizen. His brother-in-law is a \u201cgreen card\u201d holder, who intends to remain \nin the U.S. and apply for U.S. citizenship when eligible. His ties to the United States are \nstronger than his ties to his parents and sister in India. There is no evidence Applicant \nhas ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the United States. He \ntakes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a \ndefense contractor since June 1998. The evidence contains no derogatory record \nevidence about the Applicant. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to India and the government\u2019s \nmaterial relating to India. I conclude that, in the unlikely event that Applicant\u2019s family in \nIndia could be subject to coercion or duress from the Indian government in an attempt to \nobtain sensitive information, Applicant, because of his deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the United States. Noteworthy is Applicant\u2019s \ncooperation and willingness to address the government\u2019s concern as it pertains to his \npossession of an Indian passport and intent to apply for OCI status. When he became \naware of the government\u2019s concerns, he took prompt corrective action to address those \nconcerns. I also considered his character evidence, years of loyal and honorable \nservice working for a defense contractor, and potential for future service. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Indian government or its agents might exploit or \nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s family members in such a way that this U.S. citizen would \nhave to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family members. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and preference.   \n \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d5 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.b.: \n For Applicant \n \n \n                  Paragraph 2, Guideline B: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.f.: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 21-year-old apprentice electrician employed by a defense contractor (Tr. 27). He is in a leadership position where he supervises three or four other workers (Tr. 28). He has worked for his current employer since October 3, 2005. He has a high school education, was married in October 2007, and has a 16-month-old daughter (Tr. 28-29). He has never held a security clearance. Applicant overdosed on an over-the-counter antihistamine in September 2004. He was diagnosed as suffering from depression and received treatment and counseling from October through December 2004. His doctor prescribed an antidepressant that appeared to be effective, but he stopped taking it in February 2005, because he was feeling better and his father was opposed to him taking medications to improve his mood (GX 3 at 4; Tr. 38). Applicant used marijuana about ten times between September 2004 and January 2005, while he was in high school. He testified he first used it because of peer pressure, but he continued to use it because it relieved his depression (Tr. 42-43). In June 18, 2007, after Applicant had submitted his security clearance application, he and his three associates were stopped by police because his car windows were tinted too darkly. The police searched his car and found a small quantity of marijuana. A",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines H (Drug \nInvolvement) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 27, 2007. On \nAugust 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 30, 2008; answered it on October 15, \n2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on October 20, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November \n5, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on the same day. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on November 17, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 9, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nclosed upon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 18, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 21-year-old apprentice electrician employed by a defense \ncontractor (Tr. 27). He is in a leadership position where he supervises three or four \nother workers (Tr. 28). He has worked for his current employer since October 3, 2005. \nHe has a high school education, was married in October 2007, and has a 16-month-old \ndaughter (Tr. 28-29). He has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant overdosed on an over-the-counter antihistamine in September 2004. \nHe was diagnosed as suffering from depression and received treatment and counseling \nfrom October through December 2004. His doctor prescribed an antidepressant that \nappeared to be effective, but he stopped taking it in February 2005, because he was \nfeeling better and his father was opposed to him taking medications to improve his \nmood (GX 3 at 4; Tr. 38).  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana about ten times between September 2004 and January \n2005, while he was in high school. He testified he first used it because of peer pressure, \nbut he continued to use it because it relieved his depression (Tr. 42-43). \n \nIn June 18, 2007, after Applicant had submitted his security clearance \napplication, he and his three associates were stopped by police because his car \nwindows were tinted too darkly. The police searched his car and found a small quantity \nof marijuana. At the hearing, he admitted smoking one marijuana cigarette on that date \n(Tr. 30-31). On July 10, 2007, he was sentenced as a first offender and fined about \n$160, placed on supervised probation for six months, and ordered to perform 24 hours \nof community service. His driver\u2019s license was restricted for six months. His probation \nended in December 2007. When interviewed by a security investigator in January 2008, \nhe told the investigator only his friends who were with him on June 18, 2007 knew about \nhis marijuana use (GX 3 at 5). \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on May 27, 2008, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d \nto the question, \u201cDo you intend to use narcotics, dangerous drugs, psychoactive or \ncontrolled substances, to include marijuana or hashish in the future?\u201d He testified that \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhe probably misread the question and that he does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture (Tr. 32). \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he used marijuana on June 18, 2007, to relieve \nstress, because his then-fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents were upset that she was pregnant (Tr. 34). \nHe testified he had not used marijuana since his arrest in June 2007 and he does not \nintend to use it again (Tr. 32). He believes he can now handle the stress in his life \nbecause he is in a happy marriage and has resumed taking a prescription \nantidepressant (Tr. 36). He believes he would be fired from his job if he used marijuana \nagain (Tr. 44). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana from September 2004 to \u201cat least\u201d \nJuly 2007 (\u00b6 1.a); was charged in June 2007 with possession of marijuana and was \nconvicted (\u00b6 1.b); used marijuana in July 2007 after submitting his security clearance \napplication (\u00b6 1.c); intends to continue to use drugs, including marijuana in the future (\u00b6 \n1.d); and is disqualified from holding a security clearance under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c \nbecause he is a current drug user (\u00b6 1.e). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses behavior involving ADrugs, materials, and other \nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as \namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and \nhallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 24(a)(1). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline are AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), \n(g), and (h). AG \u00b6 25(a) is raised by Aany drug abuse.@ AG 25(c) is raised by Aillegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(g) is raised by \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(h) is raised by an \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana in high school and again in June 2007 raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c). AG \u00b6 25(g) \nis not raised because he did not have a clearance when he used marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(h) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwas raised by Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2008 indicating his \nintent to continue using marijuana. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, alleging Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after applying for a security \nclearance, does not raise any enumerated disqualifying conditions other than those \nraised by SOR \u00b6 1.b, which is cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. To avoid duplicative \nallegations, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor and resolved the underlying \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E. \n \n \nAn applicant \u201cwho is an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict\u201d is \ndisqualified from holding or receiving a clearance. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c. The allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e was based on Applicant\u2019s affirmative response to the DOHA interrogatory in \nMay 2008, asking if he intended to use drugs in the future. He repudiated that response \nat the hearing, testifying that he probably misread the question. I found his repudiation \nimplausible and unconvincing. I believe it more likely that Applicant was still ambivalent \nabout using marijuana when he responded to the DOHA interrogatories in May 2008.   \n \n \nWhen Applicant received the SOR in August 2008, he realized that his security \nclearance and his job were in jeopardy. Shortly thereafter, he resumed use of \nantidepressants, and he no longer relied on marijuana to relieve his depression. He \ntestified at the hearing he had not used marijuana since June 2007, and there is no \nevidence of use after that date. He believes he would be fired if he was found to have \nused marijuana again. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories in \nMay 2008, I conclude he is not a current user of marijuana. Therefore, I conclude he \nhas refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e and is not statutorily disqualified from being \ngranted a clearance. \n \n \nEven though Applicant is not statutorily disqualified, the government produced \nsubstantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), shifting \nthe burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recentness of drug involvement. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had abstained from using marijuana for \nabout 18 months and had been off probation for about a year. However, I am satisfied \nhe did not decide to stop using marijuana until sometime between May 2008 (the date \nof the DOHA interrogatories) and the hearing. In light of his history of substance abuse \nstarting with his abuse of an over-the-counter antihistamine in September 2004, his \nregular use of marijuana until January 2005, his use of marijuana in June 2007 in \nresponse to a bout of depression, and his ambivalent response to DOHA interrogatories \nin May 2008, I conclude that insufficient time has passed to demonstrate his \nrehabilitation. Thus, I conclude the first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. \n \nThe second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) also is not established because of his \nrepeated use of marijuana. The third prong (\u201cunder such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur\u201d) is not established because Applicant continues to require medication to \ncontrol his depression and he has an erratic record of compliance with medical advice \nregarding use of prescription medications to control it. The final prong is not established \nbecause doubts remain about his current reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4). The first of these indicia is not established because there is no evidence \nhe has stopped associating with his drug-using friends. The second is established, \nbecause he is no longer living at home, is married, has an infant daughter, and now \nworks for a defense contractor. The third is not established because, as noted above, \nhe has not abstained from using marijuana for a sufficient time to demonstrate \nrehabilitation. The fourth is not established because he did not submit a signed \nstatement of intent. I conclude there is insufficient evidence \u201cdemonstrated intent\u201d to \nfully establish AG \u00b6 26(b). \n \n \nFinally, security concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). Applicant received counseling and \ntreatment after his abuse of an over-the-counter antihistamine, but he continued to \nabuse drugs, and there is no evidence of a favorable prognosis. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n26(d) is not established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.c (Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after applying for \na security clearance). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions arising under this guideline for Applicant\u2019s \ndrug involvement are AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), (e), and (g).  \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by: \n[C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by:  \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. \n \nAG 16(e) is raised by \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about \none's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d Finally, AG \u00b6 16(g) is raised by \u201cassociation with \npersons involved in criminal activity.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated use of marijuana, association with marijuana users, and \nillegal conduct that could affect his personal, professional, and community standing \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), (e), and (g). \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was arguably \u201cminor\u201d and was treated as such by \nthe court, the remaining elements of this mitigating condition are not established by the \nevidence. As noted above under Guideline H, insufficient time has passed to determine \nwhether his drug use will recur. His use of marijuana after applying for a security \nclearance casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his marijuana \nuse. He has obtained medical assistance and resumed his use of prescription \nantidepressants instead of relying on marijuana to relieve his depression. However, it is \ntoo soon to determine whether his marijuana use will recur. Thus, AG \u00b6 17(d) is not fully \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). \nThe record does not reflect whether Applicant\u2019s supervisors are aware of his marijuana \nuse. During his security interview in January 2008, he told the investigator only his \nfriends with whom he used marijuana in June 2007 are aware of his use of marijuana. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(e) is not established. Even if his supervisors were aware of his \nprevious drug use, security concerns would not be mitigated because of the applicability \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), and (g). \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cassociation with persons involved \nin criminal activity has ceased.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). There is no evidence in the record to \nsupport this mitigating condition. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a young man whose high school years were troubled by depression \nand use of marijuana. His use of marijuana while his security clearance application was \n\n \n9 \n \n \npending demonstrated bad judgment and immaturity. Since October 2007, he has \nworked in a job he enjoys. He appears happily married and willing to assume the \nresponsibilities of a husband and father. He has resumed taking his medications \nregularly. He presented himself at the hearing as sincere. He may well have turned his \nlife around, but it is too soon to determine if his checkered past is behind him.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Future reconsideration may be warranted if he continues on his \ncurrent path of abstinence from use of illegal drugs. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37 through \nE3.1.41 (reconsideration authorized after one year). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the government\u2019s financial considerations security concern.\nClearance is granted.\nOn March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 13, 2009, admitting all of the allegations.\nHe requested a hearing, and the case was assigned to me on May 27, 2009. On June\n12, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for July 7, 2009. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. I received five government exhibits, seven\nSeptember 17, 2009\n\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Board, June 17, 2005) at 3.\n1\n2\nApplicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on July 15,\n2009.\nPreliminary Rulings\nI. SOR subparagraphs 1.i through 1.k, 1.u, and 1.v allege Applicant owes debts\nto unidentified medical providers. These allegations are overbroad because they do not\nidentify specific creditors. Although an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict\nrequirements of a criminal indictment, it must still place an applicant on adequate notice\nof the allegations so that he or she may have a reasonable opportunity to respond and\nprepare a defense.  The aforementioned SOR allegations do not meet this threshold;\n1\ntherefore, I conclude that they are not justiciable.\nII. The parties stipulated that Applicant satisfied the debts listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.f and 1.o (Tr. 10). Accordingly, I resolve these subparagraphs in his\nfavor.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old single man. He graduated from high school in 2002\nand earned an associate\u2019s degree in homeland security and criminal justice in 2006 (Tr.\n22; Exhibit 1 at 5). He has worked as a security guard for the past three and a half years\n(Tr. 23). Applicant\u2019s supervisor characterizes him as \u201ca conscientious and valued\nemployee\u201d (Exhibit C). \nShortly after graduating from high school in 2002, Applicant was in a serious car\naccident (Tr. 23-24). His mother\u2019s health insurance policy, which had covered him\nduring childhood, did not provide coverage to dependents upon graduating from high\nschool, and Applicant\u2019s employment did not provide health insurance benefits (Tr. 23).\nConsequently, Applicant was unable to pay his medical bills, and soon began struggling\nto stay current on all of his bills. \nBy early 2009, Applicant had accrued approximately $15,000 of delinquent debt,\nincluding, among other things, a $1,224 credit card balance (SOR subparagraph 1.a), a\n$5,698 deficiency remaining from a repossessed car (SOR subparagraph 1.b), and\n$3,500 in medical expenses stemming from the car accident (SOR subparagraphs 1.f,\n1.g, 1.h, 1.n, and 1.p - 1.r). In April 2009, Applicant consulted a credit counselor who\nhelp him organize a payment plan (Exhibit G; Tr. 36). Under the plan, Applicant pays\n$216 monthly, deducted automatically from his pay, to the credit counseling agency (Id.;\nTr. 24). The credit counseling agency then distributes portions of Applicant\u2019s monthly\npayment to the individual creditors. \n\n3\nCurrently, the plan includes $7,061 of delinquent debt. All of the delinquencies\nexcept SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.l, and 1.w are included in the plan. The debt\nlisted in SOR subparagraph 1.w, in the amount of $668, constitutes education-related\nexpenses (Answer, Attachment 3). Applicant contacted this creditor in March 2009, one\nmonth before he consulted the credit counselor, and organized a payment plan (Id.).\nSince then he has been making $97 monthly payments (Id.). \nSOR subparagraph 1.l is an alleged debt owed to a bank for delinquent overdraft\nprotection fees (Exhibit B at 10). Applicant disputed it with the help of his credit\ncounselor (Exhibit B at 9). The credit reporting agency then conducted an investigation,\nand concluded this debt was not Applicant\u2019s responsibility (Id). The creditor then closed\nthe account (Id. at 10).\nApplicant did not address why the debt repayment plan does not include the\ndebts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, which collectively total approximately\n$7,000. He did note, however, that the credit counselor will add more debts to the plan\n(Tr. 36). He anticipates the debts listed in the plan will be satisfied by the end of 2011.\nApplicant\u2019s debt management counselor also helped him develop a budget\n(Exhibit G at 3). After paying his expenses and setting aside money for savings,\nApplicant has approximately $1,500 of remaining monthly income (Exhibit G at 2-3; Tr.\n38). He maintains a checking account balance of approximately $200 and a savings\naccount balance of approximately $100 (Tr. 43).\nApplicant has an $8,000 balance remaining on his student loans (Tr. 27). He has\nmade these payments timely since finishing school.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began shortly after graduating from high school\nwhen a serious car accident triggered medical bills that he could not afford to pay. Since\nthen, Applicant has consulted a credit counselor, developed a budget, and begun\nsatisfying his delinquencies. Payments to the credit counseling agency are deducted\nautomatically from Applicant\u2019s pay. I was concerned that the payment plan does not\ninclude two of the largest debts listed in the SOR. However, he has ample after-\nexpense monthly income to begin satisfying these debts once the credit counseling\nagency adds them to the plan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d AG 20(c) \u201cthe person has\nreceived, or is receiving counseling for the problem, and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved, or is under control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant successfully disputed the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.l, and\nprovided a letter from the creditor that indicates the account has been closed. AG \u00b6\n20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem, and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n5\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies did not accrue because of extravagant\nspending. Instead, they accrued because of his difficulty in paying medical expenses he\nincurred after experiencing a serious car accident shortly after graduating from high\nschool. Since then, Applicant contacted a credit counselor, organized his bills, and\nbegan satisfying them through a payment plan. The discipline he demonstrated in taking\nthese steps was particularly impressive given his youth.\nBecause the plan currently does not include two bills totalling approximately\n$7,000, Applicant\u2019s expectation that he will satisfy the delinquencies by 2011 is overly\noptimistic. He has ample after-expense, monthly income to handle the eventual\ninclusion of these bills into his debt management plan. Consequently, although he may\nnot completely satisfy these delinquencies by the end of 2011, he clearly has\ndemonstrated that his finances are under control. I conclude the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence is minimal.\nApplicant has worked for a defense contractor for the past two years, earning the\nrespect of his supervisor and coworkers. Upon considering the relevant disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concern. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.w:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Government Exhibit 3 at 22-39.)\nShe submits that she only uses the passport to travel to Israel because Israeli law\nrequires it.  Beginning in 2007, the Applicant had several conversations with her\nemployer\u2019s security department concerning her Israeli passport.  According to the\nApplicant, she was given inconsistent advice by the security department.  On October\n31, 2008, the Israeli government confirmed that the Applicant had deposited her Israeli\npassport with them and that she had received permission to travel to Israel using her\nAmerican passport.  (Transcript at 96-103, 131; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Q.)\nThe Applicant is still a dual citizen of Israel and the United States.  The totality of\nthe record shows that the Applicant is very reluctant to take the steps to renounce her\nIsraeli citizenship.  The Applicant\u2019s primary reasons for not renouncing her Israeli\ncitizenship appears to be that the act of \u201crenunciation\u201d would be offensive to her\nrelatives, and the fact that actual renunciation does not appear to be mandated for the\ngranting of a security clearance.  (Transcript at 92-93, 132-133.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the\nexercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant has two relatives who live in Israel.  The Applicant\u2019s uncle owns a\nsmall business in Israel.  The Applicant is close to him and they traveled together in\n2008 to the European country where he was born.  They correspond primarily through\nthe use of the telephone.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer at 3-4; Transcript at 93-94.)\nThe mother of the Applicant\u2019s husband also lives in Israel.  She is a native born\nAmerican citizen who has elected to live after retirement in Israel.  The Applicant\u2019s\nmother in law visits the United States once a year, to visit friends and family.  Other than\nthat, they correspond by means of the telephone.  (Transcript at 93-95.)  Neither of the\nApplicant\u2019s relatives in Israel have any connection with the Israeli Government or Israeli\ndefense industry.\nThe Applicant has made ten trips to Israel since moving back to the United\nStates in 1981.  The last two trips were in 1998 and 2004.  During each of those trips,\nshe presented her Israeli passport to Israeli authorities.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 22-\n39; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit P; Transcript at 90-92.)  For travel other than to Israel, the\nApplicant uses her American passport.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 6-22; and Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit P.) \n\nThe transcript incorrectly identifies this statement as being by the Applicant\u2019s counsel.  The copy of the\n1\ntranscript retained by the United States has been corrected by me to show that the statement was made by\nthe Applicant.\nThe Applicant describes such a situation involving her employer and a third country, not Israel, on pages 140\n2\nand 141 of the Transcript.\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n3\nsupport of his request for administrative notice and its attachments. \n4\nThe Applicant was presented with a hypothetical regarding the unlikely event of\narmed conflict between Israel and the United States.  She stated:\nI understand that this is a hypothetical situation.  I would remove\nmyself from a conflict of interest.  I have done that before in conflict of\ninterest situations, and I am not - - since I am above board - - both\ncountries know that I am a dual citizen.  I seriously doubt anybody would\nput me in a position to make such a choice, but I would find a way to\nremove myself from the conflict.  (Transcript at 137.)\nThe Applicant was subsequently asked if, \u201cyour choice is not to make a choice?\u201d\n(Transcript at 138.)  She replied, \u201cI think that\u2019s right.  I would remove myself from having\nto make a choice.\u201d  (Id.)   \n1\nShe confirmed this attitude on page 140 of the Transcript.  There, in response to\na question by Department Counsel, she said:\nIf the law has to do with harming an Israeli Citizen or the law\ninvolves violating a United States law, I would find a way to bow out of\nthat, and I am not shy about speaking up.  I\u2019ve removed myself from\nconflicts of interest situations before.  (Transcript at 140)2\nThe Applicant has many contacts with Israel.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to\ndiscuss the situation in Israel at this time.   Israel is a parliamentary democracy.  Israel\u2019s\n3\nprime minister leads the executive branch of the government.  The United States is\nIsrael\u2019s leading trading partner.  Israel respects the rights of its citizens; however, there\nare some concerns about Israel\u2019s detention and interrogation of alleged terrorists, and\ndiscrimination against Arabs.  Terrorism is a continuing threat to Israel, and American\ninterests in Israel.  Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close\nfriendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security\ninterests.  Occasionally, Israeli and American interests have diverged.  Several U.S.\ngovernment employees have been prosecuted for disclosure of classified information to\npersons connected to the Israeli government.  Israel has an active program to gather\nproprietary information from U.S. companies.\n\n5\nMitigation\nThe Applicant is a highly respected person in the defense industry.  Two retired\nmilitary officers, who have worked with the Applicant as contractors, testified on her\nbehalf.  They describe her as a competent, hard working and respected employee.\n(Transcript at 55, 73-74.)  Each of them made a particular point that the Applicant is\nknown to be a stickler for security rules.  (Transcript at 58, 64 and 73.)  Both of the\nwitnesses highly recommend her for a position of trust.  (Transcript at 62, 72-73.)\nThe Applicant also submitted letters and other documents.  They show that the\nApplicant is highly respected by members of the United States military and that her\ntalents have helped the defense efforts of the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B,\nC, D, E, I and J.)  In addition, she provided information showing that she is\nknowledgeable about her responsibilities as a security clearance holder.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits K and L.)  Finally, she submitted documentary information showing her\nstanding in the community, which is high.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F, G and O.)  (Transcript\nat 106-125.)\n  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, that she\nserved in the Israeli military and that she had a valid Israeli passport (Guideline C); and\nthat the Applicant has family members overseas and close emotional ties with the State\nof Israel itself (Guideline B).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has not successfully\nmitigated the Government's case, except in part.  Subparagraphs 1.c., 1.d. and 2.c. are\nfound for the Applicant as I find her traveling to Israel on her Israeli passport, as well as\nher possession of such a passport, has no current security significance. \n\n7\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nTurning first to Guideline C, the Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about her dual citizenship with Israel.  The concern is stated thus under this\nGuideline, When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe Applicant served in the Israeli Defense Forces over 20 years ago.  Under\nother circumstances, that span of time would mitigate this service.  However, given her\nobvious continuing emotional ties to Israel, as discussed in depth above, I cannot find\nthat her service is mitigated.  Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(2) applies to the facts of this\ncase: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is\nnot limited to: (2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\nThe Israeli Consulate General currently holds the Applicant\u2019s passport.  It\nremains a valid passport, even though expired, available to the Applicant on demand as\nan Israeli citizen, and has not \u201cbeen destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  However, there is some evidence that the Applicant\nwas given conflicting evidence by her security office with regards to how to properly\ndispose of the passport.  Accordingly, while Mitigating Condition 11(e) does not apply to\nthis case, under these particular circumstances subparagraph 1.b. is found for the\nApplicant.   \nUnder any analysis of the evidence, it is obvious that the Applicant would like to\nretain her Israeli citizenship.  In fact, she repeatedly stated that she would not renounce\nher Israeli citizenship.  As has been discussed, the Applicant has a close, emotional\nrelationship with the State of Israel.  While such feelings are not wrong, they do mean\nthat Mitigating Condition 11(b) does not apply to this case: the individual has expressed\na willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  For all the foregoing reasons, Guideline C is\nfound against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\n\n8\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant may only have two relatives there, but it is obvious that she has a\nclose emotional relationship with the State of Israel itself.  That is not unusual, she did\nserve in the Israeli Defense Forces and lived there for 18 years.  Nor does this show\nthat she is an unpatriotic or disloyal American citizen.  What is troubling is that the\nApplicant, though given several opportunities, could not state an unequivocal\npreference for the United States in any conflict, no matter how remote, with the State of\nIsrael.  Rather, in her own words, in such a situation she would \u201cremove myself from\nhaving to make a choice.\u201d  (Transcript at 137.)\nHer reluctance or inability to state an unequivocal preference for the United\nStates must also be viewed in the context of the Israeli government, and in particular\nthat government\u2019s history of attempting to obtain classified and other information from\nAmerican companies.  To her credit, the Applicant repeatedly stated that she is a loyal\nAmerican citizen, that she understands her responsibilities as a security clearance\nholder, and that she would not be a party to any attempt by the Israeli government to\nobtain information from her.  In fact, it is obvious that she knows and follows all security\nrules to the letter.  However, given the depth of her current connections with Israel, she\nhas failed to meet her  burden of showing an unequivocal connection to the United\nStates. \nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . or country by providing that information.\n(Emphasis supplied.)  I have also considered the information concerning the Israeli\ngovernment, provided by Department Counsel in his request for administrative notice\nand its attachments. \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given her particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\n\n9\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.  (Emphasis supplied)  Paragraph 2 is found against\nthe Applicant.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Two of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case.  First, I cannot find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nThe Applicant simply has not engaged in sufficient conduct which shows a preference\nfor the United States instead of Israel.  Such conduct might include her taking the\nactions concerning her Israeli passport set forth in Mitigating Condition 11(e).  In\naddition, she could actively engage in renouncing her Israeli citizenship.  The lack of\nany of the actions stated above make it impossible for me to find that there is little or no\n\u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. As stated earlier, Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides\nthat industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and\nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nTherefore, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this\ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to Applicant*s\nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's\nStatement of Reasons.\n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Based on the results of the\n1\nbackground investigation and his response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nSeptember 9, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthese guidelines take precedence over the guidelines currently included in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\n2\nSubsequently, DOHA issued to Applicant an undated Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nalleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG)  under Guideline J (criminal conduct).\n3\nOn January 2, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 7, 2009. I convened a hearing on June 9, 2009,\nat which the parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented seven exhibits\n(Gx. 1 - 7), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and presented one\nwitness. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on June 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged Applicant was arrested on July 23,\n2003, and charged with Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, a felony, for his conduct\non July 5, 2003. It further alleged Applicant eventually pleaded guilty to disorderly\nconduct, a misdemeanor, but served no jail time. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The government also\nalleged under this guideline that Applicant was investigated by the U.S. Army for\npossibly having received stolen goods, but that there was insufficient information on\nwhich to prosecute Applicant for that crime. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant denied both SOR\nallegations. After reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I have made the\nfollowing findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the U.S. Navy from August 1980 until\nAugust 1985. Part of his Navy service included training as a Navy Seal, which he did\nnot complete. However, after his first marriage ended in divorce, in part, due to the\ndemands of his military service, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served as a\nSpecial Forces Combat Medic from January 1986 until his retirement under honorable\nconditions in September 2003. (Gx. 1; Tr. 45)\nApplicant\u2019s military service was exemplary. His decorations included the Bronze\nStar, two Meritorious Service Medals, two Army Commendation Medals, two Army\nAchievement Medals, one Joint Services Achievement Medal, and six Army Good\nConduct Medals. In May 2004, Applicant went to work for his current employer in\nsupport of U.S. Department of State contracts in Central and South America utilizing his\nArmy Special Forces experience. (Gx. 1; Gx. 3; Tr. 70 - 71, 78)\nIn 2004 and 2005, Applicant worked in a foreign country and was responsible, in\npart, for ensuring his company\u2019s helicopter pilots were qualified to carry out there\nmission as required by his company\u2019s contract. This included having on hand a\nsufficient inventory of small arms ammunition, flares, and other mission-essential\nsupplies. Because those materials were hard to obtain through normal channels at his\nwork location, Applicant arranged with a U.S. military counterpart a transfer of excess\nammunition from a different organization. Applicant never actually took possession of\n\n Also known as \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d\n4\n3\nthe ammunition. However, in May 2005, Applicant was interviewed by an Army Criminal\nInvestigations Division (CID) investigator about his activities in this regard. The\ninvestigation was prompted by apparently illegal activities by the person with whom he\nwas working to get the ammunition. In part, the investigation tried to determine if\nApplicant had violated laws against receiving stolen property. Applicant cooperated fully\nwith the investigation, which did not produce any evidence of criminal conduct by the\nApplicant. It is unknown if his counterpart was prosecuted. (Gx. 2; Tr. 70 - 77, 81 - 85)\nApplicant re-married in June 1986. He and his wife have an adult daughter and a\n17-year-old autistic son who has required a great deal of care throughout his life. In May\n2000, they separated because Applicant\u2019s wife was having an affair with another man.\nApplicant originally intended to retire from the Army in October 2001. After the\nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he pulled his retirement request and deployed to\nAfghanistan for four months in 2002. After he returned, and while training to deploy to\nIraq, Applicant was injured and could not perform his duties. He did not go to Iraq.\nThereafter, in addition to his marital problems, Applicant became depressed about his\nphysical condition, the impact it was having on his career, and about what he perceived\nas the Army\u2019s reluctance to surgically correct his injury. In addition to painkillers, he was\nprescribed anti-depressants that may also have caused suicidal thoughts. (Gx. 3; Tr. 47\n- 54, 100 - 102)\nOn July 4, 2003, Applicant visited his wife and family at the marital residence. He\nand his wife argued through much of the afternoon and evening. At one point, Applicant\nleft to return to a cabin where he had been living. He called his wife after leaving, but\nshe hung up on him and he returned to their house. After midnight, their argument\nescalated to the point Applicant\u2019s wife had her daughter call the police. Before they\narrived, Applicant went to the basement and retrieved a handgun. Available information\nsuggests that Applicant contemplated provoking the police to shoot him.  When\n4\nApplicant appeared with a handgun on the rear deck of his house, there were four\npolice officers assembled there. One of the officers subsequently shot Applicant.\nApplicant and his wife testified that he had his hands raised with the gun in one hand,\nthe safety, on and his finger off the trigger. They also testified that he was shot in the\nback. (Gx. 7; Tr. 25 - 26, 33 - 38, 56 - 64)\nOn July 23, 2003, a local grand jury returned a true bill of indictment against\nApplicant. He was charged with Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer with a Firearm.\nTrial was delayed at least three times because the police officer listed on the complaint\nfailed to appear. Applicant eventually pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct, but was\nnot sentenced to jail and only had to pay court costs. The charge was held in abeyance\nfor three years and was ultimately dismissed. (Tr. 98 - 100; Gx. 6; Gx. 7) Applicant and\nhis wife reconciled after he was shot. Their marriage appears again to be sound. (Tr.\n29)\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n6\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). \nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n7\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\n\n5\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern raised by the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b is that\n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30)\nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, available information is insufficient to show that Applicant\ncommitted any crime. The allegation itself cites a possible charge of receiving stolen\nproperty, but nowhere in the government\u2019s information is that charge specified. Further,\nApplicant never actually received anything from his counterpart and he was not\nprosecuted for whatever transpired. He has denied any wrongdoing in this instance, and\navailable information does not show there was an allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, much less an actual offense, serious or otherwise, committed by Applicant. I\nconclude SOR \u00b6 1.b for the Applicant.\nThe government\u2019s information is sufficient to show, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, that\nApplicant was charged through a grand jury indictment with the felony of Assault with a\nFirearm on a Law Enforcement Officer. The information also shows that the Applicant\neventually pleaded no contest to misdemeanor Disorderly Conduct, and that he served\nno jail time. The only evidence presented at this hearing about what actually happened\nthe night Applicant was shot by police officers came from Applicant himself. He and his\nwife testified that he had his hands raised and did not threaten the police with the\nweapon. However, by virtue of the indictment presented, I conclude that the grand jury\nwas presented with sufficient information to support a charge that Applicant aimed his\nweapon at the officers. The fact that he was not fully prosecuted on that charge does\nnot negate the seriousness of his conduct in determining his suitability to hold a security\nclearance. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, the record requires application of the disqualifying conditions\nlisted at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). By contrast, the conduct in\nquestion is isolated, occurred about six years before the hearing, and was likely the\nculmination of a distinct period of significant personal and professional stress. Applicant\nhas not been involved in any other criminal conduct, he and his wife have reconciled,\nand he is resolving his physical problems. Available information supports application of\nthe mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.) On balance, I conclude available information is sufficient to\nmitigate the security concerns about his criminal conduct.\n\n See footnote 6 supra.\n9\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and applied the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors under Guideline J. I have also reviewed the record before me in the context of\nthe whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 46 years old. Aside from a\nconcentrated period of unusual stress brought on through circumstances largely beyond\nhis control, Applicant has been a mature, responsible adult. He devoted most of his\nadult life to military service in which he excelled, often under arduous circumstances.\nApplicant\u2019s Army requirements further strained a marriage already burdened by needs\nof his autistic child. Such circumstances resulted in stressors that do not appear to\npresent anymore. He is clearly remorseful for the conduct that lead to his arrest, the\nonly documented adverse event in his background. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s lone instance of criminal\n9\nconduct shows he is unlikely to engage in any such adverse activity. Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance is\ngranted.\n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Attorney At Law\nApril 24, 2012\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated April 30, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On October 28, 2010, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\n The Applicant responded to the SOR on November 16, 2010, and he requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to another\nundersigned Administrative Judge on November 7, 2011.  A notice of hearing was\nissued that same day, scheduling the hearing for December 13, 2011.  The Government\npresented seven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were\nadmitted without objection.  The Applicant presented twelve exhibits, referred to as\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through L, which were admitted without objection.  At this point, it\nwas determined that the assigned Administrative Judge had been a Department\nCounsel on a companion case concerning this matter.  Both the current assigned\nDepartment Counsel and the Applicant\u2019s attorney voir dired the Judge and both parties\nmoved to have the Judge excused from the matter.  The case was re-assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on January 4, 2012.  The case was set on February\n8, 2012, for hearing on February 27, 2012, by video-teleconference.  The Government\u2019s\nseven exhibits and the Applicant\u2019s twelve exhibits were reintroduced into the record.\nThe Applicant called three witnesses and testified on his own behalf.  The official\ntranscripts (Tr.) were received on December 21, 2011 and March 13, 2012.  Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 42 years old, and has a Bachelor\u2019s\nDegree in Computer Science, and is currently finishing up his last semester toward his\nMaster\u2019s Degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Software Engineer and\nis seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he engaged in conduct which\nshows questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations .\nParagraph 2 (Guideline M - Use Information Technology Systems).\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance due to\nhis noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to\ninformation technology systems calling into question his willingness or ability to properly\nprotect sensitive systems, networks, and classified information.\nThe Applicant was terminated from employment from three separate companies\nduring the period from 2000 to 2005, for violating rules and regulations, namely for the\nmisuse of government or company property, specifically information technology\nsystems, and for unsatisfactory performance.  The details concerning these\nterminations are set forth below:\n\n3\nIn September 2005, the Applicant was working for a defense contractor.  After\nlodging an anonymous complaint by e-mail against the Security Director, because he\nfelt someone was unjustly terminated, (and which given its nature could be interpreted\nas threatening management), the Applicant was told not to come to work and was\nplaced on a two week suspension.  During his suspension, the Security Director ordered\na forensic investigation of the Applicant\u2019s work computer.  The computer was located in\nthe Applicant\u2019s locked and access-controlled protected office.  The investigation\nrevealed that the Applicant had accessed pornographic web sites and pornographic\nphotos on his government computer during work hours.  The Applicant testified that\nduring his employment there, he received numerous e-mails that contained adult\npornography.   He typically opened up and viewed the adult sex and pornographic e-\nmails and photographs during work hours, knowing that he was not authorized to do so.\n(Tr. p. 59.)  He testified that the longest single visit to an adult website was 33 minutes.\n(Government Exhibit 4.)  \nThe forensic report of the Applicant\u2019s computer revealed pornographic\nphotographs, camera view (live web cam video), storage of pornographic materials,\ntransmittal of pornographic photographs and materials using his government e-mail\naccount and storage and transmittal of pornographic photos.  (Government Exhibits 5\nand 6.)\nThe Applicant acknowledged that he was told that while in suspension, he was\nnot to access his office or his computer, but that he was never told that he could not\ncome in the building.   In direct violation of this order, during his suspension, he gained\naccess to the building after hours, during the weekend to get his checkbook, and to\ncheck his e-mail in his office.  At that time, he e-mailed some non-work related matters\nto his home.  (Tr. p. 63.) .  The investigation found that the Applicant had logged into the\nsystem using his password to try to scrub the computer.  It also revealed that the\nApplicant had personal information on his sensitive computer including his bank\ninformation, an ebay, and amazon account, and a quicken bill pay program, among\nothers.  The Applicant states since his security access card was not turned off, nor was\nhe placed on a list at the front desk of people not allowed in the building he did not see\na problem with it.  (Tr. p. 87 and Government Exhibit 4.)\nThe Applicant knowingly violated his company\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d regarding\nviewing pornographic web sites.  He admits to viewing pornography at work on his work\ncomputer.  (Tr. p. 75.)  In retrospect, he realizes that this was a huge mistake.  He\ntestified that in the future, he will never look at pornographic material at work or on a\nwork computer.  (Tr. p.73.)  The Applicant contends that his work computer was\nunclassified, not on the government network and did not compromise government\nsecurity.  It was however viewed on a sensitive government computer.  As a result of\nthis misconduct, the Applicant was terminated from his job position.  (Tr. p. 95.)\nIn 2001, the Applicant was working for a small start up company.  As the\ncompany grew, there were strong differences of opinion on the direction of the company\nconcerning design and architecture matters.  The Applicant described it as a \u201cbig blow\n\n4\nup\u201d and he was fired.  (Tr. p. 79.)  The Applicant was terminated from employment due\nto unsatisfactory performance.  (Tr. p. 95.)    \nIn 2000, the Applicant was working for a defense contractor by day and\nmoonlighting by night.  During the day, if he had some down time, he would work on his\noutside work.  Through routine computer scans, the company found some of the\nApplicant\u2019s outside work on his day work computer.  The Applicant was terminated from\nemployment for his misuse of information technology resources.  (Tr. p. 95.)\nThe Applicant testified that he did not reveal his past employment terminations to\nhis present employer because he was not asked about them.  He explained that during\nhis hiring process he underwent a technical interview and was asked about the\ntechnologies he uses and the projects he worked on.  He was not asked why he left his\npast employment.  (Tr. pp. 70 -71.)  \nThree witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant, including his supervisor, a\ncoworker and past office mate, and a friend and past coworker.  They consider the\nApplicant to be a trustworthy individual who simply made a mistake in the past.  They\ntestified that if they received pornographic e-mails on their work computer they would\nhave deleted them and/or reported it to company security.  (Tr. pp. 16-21, 37-43, and\n100-104.)     \nLetters of recommendation submitted by both professional and personal\nassociates of the Applicant, including the Facility Security Manager, attest to the\nApplicant\u2019s responsible, trustworthy, and professional nature. He is said to demonstrate\na strong work ethic, honesty and integrity.  He is a top and valued performer of the\ncompany and highly regarded.  He is recommended for a security clearance.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L.)\nThe Applicant received an award when he was a summer hire computer clerk,\nfrom the Department of the Army for his contribution to the Quality and Instrumentation\nEngineering Branch during the period from July 7,1991,  through July 19, 1991  He\nreceived an On-the-Spot Cash award of $1,000.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\n\n5\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which when\nconsidered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n17.(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems)\n39. The Concern. Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks and information. Information\ntechnology systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and date\nused for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n40.(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or\ncomponent thereof;\n40.(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n41.(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n6\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\n\n7\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and misconduct, which demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in poor personal conduct (Guideline E), and that he engaged in\nthe misuse of information technology systems (Guideline M).  This evidence indicates\npoor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because\nof the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that during a five year period from 2000 to 2005, the\nApplicant was terminated from three places of employment for failing to comply with\ncompany rules and regulations regarding either the unauthorized and misuse of the\ngovernment and/or company computer, and for unsatisfactory performance.  The e-mail\nin question that was sent by the Applicant is disturbing.  From the evidence presented, it\nappears that the Applicant was at one time a hot head who did what he wanted to do,\nregardless of the consequences.  His disruptive workplace behavior, statements of\nbitterness, \nresentment, \ndisgruntlement, \nargumentative \nnature \nand \nnumerous\ndisagreements with his company management proved difficult to deal with and for some\nbecame intolerable.  His inappropriate conduct during that period of time clearly\nexhibited immaturity, ignorance, poor judgment and lack of professionalism.  \nOver the past seven years, I believe the Applicant has significantly grown up.  He\nnow appears to realize his serious mistakes of the past. He understands the importance\nand the responsibilities associated with holding a security clearance and has convinced\nme that he will never engage in this kind of inappropriate activity at work in the future.\nHe understands that government and company computers are reserved for just that,\nnothing more.  He understands that if he is to view pornography, it had better be done in\nthe privacy of his own home on his own personal computer.  I believe he also realizes\nthe importance of getting along with his management and maintaining a professional\nattitude at all times, whether he disagrees with them or not.   \nAlthough the Applicant did not reveal his past three job terminations to his\npresent employer, it appears that he was not asked about them.  During his hiring\nprocess, his employer was more concerned about his technical skills and the\ncontribution he could make to the company.  Under these circumstances, I cannot find\nthat he intentionally or deliberately failed to disclose the information, or that he\nwrongfully concealed it.  However, for future matters, the Applicant must be open, up\n\n8\nfront and candid with his past employment history if he is to continue working in the\ndefense industry with a security clearance.      \nUnder Guideline E, the Applicant\u2019s poor personal conduct reflects negatively on\nhis ability to be trusted with the national secrets.  The Applicant\u2019s pattern of misconduct\ninvolving \nrule \nviolations \ndemonstrates \npoor \njudgment, \nunreliability \nand\nuntrustworthiness.  However, it occurred over seven years ago and there has been no\nreoccurrence.  The Applicant acknowledges his mistakes, and indicates that he has\nchanged his ways. \nDisqualifying Condition 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative\nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment\nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information applies.  Mitigating Condition 17.(d)\nthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur also applies  \nTurning to Guideline M, the Applicant\u2019s misuse of the government and/or\ncompany computer by viewing pornography at work, during work hours is inexcusable\nand demonstrates extremely poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.\nDisqualifying Conditions  40.(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information\ntechnology system or component thereof, and 40.(e) unauthorized use of a government\nor other information technology system apply.  Mitigating Condition 41.(a) so much time\nhas elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.\n   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information, including witness testimony and his\nfavorable letters of recommendation.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality\nof the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole\nperson assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a willingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay properly safeguard classified information.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Savarino, Esquire \n \n \n \n \nDecision \n \n \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the \nguidelines for drug involvement and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form (SF)-86, on \nNovember 15, 2001. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n1\nJune 22, 2009\n\n \n \nOn November 7, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on December 23, 2008, in which he \nadmitted to all allegations under Guideline H except allegation 1.f. Under Guideline E, he \nadmitted to SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-references allegations 1.a. through 1.g. He denied \nallegations 2.b. through 2.d., which allege deliberate falsification of information he \nprovided on his security clearance applications. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 16, 2009, and the case was assigned to \nme on February 25, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 27, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 26, 2009. During the hearing, the \ngovernment offered six exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \npresented the testimony of four witnesses. He also offered one exhibit, marked as \nApplicant Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection. I held the record open to allow \nApplicant to submit additional documentation. He timely submitted one document, which \nwas forwarded by Department Counsel without objection. I admitted the document as AE \nB. DOHA received the transcript on March 3, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nSubparagraph 1.c. of the SOR alleges that \u201cYou used cocaine from approximately \n1995 to 2002.\u201d At the hearing, Applicant testified that he used cocaine starting in 1986, \nas he reported in his security clearance application of May 2006. In order that the SOR \nconform to the record, I amended SOR allegation 1.c. to read, \u201cYou used cocaine from \napproximately 1986 to 2002.\u201d  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, \nand the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n                                                 \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n2\n\n \nApplicant, 51 years old, earned a certificate in Data Communications Technology \nfrom a community college in 1993 (Tr. 87-88). He married for the first time in 1980. He \nand his wife separated in approximately 1992, and divorced in 2002 (Tr. 153-154). He \nhas two children with his first wife, a 21-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter. He \nmarried his second wife in 2004 and has no children from his second marriage (GE 1). \nApplicant has been employed as an engineer since 1978, and his current title is Senior \nIntegration Engineer and Project Manager. He worked for a federal contractor from 1978 \nto 2001, and another federal contractor from 2001 to the present. Both companies had \npolicies in effect that prohibited illegal drug use during the years that Applicant was an \nemployee (GE 1; Tr. 33; 50; 89; 149).  \n \nApplicant began using marijuana sometime between the age of 10 years (Tr. 73) \nand his early teens (GE 5; Tr. 90), using it on weekends with friends. He experimented \nwith amphetamines, and barbiturates (Tr. 91), as well as LSD and quaaludes (Tr. 73). He \nalso purchased drugs during this time period (Tr. 91). When Applicant began working \nfull-time, in his 20s, his use of marijuana decreased to about three or four times per year \n(Tr. 93). However, in his Interrogatory response, he noted that he \u201cmay have used \nmarijuana in college on a weekly basis\u201d and also noted that he purchased it about two to \nfour times per year (GE 6). Applicant attended college between 1983 and 1993, when he \nwas 25 to 35 years old (GE 1). Applicant also used hashish a \u201ccouple of times a year\u201d \nfrom 1971 to 1995 (Tr. 94). Between 1995 and 2002, Applicant testified that he used \nmarijuana infrequently, when he was with friends or playing sports, approximately one to \ntwo weekends per month. However, after he purchased his house in 2000, it became \nless frequent (Tr. 165).  \n \nAs a young boy, Applicant went on backpacking trips on the Presidents\u2019 Day \nholiday weekend in February (Tr. 150). Applicant and several friends continued this \nannual tradition for decades. Applicant last attended the winter camping trip in February \n2002. During these three-day camping trips, he and his friends used marijuana (Tr. 92).  \n \nApplicant used psychedelic mushrooms three times, between 2000 and 2001 or \n2002,3 during his winter camping trips. He testified that he first tried them when someone \nbrought the mushrooms on the winter camping trip in 2000 (Tr. 97-98). During a security \ninterview on August 17, 2007, Applicant stated he had psychedelic mushrooms in his \nhome freezer, that they had been there for approximately six years, and that they were \nleft over from his last camping trip in 2002 (GE 5). However, at the hearing, Applicant \nstated that the mushrooms belonged to his wife, who had obtained them from a friend \n(Tr. 105). He stated both in his August 2007 interview and at the hearing that he had \nasked his wife for several years to dispose of them, but she did not do so (AE A; Tr. 105-\n106). Applicant disposed of the mushrooms after his August 2007 interview. His wife \n                                                 \n3 Applicant first testified that his last use of psychedelic mushrooms was in 2002; but later said it was in \n2001 (Tr. 97-99). \n \n \n3\n\n \nsubmitted a notarized statement that she has used illegal drugs recreationally on rare \noccasions, but stopped in 2005 (AE A). \n \nBetween 19864 and 2002, Applicant used cocaine. The drug was available on the \nwinter camping trips, and Applicant was not certain, but believes that he likely used it \ninfrequently on those trips. However, in approximately 1995, he moved to an apartment \nwhere he met a man who used cocaine. Applicant used it \u201conce every couple of months, \nmaybe\u201d and purchased it twice from the man (Tr. 96). He later testified that his cocaine \nuse between 1995 and 2002 was, \u201cI would say on average, per year, once every four \nmonths.\u201d (Tr. 163). Although a security investigator reported in 2007 that Applicant used \ncocaine on \u201cone occasion per weekend\u201d from 1995 to 2002, Applicant called that \nstatement \u201cabsolutely incorrect\u201d at the hearing (Tr. 160), and noted that he had corrected \nthis inaccuracy in his Clarifications document (GE 5). He also used cocaine during the \nwinter camping trip of February 2002 (Tr. 97). \n \nFor the past 15 years, Applicant and his family have joined several other families \neach year for camping trips in the Spring and Fall. Some of Applicant\u2019s friends from the \nwinter camping trips also attend the family camping trips (Tr. 151). Some drug use \noccurs at these events. Appellant estimates that, each year, he used marijuana on one \nof the annual family trips, after the children were in bed (Tr. 99-100; 152). He has not \nused illegal drugs in front of his children or told them about his own drug use. He has \nwarned them not to use illegal drugs because he wants \u201cto make sure that my children \nnever did, or never would.\u201d (Tr. 100-101). He testified that he is not exposed to illegal \ndrugs on these trips anymore because \u201cEverybody is well aware, I have made it very \nclear that I'm not interested, and I will not do drugs again, and I didn't want to be around \nit, I don't want to see it, I don't want to smell it.\u201d (Tr. 103). As of the date of the hearing, \nhe had last attended the family camping trip in Spring 2008, and intended to go to the \nSpring 2009 trip. \n \nApplicant has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. On his last winter \ncamping trip in February 2002, after he had used marijuana and cocaine (Tr. 149), he \ndecided to walk on a log in the campfire. When he jumped off, he fractured his ankle, \nand later developed a severe infection in his foot. He wore a large cast, and had to self-\nadminister a strong antibiotic into a line that fed into his heart. He decided at that time \nthat he would no longer use illegal drugs (Tr. 102-103). \n \nApplicant's witness, a friend who attends the annual winter trip, testified that he \nsaw Applicant use marijuana on the 2002 trip. He knows that Applicant has not attended \nany camping trips with the group since 2002. Applicant has told the witness that he will \nnot use illegal drugs again, and has not used drugs since that time in the presence of the \nwitness (Tr. 59-61).  \n \n                                                 \n4 Applicant gave several dates for his first use of cocaine (GE 4; GE 5). It was determined at the hearing \nthat the correct date is 1986 (Tr. 155). \n \n4\n\n \nAs to his friends who currently use drugs, Applicant testified, \u201cAnd the ones who I \ndo associate with, now, know very well \u2013 they all know it, but the ones who I associated \nwith now are very well aware, as well as the rest of them, that I do not drugs [sic], I will \nnot do drugs, and I cannot have it around me, or in front of me.\u201d (Tr. 152). \n \nApplicant met with a chemical dependency counselor for an evaluation in relation \nto his security clearance (AE B). They met three times between January 29 and March \n16, 2009. During their second meeting, Applicant provided a urine sample for a \ntoxicology screen; he was not forewarned of the test (AE B; Tr. 73). The urinalysis \nproduced negative results for the presence of alcohol or any illegal substances (Tr. 69).  \n \nApplicant told the counselor that he first used marijuana at 10 to 12 years old, and \nthat he also experimented with amphetamines, LSD and quaaludes. His use decreased \nafter high school, so that he only used illegal drugs on his annual camping trip, and only \nmarijuana (Tr. 78). Applicant told her that he used psychedelic mushrooms three times \nduring the winter camping trips, two of them in 2002 (Tr. 77; 80-81).5 He also reported \nthat he used cocaine several times between January 2001 and February 2002 (Tr. 75; \n79-80). He did not inform her that he had used cocaine starting in 1995. Based on the \ninformation Applicant provided, the counselor found that Applicant did not meet the \ncriteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for substance abuse or \ndependence (Tr. 71). \n \nApplicant applied for his first security clearance in November 2001 (GE 1). He is \nuncertain of the exact date that he received the clearance (Tr. 114). However, he \ntestified that he had the clearance at the time he used marijuana and cocaine during his \ncamping trip on February 28, 2002 (Tr. 148-149; 174).  \n \nQ: But by the time you used drugs on this camping trip, in February \nof 2002, you knew you had a security clearance?  \n \nA: Yes.  And there was -- that was the only time that I have done illicit \nor illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance.  \n \nQ: Now, -- \n \nA: :And I know that that was wrong, I know it was stupid, I knew at \nthe time, and that is the reason -- one of the reasons why that was it. \n(Tr. 148). \n \nApplicant testified that he was working at a DoD site that required a security clearance at \nthe time he used marijuana and cocaine on February 28, 2002. Although he did not \nremember the exact date he began working at the site, he knows that he had a large \n                                                 \n5 It is unclear from the counselor\u2019s testimony whether Applicant reported to her that he used psychedelic \nmushrooms in 2000. \n \n5\n\n \ncast on his foot that made entering and exiting the site very difficult (Tr. 102; 182). The \ncast was part of the treatment for the injury he received on February 28, 2002. I find that \nApplicant used illegal drugs one time, February 28, 2002, after he received a security \nclearance. \n \nApplicant completed security clearance applications in 2001, 2006, and 2007 (GE \n1, 2, 4 and 5). In his 2001 application, when he was applying for a secret security \nclearance, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked if he had used illegal drugs \nduring the previous seven years (GE 1).6 When asked why he lied on the application, \nApplicant testified,  \n \nA: \u2026And when I filled out the form I absolutely did have a problem \nwith that question. And I actually asked others around me, you know, \nwhat I should do. And, basically, the consensus was go ahead and \nsay no, they don\u2019t check it anyway, on a secret. So, you know, I \nanswered no. And that was, obviously, as it turns out now that was a \nvery stupid thing to do. \n \nQ: So you thought you could get away with it? \n \nA: Yes, I guess, yes. (Tr. 112-113). \n \nApplicant he did not want the government to know about his drug use because he was \nconcerned about not succeeding at his new job with the federal contractor. He received a \nsecret clearance after submitting the 2001 application (Tr. 115).  \n \nIn 2005, Applicant's company planned to submit him for a top secret security \nclearance and access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Applicant decided \nto disclose his 2001 falsification to his facility security officer (GE 3). Applicant was \naware that the higher level clearance would require a polygraph examination, which \nwould reveal his illegal drug use (Tr. 174). However, he testified that his disclosure, \n \n\u2026 was on my own accord.  I'm the one who volunteered to be \nprocessed for an [government agency] TSSCI.  And I was well \naware that it would require a polygraph.  \n \nAnd at that point is when I decided I needed to come clean, with \nmyself, with the Government, and own up to what I had done wrong. \n(Tr. 174). \n \nApplicant disclosed his falsification about illegal drug use in a letter in which he stated, \u201cI \nwas told not to include the information and that DSS does not check or polygraph for \ndrugs at the secret level.\u201d (GE 3). On his two subsequent applications, in 2006 and 2007, \n                                                 \n6 This falsification was not alleged in the SOR. \n \n6\n\n \nhe listed his illegal drug use. However, he did not disclose on those two applications that \nhe had used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance (GE 4; 5). He testified that \nhe did not understand the question. He thought it concerned only those who used illegal \ndrugs while holding positions as law enforcement officers, prosecutors or courtroom \nofficials. He realizes now that he should have answered \u201cYes.\u201d He did disclose in the \n2006 and 2007 applications that he used illegal drugs until February 28, 2002, when he \nheld a security clearance (GE 4; Tr. 178-179). \n \nWhen Applicant worked at a defense contracting company between 1978 and \n2001, he sometimes kept surveillance equipment that was slated for disposal. He \nobtained permission to keep the equipment (GE 5). Over a period of five to seven years, \nhe sold the materials at a flea market, earning about $1,000 per year. When the \ncompany closed its doors in 2001, he asked for and received permission to keep \nadditional material. He sold some items and kept others. Applicant's witness, who \nworked with Applicant at this company, testified that it was acceptable for employees to \ntake discarded company equipment (Tr. 43). \n \nIn his current employment, Applicant also worked on projects where excess \nmaterials were discarded. At the end of a project in 2006, Applicant obtained such \nmaterials, including ladders, drills, and drywall. He gave some items to his son, who sold \na portion of the materials for a profit of approximately $4,000 (GE 5). One of Applicant's \nwitnesses, who worked for this same employer for 18 years, testified that the company\u2019s \npolicy is to dispose of materials remaining after an off-site project is completed, because \nit is more cost-efficient than returning the materials to the company. Consequently, \nproject managers are directed to dispose of the material. The witness believed the \ncompany at that point has divested itself of any further interests in the property. He noted \nthat this is the usual industry practice. His understanding is that it is acceptable if an \nemployee decides keep the material. He was not aware of any instances in which the \ncompany had taken action against an employee who had taken such material (Tr. 31-32; \n37-38).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).7 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \n                                                 \n7 Directive. 6.3. \n \n7\n\n \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest8 for an Applicant to either \nreceive or continue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary \ndecision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the \ngovernment must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the \ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate \nthe government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an \nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.9 A person who has access to classified \ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \nApplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who \nwill protect the national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.10 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nOf the eight disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 25, the following three apply:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n                                                 \n8 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n9 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n10 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n8\n\n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia;  \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant admits to illegally using numerous substances as a teenager including \namphetamines, barbiturates, hashish, LSD, quaaludes and marijuana. As an adult, he \nused psychedelic mushrooms and cocaine, and most frequently, marijuana. He \npurchased marijuana and cocaine. Applicant also possessed psychedelic mushrooms, \nwhich were stored in his home with his knowledge for approximately five years. \nApplicant was granted his security clearance in 2001 or early 2002, and admits that he \nused illegal drugs in February 2002, while he held that clearance. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 includes two relevant mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such \nas:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n` \nApplicant\u2019s last use of illegal drugs in February 2002, more than seven years \nago, is not recent. However, Applicant's use extended over a period of approximately 30 \nyears, until he was 43 years old. In addition, he used illegal drugs in 2002, after he had \nbeen granted a security clearance. The lack of recency does not outweigh the fact that \nhe used illegal drugs while he was a mature adult, and while he held a clearance. His \nconduct casts serious doubt on his reliability and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nSome mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 26(b) because Applicant avoids the \nwinter camping trips where he used drugs in the past, and he has abstained from illegal \ndrugs for a significant period. However, other facts weigh against mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n \n9\n\n \n \n10\n26(b). He maintains contact with some of the people with whom he used drugs. He \nknowingly allowed an illegal drug to remain in his home for approximately five years. \nFinally, he continues to attend the twice-yearly family camping trips where drugs are \nsometimes used and where he has used illegal drugs in the past. I find against \nApplicant on Guideline H. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to \nconsideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach \nof client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in \nthe workplace;  \n\n \n \n11\n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified answers on his \nsecurity clearance applications in 2006 and 2007. Each allegation relates to the same \nquestion: whether he had ever used illegal drugs while possessing a security \nclearance. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question on his 2006 and 2007 applications. \n \nApplication of AG \u00b6 16(a) requires deliberate falsification. Here, Applicant did not \nintentionally hide relevant information from the government. He misunderstood the \nquestion, thinking that it asked whether he used a controlled substance while employed \nin three professions\u2014law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official. He \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d because he had never held any of those positions (Tr. 132-133). \nApplicant disclosed, in his answer to the immediately preceding question, that he used \nillegal drugs until February 28, 2002, which was after he had received a clearance. If \nhe had intended to hide the fact that he used illegal drugs while holding a clearance, he \nwould not have disclosed that date. Applicant did not intentionally conceal the fact that \nhe used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, and AG \u00b6 16 (a) does not \napply. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(4) is relevant to the allegation that Applicant wrongfully \nmisappropriated materials belonging to his current and former employers. Applicant's \nwitnesses credibly testified that it is common practice for companies to order local \ndisposal of equipment and materials that remain after completion of off-site projects. \nThe witnesses were unaware of any prohibition against employees or contractors \ntaking such items. There is no evidence that Applicant violated a policy at either \ncompany by taking left-over materials that the companies had discarded. AG \u00b6 16 \n(d)(4) does not apply as to Applicant's personal use of the discarded materials. \n \n \nHowever, this disqualifying condition is also relevant to Applicant's illegal drug \nuse. Applicant used numerous illegal drugs over a period of approximately 30 years. \nAlthough he used some illegal drugs on a short-term experimental basis when he was a \nteenager, he used others, such as marijuana and cocaine, over a longer period. \nApplicant violated the law over a period of many years, even as an adult. He admits that \nused marijuana and cocaine in 2002, after he had a security clearance. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) \napplies as to Applicant's illegal drug use. \n \n \nAs to Applicant's illegal drug use, the following mitigating condition is relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n \n12\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant's drug use cannot be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c). Although a significant \namount of time, approximately seven years, has passed since Applicant last used \nmarijuana and cocaine, his conduct cannot be considered minor. Each decision to use \na controlled substance was a decision to engage in an illegal act. He made that \ndecision repeatedly over a period of three decades. The fact that he acted illegally \nbeyond adolescence and well into his adult life, when he was a husband and father, \ndemonstrate a persistent unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations that raises \nserious doubts about his trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) cannot be \napplied. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant has refrained from using illegal drugs for the past seven years, a \nsignificant period of time. However, his willingness to engage in persistent illegal \nconduct by using controlled substances for more than 30 years cannot be ignored. His \nlast use occurred when he was a mature adult of 43 years. Applicant engaged in other \nactions that raise questions as to his trustworthiness. He used illegal drugs even \nthough it was against the policy at both of his employers. He intentionally falsified his \n2001 security clearance application because he thought disclosure might jeopardize \nhis job. Although this falsification is not alleged, and is not outcome-determinative, it \ndoes go to his credibility when assessing the whole person. Finally, his willingness to \n\n \n \n13\nuse marijuana and cocaine after he received his security clearance raises serious \ndoubts about his suitability for access to classified information.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Stephanie N. Mendez, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on May 12, 2006.\nOn March 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his\napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG). \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 22, 2010, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on April 22,\n2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 13, 2010. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on June 24, 2010. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in\nevidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted nine\ndocuments (AE A-I), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the\nAugust 16, 2010\n\n2\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) On June 30, 2010. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nrelating to Afghanistan. (Tr. 16) The request and the attached documents are included in\nthe record as Hearing Exhibit I. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a and\n\u00b61.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following\nfindings:\nApplicant is a 61-year-old man who was born and educated in Afghanistan. He\nwas selected to attend an army academy, and he graduated in 1972. Applicant served\nas an officer in the Afghan military from 1972 until 1979. (Tr. 23) He fled Afghanistan,\nafter being jailed in 1979, and lived in a refugee camp. Applicant requested to come to\nthe United States and has lived in the United States since 1981. (Tr. 20) He became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1996. In 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2004, Applicant traveled to\nAfghanistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He has been employed with his current employer since March\n2005 as an interpreter and cultural advisor. (GE 1) Applicant has held a security\nclearance for approximately five years while working in Afghanistan for the U.S. Army.\nApplicant is married and has four children who are U.S. citizens. (GE 1) His wife is\na naturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 23) His father died in 1976. His mother is a permanent\nresident in the United States. (Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are\nnaturalized U.S. citizens and residents of the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother lives in Afghanistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He is in his late70's\nand is mentally disabled. (Tr. 26) He rarely leaves his home. (Tr. 30) Applicant\u2019s nephew,\nwho cares for Applicant\u2019s brother, speaks to Applicant on the phone several times a year\nto provide information about his father\u2019s health. \nWhen one of Applicant\u2019s other brothers died in 1998, Applicant went to\nAfghanistan for the funeral. (Tr. 27) Applicant returned to Afghanistan in 1999 to settle\nhis estate. (Tr. 28) When visiting, Applicant stayed with his family for approximately one\nmonth. (Tr. 66)\nApplicant\u2019s remaining brothers live in the United States. One brother is a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen who is also an interpreter in Afghanistan. The other brother is a\nU.S. permanent resident. (GE 2)\n\nApplicant has one sister who is also an interpreter in Afghanistan. His sister-in-law and two\nbrothers-in-law are also working as interpreters in Afghanistan.\n3\nApplicant has three sisters. Two sisters are naturalized U.S. citizens and residents\nliving in the United States.  One sister is a citizen and resident of Germany. (GE 2)   \n1\nIn 2004, Applicant returned to Afghanistan because his son was getting engaged.\nThe Afghan tradition is that the father of the groom makes a \u201cproposal\u201d to the bride\u2019s\nfamily. (Tr. 29) He went again in 2004, due to the engagement party. His wife and son\ntraveled with him. (Tr. 30) The trip lasted approximately one month.\nIn 2005, Applicant attended his son\u2019s wedding in Afghanistan. (GE 3) As was the\ncustom, the bride\u2019s family invited the guests and Applicant\u2019s family paid for the\ncelebration. At the wedding there were many guests, including one of Applicant\u2019s former\nmilitary colleagues. Applicant had the command\u2019s permission to attend the wedding. (Tr.\n68)\nApplicant has no property in Afghanistan. He has no desire to permanently return\nto the country. Applicant had a small bank account in Afghanistan to provide for his son\u2019s\nfiancee. Since they are now married and living in the U.S., the account is closed. (Tr. 31)\nApplicant owns a home in the United States.\nAt the hearing, Applicant was passionate about his feelings for the United States.\nHe related that he has worked very hard to be a bridge between coalition forces and the\nAfghan government. He would like to bring both sides to a peace or friendship table. His\ngoal is to improve communication between the two countries. (Tr. 102) As part of his\ndaily work, Applicant has business meetings with the police department, Afghan Army\ndepartment and Afghan intelligence. (Tr. 38)\nApplicant was candid in answering questions about his contacts with former\ncolleagues from his time in the military academy or in the Army. When Applicant moved\nto the United States he had no contact with them. (Tr. 82) However, he did see them on\nthe street at times when he visited Afghanistan before his interpreter position with the\nU.S. Army. He was credible in his testimony that he did not maintain regular contact with\nthem. He also explained that he sees one of them as part of his work with the U.S. Army\nduring meetings. He explained that naturally when someone who has known him from\nhis early years in Afghanistan sees him they say hello. He acknowledged that many\ntimes he does not even recognize them. (Tr. 149) He also tried to explain that the\neducated community in Afghanistan is small and everyone knows everyone. He has\nreceived telephone calls once or twice from one former military colleague who he sees at\nbusiness meetings when something occurs that might need to be communicated to his\nArmy command. (Tr. 101)  \nSince March 2005, Applicant served as an interpreter/cultural advisor for the\nSpecial Operations Task Force-Afghanistan and Combined Joint Special Operations\n\n4\nTask Force-Afghanistan. (AE A) He remained in his position until he returned to the U.S.\nin January 2010. He resides on U.S. military installations when he works in Afghanistan.\nHe does not leave the compound except with permission. (GE 3). However, as part of his\nposition, he sees former military colleagues in meetings. (Tr. 33) His one brother who\nlives in Afghanistan did come to the gate of Applicant\u2019s base to see him. (Tr. 129)\nApplicant is not allowed to walk freely on any city streets in Afghanistan. (Tr. 146)\nApplicant has been viewed as an invaluable member of the team and most important as\na friend to all members of the Operations Detachment. (AE B)\nApplicant asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and love for his work with the Army\n(AE A). He worked long hours for six days a week. He went on missions with the U.S.\nArmy. He has willingly put himself in danger every day for almost five years in order to\nhelp the United States. Applicant emphasized that he would never betray the United\nStates. He wants to \u201csacrifice his life and his family\u2019s life for the United States.\u201d (Tr. 38)\nApplicant is proud to be a first generation American. He wants to support the U.S. \u201cby his\nblood.\u201d (Tr. 102)\nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant breached any security policies or\nprocedures while holding a security clearance in Afghanistan. He has alerted his\ncommand of his travels and contacts in Afghanistan. He has letters of appreciation for\nhis work in Afghanistan (AE A-H).\nApplicant disclosed in his 2009 DOHA interrogatories the nature and extent of his\nextended family. He has cousins, aunts and uncles who reside in Germany. His wife,\nwho is also employed as an interpreter in Afghanistan, has extended family in\nAfghanistan. Applicant has little or no contact with them. He does know that his wife has\nfamily members (sister and husband) who are serving as interpreters in Afghanistan. (Tr.\n132) \nA Special Forces major commanding a unit in Afghanistan recommends Applicant\nfor continued service. The major worked closely with Applicant during an eight month\ncombat rotation in Afghanistan. During that time, he writes that Applicant is \u201cwithout\ndoubt the most trustworthy and patriotic individual he has had the pleasure of working\nwith.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \u201cperformance while serving with the United States Special Forces from\nJuly 2009 through January 2010 was superlative.\u201d (AE G)\nThe major described Applicant\u2019s contributions to mission accomplishment by\nstating:\nApplicant served as the unit Commander\u2019s personal interpreter and\nCultural Advisor. In this capacity, he personally liaised with numerous\npolitical and military officials within the Government of the Islamic Republic\nof Afghanistan. As part of this liaison, he would engage these individuals in\norder to gain concurrence with key initiatives, mitigate Anti-Afghan Forces\u2019\nPropaganda and/or pass critical information to key leaders. The end result\nof his work was that the unit and subsequently coalition force commanders\n\n5\nbuilt and or maintained close personal relationships with Afghan\npersonalities who directly shaped the military and political environment of a\nparticular province in Afghanistan. \nApplicant\u2019s success in the endeavor was evident during the AAF\u2019s\nrelatively ineffective Summer Campaign. Applicant\u2019s wise counsel,\nunwavering dedication and tireless service was an integral part of the unit\u2019s\nability to disrupt the AAF\u2019s propaganda machine while allowing the unit and\ncoalition forces the opportunity to seize the offensive in the information\noperations arena. The impact of this feat was that the unit enjoyed\noperational freedom of action to defeat the enemy on the battlefield while\nleveraging his influence with local, provincial and national leaders to ensure\ntheir support. Applicant\u2019s performance in this capacity was absolutely\nbrilliant and his loyalty beyond reproach.\nApplicant presented another 2010 recommendation from a Special Forces major\nwho commands a unit with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. (AE H) The major supports\nApplicant for retention of his security clearance. According to the major, Applicant\u2019s\nprevious experience as a former Afghan military officer provides him with an immense\nknowledge base. This network easily allows Special Forces operators to execute key\nleader engagements which are crucial to their operational success in Afghanistan.\u201d\nFor over four years, Applicant has selflessly served as a linguist in support\nof United States Special Forces units in Afghanistan. He is an expert in\ntranslating both written and spoken Persian-Dari and Pashtu. The scope of\nhis responsibilities range from translating messages and coordinating\nmeetings with high profile indigenous leadership to gathering sensitive\ninformation. He has a tireless work ethic and is ready 24 hours a day where\nhe is always prepared for meetings or combat patrols.\nIn 2009, Applicant was recommended for increased responsibility as a Category\nIII Interpreter, after serving for over four years as a Category II Interpreter in Afghanistan.\nAccording to another Special Forces major who commands a unit in Afghanistan,\nApplicant has faithfully and conscientiously assisted Special Forces Operational\nDetachments Alpha and Bravo with exemplary translations and assistance in Advanced\nSpecial Operations; significantly assisting in the overall success of Operation Enduring\nFreedom-Afghanistan.

His\nprofessionalism and maturity make him the lead interpreter for our Fire\n\n6\nBase in all interactions with local power brokers and members of the\nGovernment of Afghanistan. Applicant is greatly respected by all members\nof our Special Forces Detachments and by the entire community. \nApplicant\u2019s Assistant Detachment Commander commended Applicant\u2019s work in\nAfghanistan in 2006. He worked with Applicant on a daily basis and found him to be one\nof the most important assets to the mission. (AE E) Applicant not only possesses\nlanguage and dialect skill but his knowledge of cultural nuances is unique. The\ncommander noted that \u201cApplicant has a unique ability to gather information from\nindividuals whom would have rather not given the information to a foreigner.  Applicant\nhas a distinct ability to quickly comprehend difficult tasks. (AE E)\nApplicant\u2019s linguist manager, a master sergeant with the U.S. army, reports\nApplicant has served as an integral member of the Special Operations Task Force,\nCombined Joint Special Operations Task Force - Afghanistan since March 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s manager vouches for the professionalism and dedication of Applicant\u2019s work.\nHe is considered to be among the best and most trusted linguists.

(AE I) He was also\nawarded several command coins which he brought to the hearing. Applicant received\nthem for meritorious service over the years. (Tr. 98)\nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Afghanistan set forth in the\nHearing Exhibits, including the fact that Afghanistan has been an independent nation\nsince August 19, 1919, after the British relinquished control. A monarch ruled from 1919\nuntil a military coup in 1973. Following a Soviet-supported coup in 1978, a Marxist\ngovernment emerged. In December 1979, Soviet forces invaded and occupied\n\n7\nAfghanistan. Afghan freedom fighters, known as mujaheddin, opposed the communist\nregime. The resistance movement eventually led to an agreement known as the Geneva\nAccords, signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States, and the Soviet Union which\nensured Soviet forces withdrew by February 1989.\nThe mujaheddin were not a party to the negotiations for the Accords and refused\nto accept them. As a result civil war continued after the Soviet withdrawal. In the mid\n1990's, the Taliban rose to power largely due to the anarchy and warlordism that arose\nafter the Soviet withdrawal. The Taliban sought to impose an extreme interpretation of\nIslam on the entire country and committed massive human rights violations. The Taliban\nalso provided sanctuary to Osama BinLaden, Al Qa\u2019ida, and other terrorist organizations.\nAfter the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, demands to expel BinLaden and\nhis followers were rejected by the Taliban. U.S. forces and a coalition partnership\ncommenced military operations in October 2001 that forced the Taliban out of power by\nNovember 2001. A new democratic Government took power in 2004. Despite progress\nmade since the Taliban was deposed, Afghanistan still faces many daunting challenges.\nAmong these challenges are: defeating terrorists and insurgents, recovering from over\nthree decades of civil strife; and rebuilding a shattered physical, economic, and political\ninfrastructure.\nThe Taliban, al-Qa\u2019ida, other insurgent groups, and anti-Coaliton organizations\ncontinue to operate in Afghanistan, resulting in numerous attacks and deaths. Insurgents\nhave targeted non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Afghan journalists, government\nworkers, and UN workers. Instability along the Pakistan-Afghan frontier continued to\nprovide al-Qa\u2019ida with leadership mobility and the ability to conduct training and\noperational planning, targeting Western Europe and U.S. interests in particular. Kabul, in\nparticular has seen a rise in militant attacks, including rocket attacks, vehicle borne\nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs), and suicide bombings.\nAt this time, the risk of terrorist activities remains extremely high. The country\u2019s\nhuman rights record remains poor and violence is rampant. According to recent reports\nfrom the U.S. Department of State, insurgents continue to plan attacks and kidnappings\nof Americans and other Western nationals. Travel warnings are ongoing. Overall, the\nState Department has declared that the security threat to all American citizens in\nAfghanistan remains critical as no part of Afghanistan is immune from violence.\nThe United States supports the efforts of the Afghan Government to establish,\na vibrant civil society, one that emphasizes democratic principles through a\nrule of law and creates accountable and transparent forms of government.\nThe United States and its international partners remain committed to\nhelping Afghans realize their vision for a country that is stable, democratic,\nand economically successful, and to an Afghan Government committed to\nthe protection of women\u2019s rights, human rights, and religious tolerance.\n\n8\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon an applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination of the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant has\nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify an applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to an applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\n\n9\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nApplicant has a brother who is a citizen and resident of  Afghanistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.a).\nApplicant traveled to Afghanistan in at least 1998, 1999, 2000, and twice in 2004. (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b). The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. He is in his mid\n70s and mentally disabled. He is not employed. Applicant maintains some contact with\nhim through his nephew several times a year by telephone. He saw him when he\nattended a funeral for another brother in 1998 and again in 2000. Applicant\u2019s\nconnections to his brother in Afghanistan could create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween his security obligations and his desire to help him, only in a situation wherein he\nwas taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if Applicant did not cooperate.\nNone of them have any government connections or other position in which they could\notherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information or technology. Applicant did\nnot maintain any contact with any former colleagues when in the United States.\nHowever, under either disqualifying condition, security concerns could arise in\nconnection with the potential that hostile forces might seek protected information from\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005).\n2\n10\nApplicant by threatening harm to his family member in Afghanistan. Based on this\nevidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) are raised.\nBefore his work as an interpreter, Applicant traveled to Afghanistan in 1998, 1999,\n2000, and 2004. He was there in 1998 and 1999 for his brother\u2019s funeral and to settle his\nestate. He visited his older brother in 2000. The visit to his brother in 2000 is\nincorporated into AG \u00b6 1.a and has no independent security significance.  \n2\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\n\n11\nApplicant has been in the United States since 1981, and he has been a U.S.\ncitizen since 1996. His wife and children are U.S. citizens. His mother is a resident of the\nUnited States. His father is deceased. His in-laws are citizens and residents of the\nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s other brothers and sisters do not live in Afghanistan and are\ncitizens of the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s work as an interpreter and cultural advisor supported the U.S. military\nmission in Afghanistan, not the work of those who seek to destroy the growing\ndemocracy in Afghanistan. The new Afghanistan government relies upon the U.S. for\nsupport, both financially and militarily, as it moves forward with a new form of\ngovernment. While Afghanistan\u2019s human rights record under the Taliban was very dismal\nand serious problems continue, its human rights record is slowly improving under this\ngovernment. Since working as an interpreter with the Army for five years, neither\nApplicant nor his brother has been pressured by any organization to provide any type of\ninformation, classified or otherwise, about the United States.\nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this\nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of this\ncase, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nis not substantial. Applicant has significant ties to the United States and few ties to\nAfghanistan. Except for his older brother, his other siblings do not live in Afghanistan. All\nbut one sister are citizens and residents of the United States. One sister is a citizen and\nresident of Germany. Applicant\u2019s children are United States citizens. His mother is a\nresident of the United States as well as his in-laws. His wife is a citizen who is also an\ninterpreter in Afghanistan. Her brother and his wife are interpreters in Afghanistan.\nApplicant has no financial or property interests in Afghanistan. He wants to help the\nUnited States in its role in the redevelopment of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s ties with the\nU.S. are much stronger than his ties with Afghanistan. The Army holds his work as a\ntranslator and cultural advisor in high regard. He provided more than language\ninterpretation skills. He explained nuances and practices which greatly assisted the\nmilitary in accomplishing its mission. During his time in Afghanistan, he worked very hard\nto help the Army. He developed a high level of trust with the Army and the Afghan locals.\nApplicant spoke about his undivided loyalty to the United States. Based on his\nrelationship and loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict\nof interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States since 1981, after\nfleeing, and did not return to Afghanistan until his brother\u2019s funeral and to settle his\nestate. He owns property in the United States. He has worked in the United States for\nmany years. He has endured dangerous conditions in Afghanistan on behalf of the U.S.\nArmy.  He has held a security clearance without any security violations. He credibly\ntestified that he would report someone to the United States government if asked about\nclassified information. There is no evidence that he has connections or contact with any\npeople other than his brother or the former military colleagues he sees as part of his job\nwith the Army in Afghanistan. I find Applicant has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in America that he can be expected to resolve any potential\n\n12\nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. He has established application of AG \u00b6\n8(b).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole-person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the\nU.S. relative to his or her ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.;\nand, many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7\n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Certain circumstances weigh against\nApplicant in the whole person analysis. First, Applicant has an older brother who still\nlives in Afghanistan. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, could attempt to use\nApplicant\u2019s brother to obtain information. Second, he was educated in Afghanistan and\nserved as an officer in the Afghan military. Third, he has some contact with his older\nbrother. Fourth, he traveled to Afghanistan after he became an interpreter when he\nasked for the hand of a bride for his son. In 2005, he attended the wedding in\nAfghanistan and among the guests was a former military colleague. \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security\nclearance. Applicant fled Afghanistan after being jailed in 1979. He lived in a refugee\ncamp. Applicant wanted to come to the United States. He is a mature person, who has\nlived in the United States since 1981 , and has been a naturalized citizen since 1996. He\nhas a strong sense of patriotism toward the United States, as witnessed by his\ndedication and work with the U.S. Army. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any\naction that could cause potential harm to the United States. His military supervisors, who\n\nISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007).\n3\n4\nI conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. Assuming\na higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under AG 8 do not\napply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing alone is sufficient\n13\nwork with him daily in a war zone, praised his work in the cause of freedom in\nAfghanistan. After fleeing in 1979, he never returned until his brother\u2019s funeral. He has\nestablished his life in the United States. He now owns property in the U.S.\nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked under dangerous conditions in\nsupport of the national defense. He credibly testified that he would report any attempt to\nuse his family members to coerce him to reveal classified information. The Appeal Board\nhas held that \u201cgenerally, an applicant\u2019s statements, by themselves, as to what he [or she]\nwould do in the face of threats by a foreign government or entity are entitled to little\nweight. On the other hand, an applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the\nUnited States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant in a\nGuideline B case.\u201d3\nApplicant held a security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. Army without\nindication that he breached security policies or procedures. He served the United States\nin a dangerous, high-risk situation and his character references establish his significant\ncontributions to U.S. national security. While contribution to a company is not normally to\nbe considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case.\nNo. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006):\nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s\nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations\nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or\nextenuating the security concerns raised by applicant\u2019s more immediate\ndisqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g. ISCR  Case. No. 01-\n03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No 02-10113 at 4 (App.\nBd. Mr. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30,\n2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that general\nrule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible,\nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and\nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances\nin which the applicant made a significant contribution to the nation\u2019s\nsecurity. See. e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006).\nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s\nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report to a\nforeign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   The complicated state of affairs in\n4\n\nto support approval of a security clearance in this case.\n14\nAfghanistan places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that\nhis foreign family members do not pose an unacceptable security risk.  He has met that\nburden. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 6, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. The Guideline E allegations were withdrawn\nat the hearing.  On April 7, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\n\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2001.  The\npetition was dismissed in 2003.  The reason for the bankruptcy filing was Applicant\u2019s having fallen\nbehind in his mortgage payments.  His in-laws subsequently purchased the house and assumed the\npayments.  Applicant has numerous other delinquent debts for such things as consumer purchases,\nloans, etc.  Applicant states that his financial problems arose due to his \u201cirresponsibility.\u201d  Decision\nat 3.  Applicant\u2019s annual salary is $52,000 and his wife\u2019s is $32,000.  The Judge concluded that, as\nApplicant has been employed for over four years without resolving most of his debts, \u201che has failed\nto act responsibly\u201d in regard to them.  Id. at 5.  \nIn support of his appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nwhich the Board cannot consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or\nconsidered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).\nApplicant contends that certain government exhibits assert facts that are not true.  Even if Applicant\nis correct, he has provided no basis to conclude that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are erroneous or that\nhe mis-weighed the evidence.  (See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, explaining the meaning of substantial\nrecord evidence; and  ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 29,\n2007. On November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant\nunder Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApril 7, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 20, 2008 and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\nand I received the case assignment on January 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 3, 2009, for a hearing on February 19, 2008. It was amended on\nFebruary 9 for a February 18, 2009, hearing and convened as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered six exhibits (Exhs. 1-6) that were admitted\nin evidence without objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits (Exhs. A and B) that\nwere admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 26, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to\nkeep the record open until March 6, 2009, to submit additional evidence. A post-hearing\nsubmission was received within the specified time after the conclusion of the hearing. It\ncontained two separate letters of support from his supervisor and a colleague (Exhs. C -\n1 and 2). The government had no objection to the submission and the documents were\nadmitted in evidence without objection.\nProcedural Rulings\nAt the opening of the hearing, the government moved to withdraw the allegations\nunder Guideline E, Applicant had no objection and the motion was granted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all of the 22 allegations in the SOR concerning\na Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2001 and delinquent debts of over $30,000. Two of them\nmay be duplicates. He attached a statement as a part of his answer. He denied that the\nallegations showed that he was at risk for committing illegal acts, and breaching\nnational security. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an\nelectronic technician since March 2008. for his present employer He served nine years\nin the Marine Corps between 1995 and 2004. He was unemployed for four months\nbefore obtaining work in 2004 for another defense contractor. He worked there in a\nsimilar position until his present employment. He does not have a college degree but\nhas accumulated enough hours that he will have one in a year. He has been married for\n13 years and has two teen age children. \nIn 2001, while on active duty, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy which\nwas dismissed in 2003 by the trustee (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). The principal reason for the\nbankruptcy was the purchase of a home from which he and his family moved when he\nre-joined the Marine Corps. He and his wife let his parents-in-law use the house and\npay no rent since they had very little income. The result was that Applicant fell behind\non mortgage payments of $450 per month since he was paying for his former home and\nhis present home. His parents-in-law later became employed and also became eligible\nfor social security payments. They were then able to buy the house they occupied and\nassume the mortgage payments. The alleged $8,572 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.r.) disputed by\n\n3\nApplicant arose from this transaction. While it may have once been owed to the\nmortgagee, his parents-in-law assumed any deficient mortgage payments when they\npurchased the house from him. \nThe debts alleged in the SOR arose from various accounts. One is for a cell\nphone in the amount of $856 on which no action has been taken (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). It may be\nduplicated in another account listed for over $900 about which he has no other\ninformation. He has had no contact with the creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.n.). The next debt is for a\nbig screen TV in the amount of $8,254. He forgot about this debt. He believes it may\nhave been repossessed as it now shows on his credit report as owing $3,000 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c.). Two debts totaling over $5,000 are for military loans now charged off (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d.\nand e.). One debt is to an animal hospital for treatment of his dog for $183 which he\nintended to pay the day following the hearing (SOR \u00b6 1.f.). He has seven medical bills in\ncollection for varying amounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 g.,h.,l.,o.,p.,t., and u.). One debt is for the\npurchase of tires for over $1,000 in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.m.). Four debts are credit card\nrelated about which he has little information (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 I., j.,k.,and s.). Two other alleged\ndebts are for traffic fines imposed by the city where he once lived 200 miles from where\nhe now lives. Two of them may be duplicates (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q. and v.). He needs to go to\ncourt in that city to resolve the debts but has not done so (Tr. 30-59). \nApplicant has settled one debt of $142 for a returned check issued by his wife\nthat was not on the SOR (Exh. A). Two other small debts for $14 and $42 have been\npaid to a collection agency but do not appear to be on the SOR. The first may be a\nportion of the animal hospital debt referenced above (Exh. B). The collection letter also\nlisted several other debts four of which are medical debts that appear to be part of the\nseven noted above. He intends to pay the collection agency as funds are available. \nApplicant was raised in a family that provided him with funds when he needed\nhelp, paid his bills in college, and at other times. He acknowledges that his current\nfinancial situation arose because of his \u201cirresponsibility\u201d (Tr. 67), and \u201cbad judgment\u201d\n(Tr. 15). Although he had several delinquent medical bills, no one is very large and\nthere is no evidence that they are the proximate cause of his indebtedness.  \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his employment is approximately $52,000. His\nwife is employed and her annual salary is approximately $32,000. He had a 401(k)\naccount of $4,000 through his employer but withdrew it in the hope of making a down\npayment on a home. However, he discovered that his credit rating was too low to do so.\nHe now intends to use the funds to pay some of his debts. \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors and a colleague for his work ethic,\ndedication to accomplishing the mission of his employer, and willingness to go beyond\nthe requirements of his job (Exhs. C-1 and 2).. He has held a security clearance since\nhis military service. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d\nApplicant did incur substantial delinquent debts and was the subject of two federal\ntax liens and a home foreclosure. Thus, the conditions required were established by the\ngovernment sufficient to raise a security concern. \nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the\nsecurity concern may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Although he had some medical\nexpenses, and several months of unemployment when he left active duty, there is no\nindication that these factors were the cause of his indebtedness. He has now been\nemployed for over four years with little resolution of most of his debts. Thus, I conclude\nthat he has failed to act responsibly and the mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(d) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. From\nthe lack of evidence presented to establish this mitigating condition, it is not applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He has provided evidence of a\nreasonable basis for disputing two of four allegations as duplicates but two are still\noutstanding. He has established a reasonable answer to the allegation relating to his\nmortgage payments on his former home, the largest of his debts. This mitigating\ncondition is applicable to those three debts.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant is a mature adult with significant responsibility in his work for which he is\nhighly regarded. His effort to help his parents-in-law was commendable but the problems\narising from that effort were resolved several years ago. The present debts arose several\nyears ago, and very little has been done to resolve them until recently. He acknowledges\nthat the debts arose and have not been resolved through his own lack of responsibility.\nHe is an impressive young man who has considerable potential and has sufficient\nincome to begin a program to resolve the debts. There is no reason to think he would\ncompromise national security but his actions to date to resolve his financial problems do\nnot meet the minimum requirements under the guideline to justify a grant of a security\nclearance. Thus, it is premature to grant him a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: \n Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.-p.: \n Against applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.q. and r.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.s.-v.: \n Against Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied.\nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in an evidentiary\nruling; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial record evidence;\nwhether the Judge mis-weighed the record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of\nthe pertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a Government\ncontractor, working in the telecommunications field.  He previously served on active duty with the\nArmy from 1979 to 1986.  As a contractor employee he has deployed to combat zones in support of\nU.S. military objectives.\nHe has used marijuana and hashish \u201cintermittently\u201d over a period of 30 years.  He began\nsmoking marijuana in high school.  He smoked hashish in 1982 and 1985, while in the Army.  Also\nin 1985, he was arrested by police in a foreign country for purchasing hashish.  Applicant attempted\nto flee, but he was apprehended.  He received punishment under Article 15, UCMJ,  for resisting\n1\narrest and wrongful possession of hashish.  He was barred from reenlisting in the Army.  When\nsubsequently asked, during a security clearance interview, if he intended to use illegal drugs in the\nfuture, Applicant replied \u201cnot only no, but hell no.\u201d  Decision at 3. \nIn 1992 Applicant used hashish more than once.  In a 2000 security clearance interview he\ndisclosed the hashish use but stated that he had no intention of using illegal drugs in the future.  In\nMarch 2004 Applicant found marijuana in the apartment of his recently deceased brother.  He\nsmoked some of it.  The following September, while traveling in Europe, Applicant purchased\nhashish in a country in which the sale was legal.  He attempted to enter another country, in which\nthe sale and possession of hashish were illegal.  He was arrested at the border and charged with\npossession of hashish.  He subsequently paid a fine.\nOn a 1986 security clearance application (SCA) Applicant failed to disclose his prior hashish\nuse and his 1985 arrest for purchasing the drug.  On a 2006 SCA he failed to disclose his drug related\narrests and his 2004 episode of drug use.  He omitted this information from the SCAs because of\nconcerns over his job.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his work ethic, his leadership qualities, and his\nmeticulous handling of classified information.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to admit into evidence the results of a test\nof his urine performed by a civilian laboratory, which was negative for illegal drugs.  The record\ndemonstrates that the Judge denied this document because it was written in a foreign language.\nDecision at 2.  However, he did admit the result of a later negative test by the same laboratory, which\n\nFor example, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he had responded \u201cnot no, but hell no\u201d to a question\n2\nabout his intention for future drug use.  Applicant demonstrates that this response was actually to a question by the\ninvestigator regarding the 1985 arrest for purchase of hashish.  The question was \u201cIf you had to do it over again, would\nyou?\u201d  Government Exhibit 6, Applicant Statement, September 11, 1987.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s characterization of\nApplicant\u2019s response is error.  However, this error is de minimis, because, in the same exhibit, Applicant unequivocally\nstated that he would not use illegal drugs in the future, a vow he more than once failed to uphold.  Accordingly, the Judge\ndid not err in evaluating Applicant\u2019s most recent promise not to use drugs in light of his prior similar broken promises.\n \nhad been translated into English.  Under the circumstances, there is no error in the Judge\u2019s ruling.\nSee ISCR Case No. 00-0433 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2001) (The Board will overturn a Judge\u2019s\nevidentiary rulings if they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law).  \n Applicant challenges several of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  After examining the record,\nhowever, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based upon\nsubstantial record evidence.  Even if the findings contain errors, they are harmless.   See ISCR Case\n2\nNo. 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR\nCase No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Applicant cites to other Hearing Office cases by the\nsame Judge, in which, he contends, the Judge granted clearances to applicants with similar\ncircumstances.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  However, each case \u201cmust be\ndecided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Hearing Office decisions, even by the same\nJudge, do not serve as binding precedent.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5,\n2008).  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s analysis of the security concerns raised in this case.  We\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s treatment of the pertinent mitigating conditions is reasonable.\nFurthermore, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis complied with the requirements\nof Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his\ndecision.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03948 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 21, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-09959\nat 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  Therefore, we conclude that the Judge did not conduct a piecemeal\nanalysis, as Applicant contends on appeal.  \nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Edmunds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s 30-year history of illegal drug use, his two drug-related arrests, and\nhis failure to be forthcoming about his drug involvement on two security clearances\napplications make him an unacceptable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a security concern under Guidelines\nH, Drug Involvement, and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nNovember 30, 2009\n\nSee Evidentiary Ruling section of Decision, infra.\n1\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 22, 2009, denying all of the allegations.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 12, 2009. On August 31, 2009, a notice of\nvideo-teleconference was issued scheduling the case for September 23, 2009. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. I received 13 government exhibits, marked and\nidentified as Exhibits 1 through 13, and 18 Applicant exhibits, marked and identified as\nExhibits A through R. Department Counsel objected to Exhibit A, and I reserved\njudgment.  I also received the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. The transcript was\n1\nreceived on September 30, 2009.\nEvidentiary Ruling\nExhibit A sets forth the results of a drug test. The date on the exhibit is two\nweeks after the hearing. Also, the results are in a foreign language. Department\nCounsel objected arguing that Exhibit A lacked a proper foundation. I reserved\njudgment on Exhibit A\u2019s admissibility, and left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request to\nprovide him an opportunity to submit a translated copy and any other supplementary\ndocumentation clarifying when he underwent drug testing (Tr. 24). \nOn September 29, 2009, Applicant provided three additional documents. I\nmarked them as follows: \nExhibit S - Drug Test dated May 26, 2009; \nExhibit T - Drug Test dated September 8, 2009; and, \nExhibit U - Drug Test dated October 6, 2009.\nDepartment Counsel renewed his objections to their admissibility.\nLike Exhibit A, Exhibits S and U are in a foreign language. Exhibit T is in English.\nUpon considering Applicant\u2019s motion for admission of these documents and Department\nCounsel\u2019s objections, I hereby deny Applicant\u2019s motion to admit Exhibits A, S, and U,\nand grant his motion to admit Exhibit T.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old man with two children, ages 19 and 12. Two prior\nmarriages ended in divorce. His first wife is the mother of the older child and his second\nwife is the mother of the younger child. Currently, Applicant lives with his girlfriend and\nher two teenage sons (Exhibit K).\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1977. Two years later he joined the U.S.\nArmy where he served for seven years until his honorable discharge in 1986 (Exhibit 8\nat 11).\n\n3\nSince leaving the military, Applicant has worked in the telecommunications field\n(Exhibit 10 at 1; Tr. 31). Among other things, he develops communication networks for\nthe military in various combat theaters, and maintains battle command video wall\ndisplays (Exhibits Q, L). He has deployed with the military to multiple combat theaters\nduring the past 20 years (Exhibit O). Because of the nature of his work, he has typically\nbeen one of the first group of civilians to deploy with the military to various flashpoints\nand combat theaters. Consequently, his work is hazardous (Exhibit I). \nApplicant has lived abroad since leaving the military. He has been working with\nthe same telecommunications contractor since 2001 (Exhibit I). He has lived in the\nsame foreign country for the past two years (Exhibit C). He has held a security\nclearance continuously since 1979 (Tr. 44).\nApplicant\u2019s second-line supervisor, who oversees 87 people, describes Applicant\nas one of his top performers (Tr. 31). Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who worked with him from\n2003 to 2004 while stationed in Iraq, characterized his work as extraordinary (Exhibit D).\nAccording to another former supervisor, Applicant\u2019s \u201cwork ethic is beyond reproach\u201d\n(Exhibit H). \nApplicant is equally well-respected by his coworkers. According to one coworker,\nhe is extremely meticulous in handling classified material, and on one occasion,\nimplemented a training program to ensure that security standards were upheld (Exhibit\nO). Another coworker characterized him as an on-the-job leader who is always willing to\nshare his expertise with coworkers (Exhibit I).\nApplicant has used marijuana and hashish intermittently for more than 30 years.\nHe began smoking marijuana in 1976 while in high school, and continued to smoke it\nafter entering the Army. In 1982, he experimented with hashish while at a party with\nfriends (Answer). He used hashish two or three more times over a one-month period\nbetween May and June of 1985 (Answer). \nIn July 1985, while stationed abroad, Applicant was arrested by the police of the\ncountry where he was stationed after being caught purchasing hashish (Exhibit 1 at 2).\nWhile being booked, he attempted to flee. The police again detained him, and later\nreleased him to Army\u2019s custody. He was then punished under the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice for resisting arrest and wrongful possession of hashish. He was reduced\nto a lower pay grade, forfeited $300 pay per month for two months, and ordered to\nperform extra duty for 45 days (Exhibit 1 at 6). Later, he was barred from re-enlisting\n(Exhibit 2).\nAs part of a periodic review of Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility in 1987, a\nDefense Investigative Service agent interviewed him (Exhibit 6 ). When the agent asked\nApplicant if he intended to use illegal drugs in the future, he responded, \u201cnot only no, but\nhell no!\u201d (Exhibit 6 at 1).\n\n4\nIn 1992, Applicant shared some hashish with a friend while playing video games\n(Exhibit 10 at 1). He used it on three other occasions that year (Tr. 37). During a\nperiodic reinvestigation of his security clearance eligibility in 2000, a Defense Security\nService agent interviewed him (Exhibit 10). He disclosed the 1992 drug use, but stated\nhe had no intention of using illegal drugs in the future (Id.). \nIn March 2004, Applicant, while cleaning his recently deceased brother\u2019s\napartment, \u201ccame across a drawer with a shoe box of seeds and stems and one rolled\njoint\u201d of marijuana (Tr. 52). He decided to sample some of it (Tr. 52).\nIn September 2004, Applicant, while travelling through Europe to visit his son,\ndecided to stop in a country where hashish was legal, and purchase some (Tr. 50). His\nintention was to use the hashish while in the country where his son lived, and hide the\nremainder at his son\u2019s house, for his next visit, before returning home (Exhibit 13 at 7).\nShortly after leaving the country where hashish is legal, Applicant was stopped by police\nof a bordering country where hashish possession constitutes a misdemeanor criminal\noffense. The police arrested and charged him with possession of hashish (Tr. 51).\nApplicant subsequently paid a fine (Answer).\nIn 1986, Applicant completed a security clearance application (Tr. 45). He failed\nto disclose past hashish use and his 1985 drug-related arrest (Exhibit 5 at 2). He\nomitted this information because he was afraid that he would not get the job for which\nhe had applied (Tr. 45).\nIn 2006, Applicant completed another security clearance application. He failed to\ndisclose his drug-related arrests and his 2004 episodes of illegal drug use, as required\n(Exhibit 11 at 33). He omitted this information because he did not want his new\nemployer to perceive him as \u201cthe new druggie that just came in, just got busted by the\npolice\u201d (Tr. 48-49).\nIn May 2009, Applicant executed a statement of intent never to use illegal drugs\nagain (Exhibit E). In September 2009, Applicant passed a drug test (Exhibit T). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\n\n5\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment, and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant has used marijuana\nand hashish periodically for 30 years. During much of this time, he held a security\nclearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d 24(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia;\u201d and 24(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future\ntriggers the application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca signed statement of\nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d The application of this\nmitigating condition, however, has little probative value given Applicant\u2019s repeated,\nearlier promises to stop using illegal drugs.\nNone of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s most recent\nepisodes of marijuana abuse occurred less than six years ago. Moreover, his\nexplanation that he used it most recently to help him counteract the loss of appetite\nprecipitated by a chronic illness is not credible given the number of years he has been\nabusing marijuana recreationally.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his drug usage and drug-\n\n6\nrelated arrests from his security clearance applications of 1986 and 2006 trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . .\u201d\nApplicant attributes his 1986 omission to a fear of not getting the job if his\npotential employer knew of his drug history. He attributes his 2006 omission to concerns\nof how his employer would perceive him if his drug involvement history was known.\nApplicant has a duty to provide truthful, candid information throughout the security\nclearance process. According to the Appeal Board, \u201c[s]elf-interest is not a valid\njustification for falsifying\u201d (ISCR Case No. 96-0685 (App. Bd. November 14, 1997) at 1))\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse has spanned 30 years, but has been sporadic. He has a\nstellar work history. The sporadic nature of his drug use is outweighed by his repeated\npromises to quit abusing drugs, and his strong work credentials are outweighed by his\nlack of honesty demonstrated through his repeated falsification of security clearance\napplications.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on December 7,\n2005. On August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under alcohol consumption\n(Guideline G). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant\u2019s undated answer was received by DOHA on September 23, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2008, and the hearing was held on\nNovember 19, 2008. At the hearing, two government exhibits (GE 1 and 2) were\nadmitted in evidence without objection to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant\ntestified and submitted seven exhibits (AE A through AE G). DOHA received a copy of\nthe transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings on December 2, 2006. Based upon a review of\nFebruary 12, 2009\n\n2\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges five alcohol-related incidents, which were admitted by\nApplicant. He denied \u00b6 1.f., sketching a general description of his drinking at times to\nexcess from 1996 to 2007 because he did not drink to excess from 1996 to 2006. He\nagrees he drank to excess in 2006 to February 2007 (Tr. 39). After a thorough review of\nthe pleadings and the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant has been employed as a test engineer with a defense contractor since\nMay 2007. Applicant is 31 years old, engaged with no children. He seeks a security\nclearance. \nAfter his graduation from high school in May 1996, Applicant served in the active\nand inactive military until July 2002. Also, he began drinking in 1996 while in the military.\nHis consumption occurred socially at bars on the weekends. During his service, he\nnever drank on duty or before duty. Further, he never drank during the weekdays. His\ndrinking increased in 2000 when he started college while he was still in the military. He\nwas 25 years of age when he received an honorable discharge in July 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s drinking during college (2000 to May 2004) was about four to five\nbeers on weekends, or with friends at football games. After college, he believes he\ndrove a car only three times after consuming alcohol. He never drank alcohol while\nhome alone. His alcohol use made Applicant feel more social. He does not believe his\nalcohol consumption became a physical addiction as set forth in GE 2, but he felt more\nat ease with alcohol consumption. He stated:\nI would become more comfortable. That would develop a linear\nrelationship in my mind. If I had another drink it would be more\ncomfortable, of course. So in that respect, yes. But not a physical\naddiction but a psychological misunderstanding. And that was the most\ncrucial thing we went through in treatment, was becoming aware of that\nand recognizing it. I certainly never craved it (Tr. 46-47).\nOn December 28, 2002 (\u00b6 1.a.), Applicant was arrested and charged with\ndisorderly conduct. Before the arrest, Applicant and a friend from his military unit\ndecided they wanted to play golf on a prestigious course (Tr. 23). Before they were able\nto scale the fence surrounding the course, they were arrested. The court dropped the\ncharges after Applicant successfully met the court condition not to violate the law for\nthree months. \n\n3\nIn the fall of 2002, Applicant moved from his grandparent\u2019s house to a house\nnearer to the campus of the college he was attending. On November 8, 2003, Applicant\nrecalled drinking too much at a downtown celebration by college students after a college\nfootball game. He decided to walk home before the celebration ended, and was charged\nwith public intoxication. Applicant pled guilty to public intoxication and was fined\n$200.00.\nThirteen days before Applicant\u2019s 28  birthday, he was drinking (Tr. 26) in a car\nth\nand was charged with the open container infraction (\u00b6 1.c.) on May 7, 2005. He pled\nguilty and was fined $147.00. \nOn October 21, 2006, Applicant had consumed about six or seven beers at an\noffice function. At about 1 A.M. in the morning, he was stopped for speeding while\ndriving home. During the course of the stop, an operating while under the influence of\nalcohol (OWI, \u00b6 1.d.) charge was imposed by the arresting officers when Applicant failed\na breathalyzer test to determine the level of alcohol in Applicant\u2019s blood. He pled guilty\nto the OWI charge. The record is silent on the eventual status of the speeding charge.\nHe received 10 hours of community service and required to attend a 12-hour alcohol\neducation course. His court fines totaled about $1,300.00, and he received six months\nof unsupervised probation. \nWhile on probation and before he completed the education course for \u00b6 1.d,\nApplicant committed public alcohol consumption/intoxication on February 10, 2007 (\u00b6\n1.e.). Before he was arrested, he was drinking at the same bar as in October 2006. See,\n\u00b6 1.d. He arrived at the bar about 6 P.M. or 7 P.M., and when he left the bar to walk\nhome, he believes he was intoxicated after drinking six or seven beers and five shots of\nliquor (GE 2). Believing his judgment was affected, Applicant decided to walk home. On\nhis way home, he was charged with public intoxication. He paid a court fine of $135.80. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s probation for \u00b6 1.e., the judge conducted a probation\nhearing, and agreed to continue his unsupervised probation on condition he complete a\nsix-week outpatient treatment program. The meetings occurred once a week, each\nsession lasting a half day. Applicant received his certificate of completion in May 2007. \nApplicant has been entirely forthright about his alcohol-related incidents to family,\nfriends, and his employers (GE 2). He indicates his last alcoholic drink was in February\n2007. His decision to abstain was partially due to the possibility of losing his fianc\u00e9 if he\ndid not stop his alcohol abuse. See also, AE B.\nCharacter Evidence\nAE A contains Applicant\u2019s academic transcript from a technical college. The\ntranscript reflects that Applicant received excellent grades in the fall of 2000. The\nsecond transcript in AE A contains Applicant\u2019s good grades from the school he\ngraduated from in May 2004,  achieving a graduating grade point average of 3.27 out of\na 4-point grading system.\n\n Applicant indicated in AE F that the house was purchased in March 2008. \n1\n4\nThe treatment discharge profile (AE B) dated April 23, 2007, showed that the\ntreatment counselor assessed the level of Applicant\u2019s risk for an alcohol relapse to be at\na low level, and noted the lack of a strong support system in the local area would\npresent continuing challenges to his recovery. The bases for her conclusion appear to\nbe limited to her clinical observations of and discussions with Applicant during the group\ncounseling course of treatment. Whether she employed other tools to underscore or\nsupport her assessment is not known. \nAE C are performance reviews for 2005 and 2006. The review for 2005 includes\na notation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor indicating that Applicant should be promoted\nbecause of his performance. The 2006 review reflects that Applicant met expectations\nof his job requirements. \nAE D indicates Applicant received an award while in the military for his service as\na radio repairer from July 1997 to June 2000. \nApplicant\u2019s coworker/roommate from 2004 until he moved back to the local area\nin May 2007 indicated in one of the character statements in (AE E) that Applicant was\nalways on time with his portion of the rent, and to his roommate\u2019s knowledge, never\nmissed a work-related deadline. \nApplicant\u2019s friend, who was his roommate in college, and has remained his friend\nfor the past eight years, was aware Applicant drank on occasion. However, his friend\nremembered Applicant more for spending many weekend evenings studying rather than\nmigrating downtown, and presumably consuming alcohol. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is a Ph.D. candidate in the field of plant pathology. As she\nexplains in her statement (AE E), she met Applicant about six years ago and is now\nengaged to marry him. Because her aunt and uncle experienced alcohol problems, she\nmade it clear in early 2007 that Applicant would have to refrain from his alcohol abuse\nor risk losing her. She believes Applicant took the alcohol counseling seriously as\ndemonstrated by lifestyle changes he made. In May 2007, he returned to the local area\nwhere his parents and his fianc\u00e9 live. In January 2008, his fianc\u00e9 purchased a house\nwith Applicant in the area where the family lives.  As confirmed by the manager who\n1\ntestified at the hearing, the two frequently work in the garden or make home\nimprovements together (Tr. 58). They participate in area activities where alcohol is not a\nnecessary component. \nAE F is a position statement (49 pages in length) by Applicant addressing various\nevents and people in his life, and how those events and people relate to the SOR\nallegations. In addition, his position statement includes his explanation of how the\ntreatment in March 2007 was beneficial to him, and how his return to the local area\nenhances his independent network of support.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s manager at his current employer, who is also the security manager\nfor the company, testified that he was promoted to that position when Applicant began\nhis employment in May 2007. Though the manager did not take part in Applicant\u2019s\nhiring, he did take part in Applicant\u2019s most recent performance rating. Applicant did not\nbring his evaluation to the hearing, but the manager recalled that Applicant received the\nhighest performance appraisal and highest pay raise for employees in his laboratory (Tr.\n55). The manager views Applicant as a self-starting employee who is reliable. Finally,\nthe manager testified that based his observations of Applicant refusing to consume\nalcohol in social situations, Applicant\u2019s honesty with coworkers about not consuming\nalcohol, and the support Applicant is receiving from his fianc\u00e9 to facilitate abstinence or\ncontrol, e.g., gardening and other household improvement activities, there is nothing in\nApplicant\u2019s behavior to indicate he is addicted to alcohol (Tr. 57-58). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\n\n6\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\n21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nFive alcohol-related incidents between December 2002 and February 2007 raise\nunequivocal security concerns under Alcohol Consumption (AC) disqualifying condition\n(DC) 22.a. (alcohol-related incidents away from work regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent). The two alcohol-\nrelated incidents in December 2002 and November 2003 would ordinarily be extenuated\nif Applicant had not continued alcohol-related behavior after college, culminating in his\nOWI conviction in October 2006, and his potential probation violation in February 2007\nof public intoxication. However, drinking to binge levels preceding the OWI and public\nintoxication offenses demonstrates continuing poor judgment that can only be mitigated\nby constructive behavioral changes that include a network of support that enhances\nabstinence or control over alcohol. \nApplicant testified repeatedly that he never drank during the week, and\nconsumed only four or five beers on the weekend. Applicant\u2019s drinking pattern should\nbe viewed as binge-type drinking rather than habitual because of the concentrated\nscope of his drinking. Before the OWI in October 2006, he engaged in binge drinking. In\nFebruary 2007, while on probation for the October 2006 OWI, he consumed the same\nnumber of beers, but also several shots of whiskey before his public intoxication arrest.\nApplicant\u2019s drinking in 2006 and 2007 falls within the scope of AC DC 22.c. (habitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent). \nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) under the alcohol guideline that may\npotentially apply in whole, in part, or not at all to Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation. With\nApplicant\u2019s last consumption of alcohol occurring about 17 months ago, AC MC 23.a.\n(so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) has only limited\napplication to the circumstances of this case. Applicant\u2019s good judgment that emanates\nfrom his overall job performance and lifestyle changes are insufficient to overcome the\npassage of only 17 months since his last alcohol use. \n\n7\nNotwithstanding the recency of Applicant\u2019s last use of alcohol, Applicant has\nconvinced me he comprehends his alcohol issues and intends to maintain his pattern of\nabstinence or responsible use. Applicant is accorded substantial consideration under\nAC MC 23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence or responsible use). Applicant, who has been dating\nhis fianc\u00e9 for six years, decided to heed her stern warning that she was going to leave\nhim unless he stopped his alcohol abuse. In May 2007, he returned to the local area to\nwork where his parents and his girlfriend live. In January 2008, he purchased a house\nwith his fianc\u00e9, and plans to marry her in May 2009. Applicant\u2019s manager, who testified\nthat Applicant received the highest pay raise and promotion of any employee in the unit,\nhas observed no indication of alcohol use or abuse by Applicant since he began his\nemployment in May 2007. In sum, while the mitigating evidence falls short under AC MC\n23.a. due to the passage of only 17 months, Applicant\u2019s recognition of his alcohol issues\nand acknowledged action to reverse the sizeable risk for alcohol abuse, enables\nApplicant to overcome the negative evidence under the alcohol guideline.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating factors in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s five alcohol-related offenses\nbetween December 2002 and February 2007 creates unavoidable concern about\nApplicant because he continued to consume alcohol in binge amounts that resulted in\nalcohol-related incidents. When Applicant was stopped in May 2005, there was an open\ncontainer of alcohol in the car. Before his arrests in 2006 and 2007, Applicant had been\ndrinking at ths same bar with friends for more than a few hours. Fortunately, Applicant\nexercised good judgment in February 2007 by walking instead of trying to drive home as\nhe had in October 2006. \nHaving carefully weighed and balanced Applicant\u2019s successful treatment with the\nsubsequent events in his life beginning in May 2007, I conclude the treatment had a\nprofound effect on his lifestyle. The first thing he learned was that he needed a support\nmechanism unavailable at his duty location in the Midwestern part of the country. He\n\n8\nalso received a clear-cut message from his fianc\u00e9 to make behavioral changes in his\nlifestyle to save their future together. He returned to the area where his family and\nfianc\u00e9 live, and where he grew up. With the guidance and support his family, his fianc\u00e9,\nand his manager, Applicant has made positive changes in his lifestyle that appear in AE\nF, and have been mentioned. Applicant\u2019s current network of support that now extends to\nall parts of his lifestyle now that he and his wife are living together, convinces me that\nthe chances of a recurrence of alcohol abuse in Applicant\u2019s future are wanting.\nApplicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the AC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",
