The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines H and E on April 7, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nOctober 21, 2009\n\nGE 1.\n1\nId.; Tr. 29-31.\n2\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 16, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on April 30, 2009. DOHA received the request on May 4, 2009. Although\nhe did not request a hearing before an administrative judge, Department Counsel did.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 9, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on June 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 29, 2009, and\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on July 23, 2009. The government offered six\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted 12 exhibits (AE) A through\nL, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed\non July 23, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 31, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on July 9, 2009. At the hearing, I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 10-11.) \nAmendment to the SOR\nIn SOR allegation 2.e, the government alleges that Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nquestion c in Section 24 of his security clearance application completed on January 23,\n2007, then alleges that he falsified this answer when he did not disclose his varying\nmarijuana use through 2004. The SOR is amended to reflect that Applicant answered\n\u201cno\u201d to this question.   \n1\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to\n2.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied he intentionally falsified his answers. He\nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  \nApplicant, who is 49 years old, works as a network electronics technician for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has worked as an electronics technician for 10\nyears, and has held a clearance without incident since 1996.2\nApplicant married his first wife in 1980 at age 19. They separated in 1993 and\ndivorced in 1996. He has two sons, ages 27 and 20, from this marriage.

They did not have any children. He\nmarried his present wife in 2007. He has one grandchild.3\nApplicant graduated from high school and attended a community college for two\nyears. As a high school student in 1977 and 1978, he tried marijuana on two different\noccasions. He also used marijuana in 1978 and 1979 while a college student. After a\nnight of heavy drinking in college, he thinks he may have used cocaine twice on one\noccasion. His recall on this issue is vague.4\nApplicant began regular use of marijuana after he married in 1980 and\nthroughout his 13-year marriage. When the opportunity presented, he smoked\nmarijuana at family gatherings with his first wife\u2019s family. He did not smoke marijuana in\nhis home, but remembers smoking marijuana on two occasions in his driveway with his\nbrother-in-law. He could not estimate the number of times he smoked marijuana with his\nfirst wife\u2019s family. He indicated it was hit or miss, not everyday or once every week. He\nnever purchased the marijuana he smoked during this period. When his marriage\nended, he stopped his marijuana use.5\nIn 1996, Applicant befriended a man undergoing treatment for cancer. By 1998,\nhis friend had become very ill and was confined to bed. His friend asked Applicant to\nobtain marijuana, which Applicant did on one occasion. As an expression of gratitude,\nhis friend offered him a one-hitter pipe, meaning a one puff size pipe, which Applicant\naccepted. He smoked marijuana, thereafter, on rare occasions between 1998 and 2004.\nApplicant acknowledged that he should not have taken the pipe or purchased the\nmarijuana, and that he knew smoking marijuana was illegal. He acknowledged that he\nsmoked marijuana while holding a security clearance. Applicant last used marijuana in\nearly 2004, more than five and one-half years ago.6\nIn early 2004, Applicant sought a security clearance through another federal\ngovernment agency. Because he discussed his drug use with the polygraph examiner\nprior to his test, the polygraph examiner did not ask him questions about drugs. Rather,\nthe polygraph examiner asked him questions about \u201chacking\u201d into government\ncomputers, which he vehemently denied. Subsequently, this agency denied him a\nsecurity clearance.7\nApplicant completed his first SF-86 on August 18, 1997. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nthe following question about his drug use:\n\nGE 4; Tr. 60-63.\n8\nGE 6.\n9\nGE 2.\n10\nGE 1.\n11\n4\nQuestion 27: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity-Illegal Use of Drugs \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you\nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine,\ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),\namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers,\netc), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? (emphasis\nsupplied)\nHe indicated that he used marijuana one to two times a month between January 1989\nand May 1994. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the other drug related questions.8\nOn October 23, 1997, Applicant met with an investigator and signed a written\nstatement. In his statement, Applicant admitted using marijuana one time in high school\nand smoking it one to two times a month between 1989 and 1994 with his brother-in-\nlaw. He denied purchasing or manufacturing marijuana during this time. He also\nexpressed an intent to never use illegal drugs in the future.9\nApplicant completed an electronic form of the SF-86 on April 3, 2006. Concerning\nhis drug use, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 24B, acknowledging he illegally used drugs\nas a public safety official. The document fails to provide his explanation for his positive\nanswer. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the other two drug questions. He also acknowledged that\nhe was denied a security clearance by another federal agency. He explained that he\nhad a close family friend who died of cancer. His friend smoked marijuana to control his\nnausea and pain, and Applicant smoked a small amount with his friend while holding a\nsecurity clearance. He also explained that he forgot to list his use on his SF-86 for the\nother federal agency, but told the polygraph examiner upon his arrival for his polygraph\ntest.10\nOn January 23, 2007, Applicant completed his e-QIP. He again answered \u201cyes\u201d\nto Question 24b and admitted using illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance.\nHe explained his answer, stating he used marijuana with his sick friend once in 1998.\nHe answered \u201cno\u201d to the other two drug questions, which ask about his drug use  and\nillegal purchase and manufacture for the last seven years. He acknowledged that\nanother federal agency had denied him a security clearance, indicating his clearance\nhad been denied because of his drug use while holding a security clearance.   \n11\nApplicant met with an investigator on January 2, 2008 in a public restaurant. He\nreviewed his marijuana use with the investigator. He admitted smoking marijuana twice\n\nGE 5.\n12\nTr. 52-55, 64-75.\n13\nAE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H; AE I; AE J.\n14\n5\nin 1997 or 1978 with friends either to experiment or in response to peer pressure. He\ndid not purchase this marijuana. He also admitted smoking marijuana with his sick\nfriend and purchasing marijuana on one occasion for his friend. He denied any other\nuse of marijuana or other illegal drugs. He denied intentionally falsifying his e-QIP,\nstating that he forgot about his marijuana use.12\nApplicant characterizes his failure to acknowledge his drug use on his SF-86 and\ne-QIP and during his interview as forgetfulness, panic, fear, and scared. He denied a\ndeliberate intent to falsify his answers.13\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors and co-workers described him as an excellent, dedicated,\nreliable, and dependable worker. He performed all the duties required by his job very\nwell. He is an invaluable asset to his company. One co-worker discussed Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to satisfactorily address questions about events in Applicant\u2019s past and the issue\nof  Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. He believed Applicant answered incorrectly out of fear,\nanxiety and an extreme source of personal embarrassment. He stated that Applicant\u2019s\nconduct does not reflect Applicant\u2019s true character. Applicant received good\nperformance reviews.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n6\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nApplicant first smoked marijuana as a high school student. He started regularly\nsmoking marijuana following his marriage to his first wife. When they separated, he\nstopped his marijuana use. When a friend became seriously ill with cancer in 1998, he\npurchased marijuana on one occasion for his friend. When his grateful friend offered\nhim marijuana, he accepted the gift. He then smoked marijuana occasionally for the\nnext six years while holding a security clearance. The government established its case\nunder the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g).\nUnder AG \u00b626(a), Applicant can mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nabout his drug use if he shows that his use was not recent, infrequent, not likely to\nrecur, and does not cast doubt on his \u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d. He can also mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns by showing a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as disassociation from\ndrug-using associates, changing his environment, an appropriate period of abstinence,\nand, a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation. See AG \u00b6 AG 26(b)(1)-(4). Applicant stopped using marijuana over five and\none-half years ago, which is a sufficient time of abstinence to support mitigation.\nHowever, Applicant first stopped using marijuana in 1993, then resumed his marijuana\nuse five years later. In addition, in his 1997 interview, Applicant stated an intent not to\nuse drugs in the future. Eighteen months later, he started smoking marijuana after he\nhad been granted a security clearance. While he no longer associates with individuals\nwho actively use drugs, sufficient time has not elapsed to demonstrate that he can\nremain away from marijuana use. By using marijuana while holding a security\nclearance, he breeched a trust given to him by the government. He has not provided\nsufficient information to show that he would not breech this trust in the future. He has\nnot mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline H.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n8\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information: and\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group.\nApplicant failed to provide clear and accurate information about his past\nmarijuana use. In 1997, he placed the government on notice of significant marijuana\nuse when he completed his security clearance application. He did not, however, fully\ndisclosure of his marijuana use during his meeting with the security investigator in 1997.\nWhen he completed his most recent security clearance application, Applicant had a duty\nto disclose that he had resumed smoking marijuana on a sporadic basis between 1998\nand 2004. He did not. Instead, he minimized his marijuana use on this application and in\nan interview with the security investigator. His failure to be forthright about his marijuana\nuse, particularly since 1998, was intentional. \n\n9\nApplicant has little memory of using cocaine on one occasion in college in 1978\nor 1979. His failure to disclose his one-time use of cocaine is not intentional. When he\nmet with the security investigator in 1997, it had been more than 18 years since he may\nhave used cocaine after a night of drinking. When he met with the investigator in 2008,\nhis possible use of cocaine had been nearly 30 years earlier. The failure to recall\nconduct while drunk and after a considerable length of time is not unreasonable. With\nthe exception of SOR allegations 2.d.(2) and 2.g, the government has established its\ncase under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(c), 16(d)(1) and (3), 16(e) and Guideline E.  \nApplicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 17 if he\ncan establish:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant states that he no longer smokes marijuana and that he no longer\nassociates with people who use marijuana. In 1997, Applicant stated that he did not\nintend to use marijuana in the future, yet within 18 months, he started smoking\n\n10\nmarijuana again. His reasoning for not being truthful on his security clearance\napplication and with the investigator supports a denial of his clearance rather than\nprovides a rationale for mitigating the government\u2019s case. He has not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The\nevidence in support of denying a security clearance to Applicant under the whole person\nconcept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a grant. Applicant used\nmarijuana on a regular basis for at least 15 years. In 1997, he expressed an intent not\nto use marijuana. After a nearly five-year abstinence and within 18 months of his stated\nintent not to use marijuana again, he resumed smoking marijuana on a sporadic basis\nfor another six years. While he stopped his marijuana consumption over five years ago\nand no longer associates with his former in-laws, he needs more time to demonstrate\nthat he will not use marijuana in the future. More importantly, Applicant has not been\nforthright about his past marijuana use when recently providing information. He is\nembarrassed and ashamed of his past conduct, which could make him vulnerable to\ncoercion, pressure, and exploitation. His failure to provide clear and accurate\ninformation about his past drug use reflects poorly on his judgment and trustworthiness.\n\n11\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d(1)\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d(2)\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is\ndenied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 12, 2006.\nOn August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 27, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on October 18,\n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 14, 2007, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on November 26, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1\nthrough 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Exhibits A through P, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n2\nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 5, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to India. (Tr. at 10-12.) The request and the attached documents\nwere admitted into evidence as Exhibit 5. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 27, 2007, Applicant admitted all of the\nfactual allegations in the SOR. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 64 years old and was born in India in 1943. He moved to the United\nStates in 1969 to pursue a higher education, and he remained because of the excellent\nopportunities he saw here. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1986.\nApplicant received a Masters of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from a United\nStates university in 1971.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. He previously was\nemployed by another defense contractor from 1974 through 2004, when he retired. He\nretained a security clearance during the period that he worked for this employer. During\nhis career of 35 years working in the aerospace industry, Applicant has published 63\npapers and obtained 16 United States patents. \nFor the last 35 years, Applicant has been married to an Indian born, United\nStates citizen, and they have three children, who were all born in the United States, and\nare U.S. citizens. His two sons are medical doctors and his daughter is attending a U.S.\nuniversity. Applicant and his wife also have one grandson, who is a United States\nresident and citizen. Applicant also has one sister who is a U.S. citizen and resides\nhere. \nApplicant has a number of relatives that reside in India and are Indian citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law was a member of the Parliament of India for two and one half\nyears, but he is approximately 86 years old, and he has been retired for many years. He\nnow does social and charitable work, often using his own assets, as he is quite wealthy.\nApplicant has very little contact with him.\n\n3\nApplicant has three brothers, two who lived in India their entire lives and are\nIndian citizens, and one who lived in the United States for 35 years and is a U.S. citizen,\nbut has moved back to India. \nHis oldest brother was the CEO of the State Bank of India. He is 87 year old and\nhas been retired for 28 years. His second brother is 77 years old, and long retired.\nApplicant communicates with both of them approximately every three or four months.\nHis third brother moved back to India after he retired, because his limited financial\nresources would go further in India than in the United States. \nFinally Applicant\u2019s wife has nine siblings. All four sisters and one brother are\ncitizens and residents of the United States. The other four brothers are citizens and\nresidents of India, but none of them are employed by the Indian Government.\nApplicant\u2019s contact with them is extremely limited.\nApplicant maintains a bank account in India with an approximate value of $2,000.\nHe also has purchased a condominium in India, which is in the process of being built,\nworth approximately $164,000. He has traveled to India during the years 2000, 2001,\n2005, 2006, and he testified that he planned to go again to India shortly after the\nhearing date. \nApplicant testified that he had two primary reasons for visiting India as often as\nhe has. First, he visited his elderly and ailing mother, who passed away in 2006. The\nsecond reason for his trips to India, was to receive a unique and beneficial treatment for\nhis debilitating arthritis, which was only available in India or China. This treatment\nrequired multiple trips for treatment. He testified that he purchased the condominium so\nthat he could stay there after his treatments, and he kept the bank account in India to\nmake the payments on the condominium. \nApplicant testified that he has been successful financially in the United States,\nand he offered documents into evidence to show that he had a net worth of\napproximately $4.6 million (Exhibits G, H). He also offered into evidence letters from\nindividuals who know or have known him: in his professional life (Exhibits A-E), those\nthat know him in his personal life (Exhibits I-K), and from his son (Exhibit F).  They\nspoke in extremely laudatory terms of his high integrity, honor and devotion to the\nUnited States. Additionally, Applicant testified that he has been made a fellow of the\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, an extremely prestigious organization.\nFinally, he testified about some of the activities in the community which he has been\ninvolved, including the organizing of health fairs for which he has received Certificates\nof Congressional Recognition (Exhibits L, M). \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding India. According to its\nconstitution, India is a \u201csovereign, socialist secular democratic republic.\u201d It is a\nmultiparty, federal parliamentary democracy and has a population of approximately 1.1\nbillion people. The United States recognizes India as a key to interests of the U.S., and\nit has sought to strengthen its relationship with India. However differences do remain\n\n4\nbetween the two countries, including the concern of the U.S. over India\u2019s nuclear\nweapons program, its abuses of human rights, and its continued, increasing cooperation\nwith Iran.  Finally, India has been identified as one of the most active collectors of\nsensitive U.S. economic and proprietary information. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion; and (e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a\nforeign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could\nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives, including his sister, brothers, father-in-law and brothers-in-law, who are\ncitizens and residents of India, make DC (a) and (b) a concern to the Government. The\nbank account and the ownership of the condominium, both in India, apply to DC (e).  \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\n\n6\ninterests of the U.S.; (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest. \nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant, who is 64 years old, has lived in the United States for 38\nyears and been a U.S. citizen for 21 years. He is married to a U.S. citizen and his three\nchildren and one grandchild are all U.S. citizens and residents.  He has worked in the\naerospace industry for 35 years and held a security clearance for most of that time with\nno known infractions. He has been successful in this country and been able to\naccumulate net wealth of $4.6 million. He has received many positive and laudatory\nletters of recommendation from individuals that have known him in different capacities\nover many years. While he has traveled to India a number of times to visit his ill mother,\nwho is now deceased, and to receive medical care unique to India, his attachment to\nthe United States is overwhelmingly greater than that to India. The value of the property\nthat he owns in India is insignificant compared to his U.S. holdings.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

For several years,\nApplicant then was a member of the faculty at an institute.  Applicant still has some contact with his\ncolleagues there.

He also has a bank account in India in the amount of $6,000, in case his\nmother would need his assistance.\nIndia has trading and investment ties with the U.S. and has a generally positive record on\nhuman rights.  However, India is known as one of the most active collectors of sensitive U.S.\neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information and is a strong ally of Iran.  The U.S. has\nsanctioned Indian scientists and companies for transferring sensitive weapons-related\nequipment/technology to Iran.  Furthermore, there have been numerous cases of the illegal export\nor attempted export of restricted, dual-use technology to India.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.8(a).\n1\n3\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nApplicant does not appeal the Judge\u2019s factual findings.  Rather, Applicant claims error\nregarding the Judge\u2019s conclusions, especially the relationship between MC 8(b) and the Judge\u2019s\nultimate conclusions. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nAfter the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.    The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had not met that burden in this case. \nSpecifically in regard to MC 8(a) and (c), the Judge found that Applicant had not presented\nevidence sufficient to mitigate the presence of his relatives, in-laws, and colleagues in India.  That\nis, the Judge found that Applicant had not established that \u201cit is unlikely [Applicant] will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of [his Indian family] and the interests of the\nU. S.\u201d   Decision at 8.  In this regard, the Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s close relationships with family\n1\nmembers in India and his continuing contacts with former colleagues in India, as well as India\u2019s\ncollection of sensitive information and materials.\nHowever, with regard to MC 8(b), the Judge pointed out Applicant\u2019s significant ties to the\nUnited States and concluded that \u201c[Applicant] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the United States\u2019 interests.\u201d  Decision at 9.     \nWhen the Judge then performed a whole-person analysis, he discussed evidence both\nfavorable and unfavorable to Applicant.  Among the favorable factors, the Judge mentioned\nApplicant\u2019s loyalty, the positive testimony of his supervisor and neighbor, and the fact that his\nchildren are American citizens and are thoroughly immersed in American culture and lifestyle.  The\nJudge stated that \u201c[t]here is no reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause\npotential harm to his sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States.\u201d  Decision at 10.  Among the\n\n4\nnegative factors, the Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s personal and financial ties to India and India\u2019s\nrecord on information-gathering.  The Judge then concluded that Applicant had not mitigated the\nrelevant security concerns and the Judge was left \u201cwith doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility\nand suitability.\u201d  Decision at 11.\nThe Board has repeatedly found that the application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them\napply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23,\n2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nHowever, in this case, Applicant is correct in finding portions of the Judge\u2019s decision\nperplexing and contradictory.  In discussing MC 8(b), the Judge made the unqualified statement that\n\u201c[Applicant] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States\u2019\ninterests.\u201d  Decision at 9.  That conclusion is echoed in the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis, in which\nhe said that \u201c[t]here is no reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential\nharm to his sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States.\u201d  Id. at 10.  Elsewhere in his decision, the\nJudge reached conclusions which appear to be at odds with to those quoted above, and the Judge\nstated at the end of his decision that he had  \u201cdoubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and\nsuitability.\u201d  Id. at 11.  The Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion was a clearance denial.  While there is record\nevidence to support the negative conclusions and the ultimate denial, the Judge\u2019s statements above\nappear to contradict his ultimate conclusion.  The case is therefore remanded to the Judge for\nclarification. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is REMANDED.      \nSigned: Jean E. Smallin      \nJean E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRichard Murray, Esq.\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 18, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\n2\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn July 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn October 9, 2008, the Board remanded the case to the Judge for a new decision.  On November\n20, 2008, the Judge issued his remand decision, again denying Applicant a security clearance.\nApplicant submitted a timely appeal pursuant to the Directive. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant contends that\nthe Judge committed error in not clarifying contradictory language found in his initial decision and\nthat the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant may be vulnerable to foreign influence is arbitrary and\ncapricious.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is a scientist at a U.S.\nuniversity.  He was born in India and educated there through the Ph.D. level.  For several years,\nApplicant then was a member of the faculty at an institute.  Applicant still has some contact with his\ncolleagues there.  Applicant came to the U.S. in the early 1980s for post-doctoral studies and\nremained here, except for trips to India.  Applicant met and married his spouse when they were\nstudents in India.  Both became U.S. citizens in the mid-1990s.    \nApplicant and his wife have relatives in India.  Applicant maintains close contact with his\nmother, speaking to her at least twice per month.  He speaks to his sisters once or twice a month.\nApplicant\u2019s wife speaks to her parents once a week and to her brothers three times a year.\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a faculty member at an Indian research institute.\nApplicant bought real property in India in the early 2000s, which is worth about $80,000.\nApplicant\u2019s father willed him property including the family home, which Applicant\u2019s mother\noccupies.  The record does not indicate the value of the property, and Applicant has not decided\nwhether to accept any of it.  He also has a bank account in India in the amount of $6,000, in case his\nmother should need his assistance.\nIndia has trading and investment ties with the U.S. and has a generally positive record on\nhuman rights.  However, India is known as one of the most active collectors of sensitive U.S.\neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information and is a strong ally of Iran.  The U.S. has\nsanctioned Indian scientists and companies for transferring sensitive weapons-related\nequipment/technology to Iran.  Furthermore, there have been numerous cases of the illegal export\nor attempted export of restricted, dual-use technology to India.\nAfter the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge\ndiscussed the possible application of the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nconcluded that Applicant had not met that burden in this case.  Applicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions in that regard.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\n\n3\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., 06-06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 12, 2007).\n    \nAs discussed in the previous paragraph, the Judge looked at both the favorable and\nunfavorable record evidence and reasonably explained why Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation did\nnot overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  In his whole-person analysis, the Judge also\nprovided clarification of some statements he made regarding mitigation in his earlier decision.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient\nto demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  \nIn his appeal, Applicant cited decisions by other Hearing Office Judges which he believes\nsupport his argument that the Judge in this case erred in denying him a security clearance.  The\nBoard gives due consideration to those decisions.  However, they are not binding legal precedent for\nother Judges in other cases, and they are not binding on the Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n27081 at 7 (App. Bd. Nov. 10, 2004).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The case was assigned to me on January 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 5, 2008. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on February 29, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, \nwhich were admitted without objection (Tr. 20).2 Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nand presented the testimony of two witnesses and seven exhibits, marked AE A through \nG, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on March 10, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior professional staff (scientist) working at a U.S. \nuniversity. He was born, raised, and educated in India. He received his bachelor\u2019s, \nmaster\u2019s, and PhD degrees in India. His parents paid for his education up to his \nmaster\u2019s degree. He received a full scholarship from the Indian government to attend \nhis PhD studies at a prestigious Indian institute (Tr. 25-26). After completing his PhD, \nApplicant became a member of the faculty (lecturer) at the Indian institute, and worked \nthere for five years (Tr. 25, 75-83). He still maintains contact with some of his friends \nfrom college and with colleagues from his days at the Indian research institute. He has \ntelephone contact with his colleagues once a year, exchanges e-mails sporadically with \nthem, and he visits them when he is in India (Tr. 95). \n \nIn 1983, Applicant took a sabbatical from the Indian institute to attend post-\ndoctoral studies at a U.S. university. At the end of his studies, he was offered a two-year \nposition and then, a permanent job at the university. He traveled back to India to consult \nwith his family about his job opportunity. He took the U.S. job and worked at the \nuniversity for a period of time. After working for a second U.S. employer, in 1989, \nApplicant was hired by his current employer (Tr. 30, 75). \n \nIn 1979, Applicant married his Indian-born spouse in India (GE 1). She was a \nstudent at the same university he attended. They have two sons born of this marriage, \nages 27, and 18 (Tr. 25-26). In 1996, Applicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. They decided to become U.S. citizens because their sons were growing up and \nwere being educated as Americans. Their older son came to the United States when he \nwas two years old, and their younger son was born in the United States. Applicant \nbelieves his sons would never leave the United States to go back to live in India (Tr. \n \n2  GEs 6 & 7 were marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n32). Applicant and his wife enjoy living and working in the United States. She has \nworked for a large U.S. bank for the last 20 years. She holds a vice-president position at \nthe bank (Tr. 32). \n \nApplicant\u2019s two sons are exceptional students. The eldest attended some of the \nfinest graduate and post-graduate institutions the United States can offer, and is \ncurrently attending post-doctoral studies. The youngest is following in his brother\u2019s \nfootsteps (Tr. 60-61). Applicant\u2019s evidence credibly shows his sons were raised as \nAmericans and are well integrated into the American culture. They were encouraged to \nparticipate in school activities, to run for student counsel positions, and to volunteer in \ncommunity activities. Applicant and his wife set the example for their sons with their \ninvolvement in community activities and their volunteer work (AE D, E, F). \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s immediate and extended family members are \nresidents and citizens of India. He has close ties of affection and/or obligation with his \nmother and two sisters. He has telephonic contact with his mother at least twice a \nmonth. They talk about family issues and her health. They never discuss his business or \nwork related matters. Applicant\u2019s sisters (A and B) are both married, each has two \nchildren and they are homemakers. Sister A\u2019s husband was the general manager for a \nnationalized bank in India. He retired in 2008, and now works in the private sector (Tr. \n40, 78). Sister B\u2019s husband worked as a scientist for an Indian government sponsored \nresearch laboratory. He specialized in the same scientific field as Applicant. Applicant \nbelieves he is now retired and works as an emeritus professor for a government institute \n(Tr. 41, 79, 107). Applicant has telephonic contact with his sisters once or twice a \nmonth; they exchange e-mails sporadically, and he visits with them whenever he is in \nIndia (Tr. 43, 94). \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 78 years old, and owns a small pharmacy in India. His \nwife is a 68-year-old homemaker. His wife talks to her parents once a week. Applicant \npartakes in the telephone conversations whenever his wife talks to her parents and he \nis around (Tr. 43). Applicant\u2019s wife has two brothers and two sisters. One of her two \nbrothers is a doctor at a private hospital. Her other brother is an accountant who used to \nwork for a quasi-government agency. He now works as a private consultant (Tr. 44). \nApplicant\u2019s wife claimed she has contact with her brothers approximately three times a \nyear. One of her sister\u2019s husband owns a store. Her sister is a homemaker. The second \nsister and her husband are both deaf and mute (Tr. 116). \n \nIn 1998, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law (a scientist and faculty member of an Indian \nresearch institute) and the Director of the Indian research institute invited Applicant to \nbe the guest speaker at a scientific symposium. The Indian research institute is under \nthe auspices of the Indian government. Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor authorized him \nto attend the symposium. He was required to speak only about information that had \nbeen published (Tr. 45, 76). There is no evidence Applicant has compromised or \ncaused the compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAround 2001-2002, Applicant opened a bank account in India. The purpose of \nthe bank account was to facilitate providing financial support to his parents. He provided \nfinancial support to his parents since 1985 (Tr. 97). In 2006, he was providing around \n$150-$200 a month. When his father died, he decided to stop providing support for his \nmother because she no longer needed it. He kept money in an Indian bank account in \nthe event his mother had an emergency situation. As of the hearing day, the account \nhad a value of approximately $6,000. He also opened the bank account to facilitate his \npurchase of real estate property in India (Tr. 48-49, 83).  \n \nIn 2003, Applicant bought a condominium for his mother\u2019s intermittent use (Tr. \n50). He claimed when his mother no longer needs it, he will dispose of the condo. He \nestimated the value of the condo to be around $80,000 (Tr. 80). Applicant\u2019s father died \nin 2006, and in his will, he left Applicant the family home. His mother lives in the home. \nApplicant has not accepted the inheritance, and is debating whether to do so. He did not \nprovide an estimated value for the property he inherited from his father. \n \nSince his arrival to the United States in 1983, Applicant has travelled frequently \nback to India to visit his family and to participate in family events. He travelled to India in \n1986, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2007. He also plans to visit his mother \nand attend a niece\u2019s wedding during the later part of 2008 (Tr. 56, 89-94). \n \nApplicant never discusses his work with any of his relatives, including his mother, \nsiblings, and in-laws (Tr. 66). He also averred he never discusses classified information \nwith his brother-in-law (scientist) or any of his friends and colleagues from his days \nworking for Indian research institutions. Applicant is a loyal American. He promised to \nreport to his employer and the FBI any inquiries about his work and/or any possible \nthreat against the United States from any foreigners, U.S. citizens, or from his family \nmembers (Tr. 66).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of his supervisor/manager and \na long-time neighbor. The supervisor has known, worked with, and supervised Applicant \nduring the last 10 years on a daily basis. She considers Applicant to be a hard-working, \nethical, and dedicated employee. He is perceived as being truthful, honest, and \nconscientious about enforcement of security rules. According to his supervisor, \nApplicant has always followed the rules and procedures to protect classified information. \nShe recommended Applicant for a security clearance. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. India is a democratic republic \nwith a cooperative relationship with the United States. The United States recognizes \nIndia as a key to strategic U.S. interests, and has sought to strengthen its relationship \nwith India. The United States and India have been committed to a strategic partnership \nthat has seen expanded cooperation in the areas of civilian nuclear activities, civilian \nspace programs, and technology trade. The United States is India's largest trading \npartner and investment partner. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nNotwithstanding, differences remain between the two countries, including \nconcerns about India\u2019s nuclear weapons program, abuses of human rights (although, \nthe Indian government is considered to generally respect the human rights of its \ncitizens), and its refusal to sign weapons non-proliferation treaties. Of grave concern is \nIndia\u2019s increasing cooperation and partnership with Iran and its military forces. Despite \nadvancements in the United States-Indian relations, India has been identified by the \nU.S. intelligence community as one of the most active collectors of sensitive U.S. \neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information. The United States has sanctioned \nIndian scientists and chemical companies for transferring to Iran weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD)-related equipment and/or technology. Additionally, there are \nnumerous documented cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his mother, siblings, and his in-laws. His \nmother and siblings are citizens and residents of India. The closeness of the \nrelationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone contacts with his mother and \nsiblings, his financial support to his parents, and his frequent trips to India to visit his \nfamily. Additionally, he has a bank account in India, owns a condo (a vacation home), \nand has a potential inheritance of a home in India. \n \nThese contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Indian agents may exploit the opportunity to \nobtain information about the United States. His connection to his in-laws and long-time \nIndian friends and colleagues also creates a potential conflict of interest because his \nrelationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help \nthem by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThese close relationships create a higher risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because of India\u2019s cooperation and partnership relationship with Iran, a \ncountry with interest inimical to the United States. His connections to his Indian family \nalso create a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close \nto raise a security concern about his desire to help his family by providing sensitive \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s frequent travel to India also creates a higher risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the Indian government, friends, and \nformer colleagues working as scientist for Indian institutions.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U. \nS.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply. Appellant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely \n[he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his Indian \nfamily] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close relationships with \nhis Indian family members could potentially force him to choose between the United \nStates and India. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that \n[his relationships with his Indian family members] could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nApplicant has traveled to India eight times since he immigrated to the United \nStates in 1983. He has plans to travel to India in 2008 to visit his mother and attend a \nniece\u2019s marriage. He and his wife became U.S. naturalized citizen in 1996. He has \ncontacts and close relationships with his mother, sisters, and with his wife\u2019s family who \nare citizens and residents of India. Applicant also has contacts and close relationship \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \nwith Indian friends (university professors and scientist), most of whom he has known \nand has remained in contact with since his college days in India.   \n \nThe nature of India\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. I considered that \nthe Indian government is a democratic republic with a cooperative relationship with the \nUnited States. India generally respects the human rights of its citizens. India is not a \nhostile country nor are its interests inimical to the United States. The United States and \nIndia enjoy good relations and the United States is India's largest trading partner.  \n \nNotwithstanding, India\u2019s aggressive collection of proprietary and economic \ninformation, its industrial espionage against the United States and its partnership with \nIran raises the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate \nfamily members in India do not pose a security risk and that he will not be placed into a \nposition to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his Indian \nfamily members.6 India\u2019s partnership with Iran raises further concerns. Iran has an \nadversarial stance with the United States, a negative human rights record, and it is likely \nthat Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather classified or sensitive \ninformation from the United States. \n \nApplicant received an Indian government scholarship to attend his PhD studies. \nHe worked for a prestigious Indian research institute (under the auspices of the Indian \ngovernment) for five years before coming to the United States to attend post-doctorate \nstudies on a sabbatical. His brother-in-law is a scientist working for an Indian research \ninstitute, and he specializes in the same area Applicant does. Applicant keeps contact \nwith college friends and colleagues from his days at the Indian institute. Thus, it is more \nlikely the Indian government is monitoring Applicant\u2019s work, his trips to India, and his \ncommunications with family and friends.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United \nStates for approximately 25 years. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for around 12 \nyears. His children have inculcated U.S. values. Applicant and his wife have established \nthemselves as successful American citizens. He has worked hard for numerous \nemployers in the United States, and continues his track record of diligent labor.  \n \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAvailable evidence suggests Applicant is truthful, honest, and conscientious \nabout security matters. His current supervisor testified he has followed the rules and \nregulations set forth by his company to protect classified information. His participation \nas a guest speaker at an Indian research institute symposium was sanctioned by his \nemployer. AG \u00b6 8(d) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1. f.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s information suggests his financial and business interests in the United \nStates are valued at around $1.3 million. In contrast, the value of his bank account and \ncondo in India equals around $86,000. Applicant failed to provide information \nconcerning the estimated value of the house he inherited from his father, but has not \naccepted. AG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant strongly averred he and his family are loyal Americans, that they have \nwoven themselves into the fabric or America through their long-term participation in the \ncommunity, their volunteer work, and their jobs. Applicant has lived in the United States \nfor 25 years and has been a naturalized citizen for 12 years. When he became a U.S. \ncitizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His two sons are also U.S. citizens. \nThey were raised and educated in the United States as Americans. They are currently \nattending some of the best learning institutions the United States can offer. Applicant \ncredibly testified that he and his wife decided to become U.S. citizens when they \nrealized their sons were being brought up as Americans and it was not likely their sons \nwould leave the United States to go back to live in India. \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible. There is \nno reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm to \nhis sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States. There is no evidence he has ever taken \n\n \n11 \n \n \nany action which could cause potential harm to the United States, or that he lacks \nhonesty and integrity. He has the respect and trust of his supervisor and U.S. neighbor.   \n \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis: \nIndia\u2019s relationship with Iran, India\u2019s aggressively seeking sensitive or protected U.S. \ninformation, that Applicant was born and educated in India, he worked in Indian \nuniversities and at an Indian research institute for five years, and he maintains contact \nwith Indian friends and scientists. In sum, he had significant connections to India before \nhe immigrated to the United States \u2013 connections that he continues to maintian. \nApplicant has frequent and non-casual contact with his family members living in India. \nThese contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there \nis always the possibility that Indian agents or others hostile to U.S. interests may \nattempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in India to obtain information about the \nUnited States.  \n \n \nApplicant also failed to establish the value of the property he inherited in India. \nAs such, I cannot determine whether the value of all of his financial interest is such that \nit could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns \narising from her foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.l: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).1 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nNovember 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 10, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on January 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 5, 2008. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on February 29, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, \nwhich were admitted without objection (Tr. 20).2 Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nand presented the testimony of two witnesses and seven exhibits, marked AE A through \nG, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on March 10, 2008. I issued a decision denying eligibility for access to classified \ninformation on July 25, 2008. \n \nAppellate Litigation \n \n \nApplicant appealed my decision to deny his clearance. On October 9, 2008, the \nAppeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case.3 In his appeal, Applicant did not challenge \nmy findings of facts.4 I will restate in this decision the facts as they were covered in my \nfirst decision. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case for clarification of my decision. \nThe Appeal Board stated that: \n \nIn discussing MC 8(b), the Judge made the unqualified statement that \n\u201c[Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe United States\u2019 interests.\u201d Decision at 9. That conclusion is echoed in \nthe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis, in which he said that \u201c[t]here is no \nreason to believe that he would take any action which could cause \npotential harm to his sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States.\u201d Id. at 10. \nElsewhere in his decision, the Judge reached conclusions which appear to \nbe at odds with those quoted above, and the Judge stated at the end of \nhis decision that he had \u201cdoubts at to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and \nsuitability.\u201d Id. at 11. The Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion was a clearance \ndenial. While there is record evidence to support the negative conclusions \nand the ultimate denial, the Judge\u2019s statements above appear to \ncontradict his ultimate conclusion. The case is therefore remanded to the \nJudge for clarification.5 \n \nISCR Case No. 07-04281 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2008). \n \n2  GEs 6 & 7 were marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n3  ISCR Case No. 07-04281 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2008, Remand Decision). \n \n4  Id., at 2. \n \n5  Actually, my statement about the applicability of MC 8(b) stated that this mitigating condition \npartially applied. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior professional staff (scientist) working at a U.S. \nuniversity. He was born, raised, and educated in India. He received his bachelor\u2019s, \nmaster\u2019s, and PhD degrees in India. His parents paid for his education up to his \nmaster\u2019s degree. He received a full scholarship from the Indian government to attend \nhis PhD studies at a prestigious Indian institute (Tr. 25-26). After completing his PhD, \nApplicant became a member of the faculty (lecturer) at the Indian institute, and worked \nthere for five years (Tr. 25, 75-83). He still maintains contact with some of his friends \nfrom college and with colleagues from his days at the Indian research institute. He has \ntelephone contact with his colleagues once a year, exchanges e-mails sporadically with \nthem, and he visits them when he is in India (Tr. 95). \n \nIn 1983, Applicant took a sabbatical from the Indian institute to attend post-\ndoctoral studies at a U.S. university. At the end of his studies, he was offered a two-year \nposition and then, a permanent job at the university. He traveled back to India to consult \nwith his family about his job opportunity. He took the U.S. job and worked at the \nuniversity for a period of time. After working for a second U.S. employer, in 1989, \nApplicant was hired by his current employer (Tr. 30, 75). \n \nIn 1979, Applicant married his Indian-born spouse in India (GE 1). She was a \nstudent at the same university he attended. They have two sons born of this marriage, \nages 27, and 18 (Tr. 25-26). In 1996, Applicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. They decided to become U.S. citizens because their sons were growing up and \nwere being educated as Americans. Their older son came to the United States when he \nwas two years old, and their younger son was born in the United States. Applicant \nbelieves his sons would never leave the United States to go back to live in India (Tr. \n32). Applicant and his wife enjoy living and working in the United States. She has \nworked for a large U.S. bank for the last 20 years. She holds a vice-president position at \nthe bank (Tr. 32). \n \nApplicant\u2019s two sons are exceptional students. The eldest attended some of the \nfinest graduate and post-graduate institutions the United States can offer, and is \ncurrently attending post-doctoral studies. The youngest is following in his brother\u2019s \nfootsteps (Tr. 60-61). Applicant\u2019s evidence credibly shows his sons were raised as \nAmericans and are well integrated into the American culture. They were encouraged to \nparticipate in school activities, to run for student counsel positions, and to volunteer in \ncommunity activities. Applicant and his wife set the example for their sons with their \ninvolvement in community activities and their volunteer work (AE D, E, F). \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s immediate and extended family members are \nresidents and citizens of India. He has close ties of affection and/or obligation with his \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmother and two sisters. He has telephonic contact with his mother at least twice a \nmonth. They talk about family issues and her health. They never discuss his business or \nwork related matters. Applicant\u2019s sisters (A and B) are both married, each has two \nchildren and they are homemakers. Sister A\u2019s husband was the general manager for a \nnationalized bank in India. He retired in 2008, and now works in the private sector (Tr. \n40, 78). Sister B\u2019s husband worked as a scientist for an Indian government sponsored \nresearch laboratory. He specialized in the same scientific field as Applicant. Applicant \nbelieves he is now retired and works as an emeritus professor for a government institute \n(Tr. 41, 79, 107). Applicant has telephonic contact with his sisters once or twice a \nmonth; they exchange e-mails sporadically, and he visits with them whenever he is in \nIndia (Tr. 43, 94). \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 78 years old, and owns a small pharmacy in India. His \nwife is a 68-year-old homemaker. His wife talks to her parents once a week. Applicant \npartakes in the telephone conversations whenever his wife talks to her parents and he \nis around (Tr. 43). Applicant\u2019s wife has two brothers and two sisters. One of her two \nbrothers is a doctor at a private hospital. Her other brother is an accountant who used to \nwork for a quasi-government agency. He now works as a private consultant (Tr. 44). \nApplicant\u2019s wife claimed she has contact with her brothers approximately three times a \nyear. One of her sister\u2019s husband owns a store. Her sister is a homemaker. The second \nsister and her husband are both deaf and mute (Tr. 116). \n \nIn 1998, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law (a scientist and faculty member of an Indian \nresearch institute) and the Director of the Indian research institute invited Applicant to \nbe the guest speaker at a scientific symposium. The Indian research institute is under \nthe auspices of the Indian government. Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor authorized him \nto attend the symposium. He was required to speak only about information that had \nbeen published (Tr. 45, 76). There is no evidence Applicant has compromised or \ncaused the compromise of classified information. \n \nAround 2001-2002, Applicant opened a bank account in India. The purpose of \nthe bank account was to facilitate providing financial support to his parents. He provided \nfinancial support to his parents since 1985 (Tr. 97). In 2006, he was providing around \n$150-$200 a month. When his father died, he decided to stop providing support for his \nmother because she no longer needed it. He kept money in an Indian bank account in \nthe event his mother had an emergency situation. As of the hearing day, the account \nhad a value of approximately $6,000. He also opened the bank account to facilitate his \npurchase of real estate property in India (Tr. 48-49, 83).  \n \nIn 2003, Applicant bought a condominium for his mother\u2019s intermittent use (Tr. \n50). He claimed when his mother no longer needs it, he will dispose of the condo. He \nestimated the value of the condo to be around $80,000 (Tr. 80). Applicant\u2019s father died \nin 2006, and in his will, he left Applicant the family home. His mother lives in the home. \nApplicant has not accepted the inheritance, and is debating whether to do so. He did not \nprovide an estimated value for the property he inherited from his father. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSince his arrival to the United States in 1983, Applicant has travelled frequently \nback to India to visit his family and to participate in family events. He travelled to India in \n1986, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2007. He also plans to visit his mother \nand attend a niece\u2019s wedding during the later part of 2008 (Tr. 56, 89-94). \n \nApplicant never discusses his work with any of his relatives, including his mother, \nsiblings, and in-laws (Tr. 66). He also averred he never discusses classified information \nwith his brother-in-law (scientist) or any of his friends and colleagues from his days \nworking for Indian research institutions. Applicant is a loyal American. He promised to \nreport to his employer and the FBI any inquiries about his work and/or any possible \nthreat against the United States from any foreigners, U.S. citizens, or from his family \nmembers (Tr. 66).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of his supervisor/manager and \na long-time neighbor. The supervisor has known, worked with, and supervised Applicant \nduring the last 10 years on a daily basis. She considers Applicant to be a hard-working, \nethical, and dedicated employee. He is perceived as being truthful, honest, and \nconscientious about enforcement of security rules. According to his supervisor, \nApplicant has always followed the rules and procedures to protect classified information. \nShe recommended Applicant for a security clearance. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. India is a democratic republic \nwith a cooperative relationship with the United States. The United States recognizes \nIndia as a key to strategic U.S. interests, and has sought to strengthen its relationship \nwith India. The United States and India have been committed to a strategic partnership \nthat has seen expanded cooperation in the areas of civilian nuclear activities, civilian \nspace programs, and technology trade. The United States is India's largest trading \npartner and investment partner. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, differences remain between the two countries, including \nconcerns about India\u2019s nuclear weapons program, abuses of human rights (although, \nthe Indian government is considered to generally respect the human rights of its \ncitizens), and its refusal to sign weapons non-proliferation treaties. Of grave concern is \nIndia\u2019s increasing cooperation and partnership with Iran and its military forces. Despite \nadvancements in the United States-Indian relations, India has been identified by the \nU.S. intelligence community as one of the most active collectors of sensitive U.S. \neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information. The United States has sanctioned \nIndian scientists and chemical companies for transferring to Iran weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD)-related equipment and/or technology. Additionally, there are \nnumerous documented cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d7 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n6  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n7  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                     \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.8 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his mother, siblings, and his in-laws. His \nmother and siblings are citizens and residents of India. The closeness of the \nrelationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone contacts with his mother and \nsiblings, his financial support to his parents, and his frequent trips to India to visit his \nfamily. Additionally, he has a bank account in India, owns a condo (a vacation home), \nand has a potential inheritance of a home in India. \n \nThese contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Indian agents may exploit the opportunity to \nobtain information about the United States. His connection to his in-laws and long-time \nIndian friends and colleagues also creates a potential conflict of interest because his \nrelationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to help \nthem by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThese close relationships create a higher risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because of India\u2019s cooperation and partnership relationship with Iran, a \ncountry with interest inimical to the United States. His connections to his Indian family \nalso create a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close \nto raise a security concern about his desire to help his family by providing sensitive \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s frequent travel to India also creates a higher risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the Indian government, friends, and \nformer colleagues working as scientist for Indian institutions.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U. \nS.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \n \n8  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not fully apply and do not mitigate the security \nconcerns raised. Appellant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of [his Indian family] and the interests of the \nU.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close relationships with his Indian family members \ncould potentially force him to choose between the United States and India. He did not \nmeet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with his Indian \nfamily members] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nApplicant has traveled to India eight times since he immigrated to the United \nStates in 1983. He has plans to travel to India in 2008 to visit his mother and attend a \nniece\u2019s marriage. He and his wife became U.S. naturalized citizen in 1996. He has \ncontacts and close relationships with his mother, sisters, and with his wife\u2019s family who \nare citizens and residents of India. Applicant also has contacts and close relationship \nwith Indian friends (university professors and scientist), most of whom he has known \nand has remained in contact with since his college days in India.   \n \nThe nature of India\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. I considered that \nthe Indian government is a democratic republic with a cooperative relationship with the \nUnited States. India generally respects the human rights of its citizens. India is not a \nhostile country nor are its interests inimical to the United States. The United States and \nIndia enjoy good relations and the United States is India's largest trading partner.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nNotwithstanding, India\u2019s aggressive collection of proprietary and economic \ninformation, its industrial espionage against the United States and its partnership with \nIran raises the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate \nfamily members in India do not pose a security risk and that he will not be placed into a \nposition to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his Indian \nfamily members.9 India\u2019s partnership with Iran raises further concerns. Iran has an \nadversarial stance with the United States, a negative human rights record, and it is likely \nthat Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather classified or sensitive \ninformation from the United States. \n \nApplicant received an Indian government scholarship to attend his PhD studies. \nHe worked for a prestigious Indian research institute (under the auspices of the Indian \ngovernment) for five years before coming to the United States to attend post-doctorate \nstudies on a sabbatical. His brother-in-law is a scientist working for an Indian research \ninstitute, and he specializes in the same area Applicant does. Applicant keeps contact \nwith college friends and colleagues from his days at the Indian institute. Thus, it is more \nlikely the Indian government is monitoring Applicant\u2019s work, his trips to India, and his \ncommunications with family and friends.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not fully apply and does not mitigate the security concerns \nraised. It partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States and should be given credit for his connections to the United \nStates. He has lived in the United States for approximately 25 years. He has been a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen for around 12 years. His children have inculcated U.S. values. \nApplicant and his wife have established themselves as successful American citizens. \nHe has worked hard for numerous employers in the United States, and continues his \ntrack record of diligent labor. However, when his favorable information is balanced \nagainst his contact with foreign persons, which is substantial, there is a potential conflict \nof interest, resulting in the foreign influence concern. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not mitigate the security concerns raised because Applicant has \nsignificant contacts with family members, friends, and professional associates who are \nresidents and citizens of India. Such contacts create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation because of the Indian government\u2019s active collection of sensitive U.S. \neconomic, industrial, and proprietary information. This is documented by cases involving \nthe illegal export, or attempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to \nIndia. The concerns are further documented by Indian scientists and companies \ntransferring to Iran (a nation with adverse interests to the United States) weapons of \nmass destruction (WMD)-related equipment and/or technology.  \n \n \n9 See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very \nheavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran).  \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThere is a heightened risk that the Indian government, or Applicant\u2019s contacts in \nIndia, may attempt to exploit Applicant directly, or by exploiting Applicant\u2019s family and \nfriends in India. Applicant\u2019s situation creates a potential conflict of interest between \nApplicant\u2019s obligations to protect sensitive information and his desire/obligation to help \nhimself, or his family and friends were they under exploitation by a foreign interest. \n \nAvailable evidence suggests Applicant is truthful, honest, and conscientious \nabout security matters. His current supervisor testified he has followed the rules and \nregulations set forth by his company to protect classified information. His participation \nas a guest speaker at an Indian research institute symposium was sanctioned by his \nemployer. AG \u00b6 8(d) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s information suggests his financial and business interests in the United \nStates are valued at around $1.3 million. In contrast, the value of his bank account and \ncondo in India equals around $86,000. Applicant failed to provide information \nconcerning the estimated value of the house he inherited from his father, but has not \naccepted. AG \u00b6 8(f) does not fully apply and does not mitigate the security concerns \nraised because Applicant failed to establish that the value or routine nature of the \nforeign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in \na conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure him.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s favorable information is summarized as follows. \nApplicant and his family are loyal Americans, that they have woven themselves into the \nfabric or America through their long-term participation in the community, their volunteer \nwork, and their jobs. Applicant has lived in the United States for 25 years and has been \na naturalized citizen for 12 years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance \n\n \n12 \n \n \nto the United States. His two sons are also U.S. citizens. They were raised and \neducated in the United States as Americans. They are currently attending some of the \nbest learning institutions the United States can offer. Applicant credibly testified that he \nand his wife decided to become U.S. citizens when they realized their sons were being \nbrought up as Americans and it was not likely their sons would leave the United States \nto go back to live in India. \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible. There is \nno reason to believe that Applicant, without external influence, would take any action \nwhich could cause potential harm to his sons\u2019 and his lifestyle in the United States. \nThere is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to \nthe United States, or that he lacks honesty and integrity. He has the respect and trust of \nhis supervisor and U.S. neighbor.   \n \n \nOn the other hand, numerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the \nwhole person analysis: India\u2019s relationship with Iran, India\u2019s aggressively seeking \nsensitive or protected U.S. information, that Applicant was born and educated in India, \nhe worked in Indian universities and at an Indian research institute for five years, and he \nmaintains contact with Indian friends and scientists. In sum, he had significant \nconnections to India before he immigrated to the United States \u2013 connections that he \ncontinues to maintain. Applicant has frequent and non-casual contact with his family \nmembers living in India. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because there is always the possibility that Indian agents or others hostile \nto U.S. interests may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in India to obtain \ninformation about the United States.  \n \n \nApplicant also failed to establish the value of the property he inherited in India. \nAs such, I cannot determine whether the value of all of his financial interest is such that \nit could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns \narising from her foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.l: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Casey J. LeClair, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial history. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 19, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December 3, \n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008, as amended on January \n15, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 29, 2008. The government \nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through H, without objection. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 11, 2007, to submit \nadditional matters.  Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted AE J though M, without objection.1 \nThe attorney\u2019s letter is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is \nHE II. The record closed on February 11, 2007. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 19, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e. and 1.h of the SOR, with explanations. She \nadmitted in part and denied in part the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g of the SOR, \nwith explanations. She also provided additional information to support her request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She attended \ncollege but did not obtain a degree. She is remarried after a divorce. Her husband is a \nsenior enlisted member of the U.S. military. She is pregnant and has an 11-year-old \nchild and two step-children, ages 18 and 17.2  \n \n \nApplicant has several delinquent debts. Applicant and her former husband \nstarted a business selling items over the internet in about 1998. In 2000, Applicant went \nto work for her current employer at a low wage. She also continued to assist her \nhusband with the internet business. The inventory was purchased with credit cards in \nApplicant\u2019s name. Although the cards were in her name, Applicant\u2019s husband took care \nof the finances and paid all the bills. He let many of the bills go unpaid without \nApplicant\u2019s knowledge. Her husband was physically and mentally abusive. They \nseparated in 2002 and divorced in 2003. Applicant and her husband were awarded joint \ncustody of their child. The child stayed most of the time with Applicant but would visit \nthe father during the summers and every other weekend. There was no child or spousal \nsupport ordered.3  \n                                                          \n1 The exhibits were pre-marked by Applicant\u2019s counsel. I did not re-mark them. There was no AE I \nsubmitted. \n \n2 Tr. at 23-25, 93; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 20, 27- 33, 66-68; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was employed after the separation, but she earned a relatively low \nsalary. She had child care and basic living expenses that equaled or exceeded her \nsalary. From 2002 through 2005, she was unable to pay all the debts that had \naccumulated prior to the divorce and she accrued some additional delinquent debts.4   \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant moved to the state where her current husband is stationed. \nShe was able to obtain another job with the same company in the new state. Her child \nremained in the original state with her former husband. Applicant incurred about \n$20,000 in legal fees attempting to obtain custody of her child. In 2007, her original \nstate granted Applicant custody of her child and permitted the child to move to \nApplicant\u2019s current state of residence. The court also ordered her former husband to \npay $200 per month in child support.5   \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions, signed on May 25, \n2006. She listed several financial issues on the questionnaire. In the summer of 2006, \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator for her background investigation.  \nApplicant discussed her delinquent debts with the investigating agent. Applicant told him \nthat she wanted to pay her delinquent debts. The agent advised her that she should pay \nher largest debts first and then work downward to the smallest debts. Applicant had \nalready started repaying her creditors in about 2005. She decided to follow the agent\u2019s \nadvice and worked on paying the largest debts first. Applicant and her husband \ninstituted a budget where she would use a large part of her salary to pay her delinquent \ndebts.6 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $38,306. She \npaid or settled four debts. Two payments were made on one debt which either cleared \nthe debt or left a balance of about $163. Applicant has payment plans on two of the \ndebts and has paid approximately $1,800 toward those debts. Applicant plans on paying \nthe last debt in about August 2008, with a loan from her retirement account. Applicant \nhas cleared approximately $19,400 of the total amount owed of $38,306, leaving \napproximately $18,900 still owed. Individual debts are discussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a judgment of $6,369 awarded in 2005, for delinquent credit \ncard debt. The debt was incurred in 1998 to 2002, as part of the expenses for Applicant \nand her ex-husband\u2019s internet company. Court documents submitted by Applicant show \nthe $6,369 judgment plus $236 court costs and $955 in attorney\u2019s fees. Applicant \nadmitted to this debt and has instituted a payment plan. She has made payments of \n$250 in July, August and October, 2007. She paid $50 in January 2008. Two payments \nof $125 each are pending.7 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 35-37. \n \n5 Tr. at 33-38, 94. \n \n6 Tr. at 24, 40-43, 53; GE 1. \n \n7 Tr. at 47-51; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2; AE A, L. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe debt of $469 in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for wireless telephone service. After the \nhearing, Applicant made a payment of $153 on February 8, 2008, and scheduled a \npayment of $153 for February 21, 2008. Applicant submitted payment records from her \ncredit union to substantiate the payments. Handwritten on the credit union document \nare the words, \u201cacct paid.\u201d Applicant either settled the debt with these two payments or \nstill owes a small amount.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the $2,862 debt to a university, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant chose to address her larger debts first. She plans on paying this debt in about \nAugust 2008, with a loan from her retirement fund.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent debt of approximately $16,231 for a credit card \ndebt. The debt was incurred in 1998 to 2002, as part of the expenses for the failed \ninternet company. The creditor agreed to settle the debt for half the amount owed if \nApplicant adhered to a payment plan of $500 per month. Applicant made $500 \npayments each month from about September 2005 through September 2007. The \ncreditor lists this debt on the most recent credit bureau reports (CBR) as paid with a \nzero balance.10 \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the debt of $11,352 to a financial institution, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. This is a credit card debt that was incurred prior to 2002. Applicant has a \npayment plan with the creditor in which $150 is automatically deducted from her credit \nunion each month. Applicant submitted evidence of $150 payments in August, \nSeptember, October, November, and December 2007.11 \n \n \nApplicant paid the debt of $126 to a collection company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nThe debt was paid before January 2007.12 The CBR of June 14, 2006 lists a debt of \n$776. The original amount of the debt is listed as $1,455. This debt was for an \napartment that Applicant lived in after she separated from her husband. Applicant \nsettled this debt for $990.13 In October and November 2006, Applicant made two \npayments of $10 each and two payments of $25 each to the cable company, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. She paid the remaining $121 owed to the cable company on January 30, \n2008.14 \n \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 59-60; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 5; AE B, E. \n \n9 Tr. at 56-58; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. at 49-50; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 5; AE B, E. \n \n11 Tr. at 55-56; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE C, K. \n \n12 Tr. at 59-60; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4, 5; AE D. \n \n13 Tr. at 60, 69; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE F. \n \n14 Tr. at 60-61, 81-84; AE G, H, L. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant plans on paying all her delinquent debts. She chose not to file for \nbankruptcy because she felt a moral obligation to pay her debts. She has not received \nfinancial counseling.15 \n \n \nApplicant received raises, promotions, and positive performance evaluations at \nher company. Her security manager has known her for two years and works with her on \na daily basis. He described Applicant as a person of high moral character, organized, \nefficient, extremely competent, professional, solid, law abiding, responsible, and \ntrustworthy.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n                                                          \n15 Tr. at 70, 95; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n \n16 Tr. at 21-22; AE M. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated several delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant and her former husband accumulated credit card debt in an \nunsuccessful internet business. He was physically and mentally abusive and they \nseparated in 2002, leaving her accountable for the credit card debt.  From 2002 to 2005, \nApplicant was a single mother and barely made ends meet. She moved to another state \nin 2005, where her new husband was stationed, leaving her child with her former \nhusband. She spent $20,000 in legal fees and obtained custody of her child in 2007. \nApplicant chose not to file for bankruptcy and felt a moral obligation to pay her debts. \nHer husband is supportive of her endeavor to pay her delinquent debts. She started \nrepaying her debts in 2005, before she applied for a security clearance in 2006.  \n \n \nThe SOR listed $38,306 in delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s legal expenses slowed \nher ability to repay the debts, but she still managed to clear approximately $19,400 of \nthat amount. She has approximately $18,900 left to pay. She has payment plans in \neffect with two of the remaining debts and has made regular payments on those debts. \nThe only remaining debt that Applicant has not acted on is the $2,862 debt to her \ncollege. Applicant credibly testified that she will pay this debt in full in about August \n2008, with a loan from her retirement fund. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were related \nto a failed business, her husband not accepting responsibility for the business debts, \nand her living on low wages as a single mother after her divorce.  These are conditions \nthat were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. She met her new husband and started \nrepaying her debts in 2005, before they became an issue for her security clearance. \nThat is acting responsibly under the circumstances and constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) are applicable. She has not received \ncounseling but there are clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant went through a difficult \nmarriage and an unsuccessful internet business. After her divorce she barely made \nenough money to cover her living expenses as a single mother. She met her new \nhusband who is supportive of her intent to pay her delinquent debts. She started paying \nback her delinquent debts in 2005. She has established a proven track record that she \nwill adhere to her payment plans to address her remaining debts. Applicant is well \nregarded by her company. Her finances are now in order and no longer a security \nconcern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEDWARD W.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts for about $19,952 in total, which Applicant admits. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. Applicant is a 59-year-old military analyst/senior logistician. He has worked for his current employer since February 1999. Applicant has been married since 1976.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn Bayard Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Although he is making progress in resolving\nhis indebtedness, it is likely that his financial problems will continue or recur. Applicant did not\npresent sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security\nconcern. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on August 17, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and\nit details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nApplicant replied to the SOR in an undated response and requested a hearing. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on November 6, 2007, and the transcript was received on November 14,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts for about $19,952 in total, which\nApplicant admits. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old military analyst/senior logistician. He has worked for his current\nemployer since February 1999.  \nApplicant has been married since 1976. He and his wife have two children, sons, who are\nboth young adults who do not depend on their parents for financial support. Applicant\u2019s wife is not\nemployed outside the home, although she is currently looking for a job. Applicant and his wife have\nlived at the same address since 1994. \nApplicant served nearly 25 years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force. He retired in 1991 at\nthe rank of master sergeant (pay grade E7). During the last ten years of his military service,\nApplicant traveled frequently for business, approximately 100 days annually. As a result, his spouse\nmanaged their finances. After his retirement, this practice or habit continued and is essentially the\nway they manage their finances today, as Applicant still does a fair amount of business travel. \n\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. It is established by an April 2006 credit report\nand an August 2007 credit report (Exhibits 2 and 3). For example, the first credit report lists 30\naccounts in the trade section of the report, of which 3 accounts are described as 120 days or more\npast due and 8 accounts are described as a bad debt, placed for collection. The second credit report\nconfirms Applicant\u2019s adverse financial history as of August  2007.\nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in April 2006 (Exhibit 1). He met with\nan investigator in approximately October 2006 (R. 40, 43). He did not know about his adverse\nfinancial condition until he was shown a credit report during the interview. Indeed, he admits that\nhe was totally disengaged from the household finances (R. 92). He described seeing the credit report\nas a \u201ctwo-by-four across my nose\u201d that resulted in he and his wife having serious discussions and\nhe now believes he is on the road to repairing his financial condition (R. 43). He admits that he has\nplayed a \u201cvery limited\u201d role in repayment of the debts (R. 61). \nIn May 2007, Applicant took a $41,000 loan against his 401(k) retirement account (Exhibit\n4). He used the loan proceeds to pay debts. He paid $20,444 to a law firm to resolve three accounts,\n(Exhibits 4 and D). He paid $10,532 to a law firm to resolve one account (Exhibit 4). And he paid\n$4,585 to a collection agency to resolve one account (Exhibit 4). After making these payments, about\n$5,500 remained, and Applicant believes it may have gone toward a son\u2019s college expenses, but he\ndoes not know for certain (R. 82\u201383).\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns a charged-off credit card account for about $13,031.\nApplicant admits this debt is his obligation. The debt is now being collected by a law firm and\nApplicant made an initial $300 payment in August 2007 (Exhibit A). According to a budget prepared\nby his wife, Applicant has budgeted $100 monthly for repayment of this debt (Exhibit D). The\naccount\u2019s current balance is about $14,553.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b concerns a collection account (originally a credit card account) for\nabout $4,379. Applicant admits this debt is his obligation. In June 2007, Applicant settled this\naccount for $4,365 (Exhibits B). This payment may account for the $5,500 remaining from the\n401(k) loan proceeds, but the record is not clear on this point.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c concerns a collection account (originally a credit card account) for\nabout $2,542. Applicant admits this debt is his obligation. A law firm is handling the account, and\nApplicant began making payments in August 2006 (Exhibit C). Since then, he has made\napproximately ten payments of various amounts ranging from $185 to $1,200 for a total amount paid\nof $4,685. According to the budget, Applicant has budgeted $100 monthly for repayment of this debt\nand the account\u2019s current balance is about $3,000 (Exhibit D). \nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant is repaying three delinquent debts (originally\ncredit card accounts) to collection agencies (Exhibit D). According to the budget, the outstanding\nbalances for these three debts are $7,953, $4,100, and $4,308, for a total of $16,361. Applicant has\nbudgeted $100 monthly for repayment of each of these debts.\nConcerning his overall financial situation, Applicant\u2019s annual salary is nearly $70,000. His\ngross monthly salary is about $5,824 or $2,912 per pay period (Exhibit D at 4). In addition to his\nsalary, his net military retirement pay is about $15,500 annually or $1,290 monthly.  \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n4\nAccording to the budget, Applicant\u2019s total net monthly income is about $4,188 (Exhibit D).\nHousehold expenses are estimated at $1,268 monthly. Payments on four credit card accounts and one\ngas card account are estimated at $490 monthly. All five of these accounts are current. Mortgage\npayments (including a second mortgage) and other debt payments are estimated at $2,169 monthly.\nTotal monthly debt payments are $2,659. The result is a positive cash flow or net remainder of about\n$261. \nThese numbers do not include the approximate $834 monthly that is automatically deducted\nfrom Applicant\u2019s salary for repayment of the 401(k) loan at the rate of $417 per pay period. So far,\nApplicant has repaid $4,175 on the loan (Exhibit D at 4). \nApplicant obtained a second mortgage of $40,000 in about 1995 (R. 85). The monthly\npayment is about $469, and the balance has been reduced to about $25,000 (Exhibit D). The\nproceeds were used to \u201cclean up some bills\u201d (R. 85).  \nApplicant is current with the two mortgage payments. He has no car payments, and both he\nand his wife drive late model cars. He is current with his federal and state income tax obligations.\nBecause he was disengaged from his household\u2019s finances, Applicant does not really know\nwhat happened to the money that caused the indebtedness. He attributes the indebtedness to credit\ncards (R. 88-89). \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n5\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n15\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n DC 5 is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\n18\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\n6\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability to satisfy debts16\nand a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record\n17\nevidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. In addition, the\nrecord evidence supports a conclusion of consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means as indicated by\nthe excessive indebtedness incurred over a period of years, likely dating back to at least 1995 when\nApplicant took a second mortgage to resolve some bills.   \n18\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and two deserve\ndiscussion. First, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s control\u2014does not apply. First, his\nspouse\u2019s use of credit cards that generated excessive indebtedness was a circumstance beyond his\ncontrol. The MC does not apply, however, because Applicant\u2019s  disengagement from his family\u2019s\nfinances is not reasonable conduct under the circumstances. Once  he was confronted with the\nadverse credit report in October 2006, Applicant should have become fully engaged in managing his\nfinances, but that is not the case.  \nSecond, the most pertinent mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Applicant has taken positive\nsteps to resolve the debts. He used the 401(k) loan to resolve several debts, including settling the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He is making monthly payments on five delinquent credit card debts, including\nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. He is current with five other credit/gas cards and his mortgage\npayments, and he has no car payments. He has a positive monthly cash flow after paying household\nexpenses and all debt payments, including the 401(k) loan. Given these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s\nactions are sufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. In\naddition, the current circumstances suggest he is living within his means. \nThis case presents both disqualifying and mitigating information, which requires thoughtful\nbalancing. Applicant is 59 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his\nfinances and money-management practices. He has made progress in resolving his outstanding debts\nsince learning about his adverse credit report in October 2006. Nevertheless, he is servicing his debts\nat a minimal level (e.g., $100 monthly payments), and it will take years to eliminate the delinquent\ndebts at this rate of repayment. In addition, it appears that his total monthly debt payments of $2,659\nare consuming a large amount of his available income, which puts him in some financial jeopardy.\nOf concern here is Applicant\u2019s lack of involvement in managing his finances. He was totally\ndisengaged until confronted with the credit report. Since then he has had limited involvement. It\nappears his spouse is still primarily responsible for their finances. Given these circumstances, viewed\nin conjunction with the indebtedness that necessitated the second mortgage in 1995, it is more likely\nthan not that the financial problems will continue or recur. \n\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n22\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n23\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.24\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less\n25\nthan a preponderance.\u201d  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven\n26\nconduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.27\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas\n28\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n29\non the side of denial.\u201d30\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\n\n6\nForeign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC). FI DC 7(a)\n(contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), FI DC 7(b) (connections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information), FI DC 7(d) (sharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), and FI DC 7(e) (a\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\nor foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation). Applicant\u2019s wife, one sister, and brother are dual citizens of Hong Kong\nand the U.S. Both of his sisters reside in Hong Kong, with one being a citizen of Hong Kong. His\nbrother resides in the U.S. His father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong. No substantive\ninformation was provided to determine Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships with those living in\nHong Kong. I find Applicant has not provided enough information about his relatives, his contact\nwith them, and other important information to mitigate the security issues raised. There is a\npresumption that the relationship with his wife is more than casual and infrequent. Hong Kong is part\nof China and the Chinese government views citizens and resident of Hong Kong as Chinese. The\nrelationships that Applicant maintains create a heightened risk. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s father lives in\nHong Kong which magnifies the heightened risk. Without more information, I find there is a\npotential for a conflict of interest. Therefore, FI DC 7(a), (b), and (d) apply. Although nothing was\nprovided to confirm that Applicant divested himself from his bank account, I find the amount in it\nis not substantial in relation to his other assets and FI DC 7(d) does not apply.\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) and especially\nconsidered FI MC 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of\nthe foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), FI MC 8(b)\n(the nature of the relationships with the foreign person, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), and FI MC 8(c)\n(contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation). Applicant has not\nprovided enough information regarding his relationships with his relatives. As stated earlier it is\n\n7\npresumed he has more than a casual relationship with his wife. The country of China, of which Hong\nKong is a part, has a bad human rights record, is known to target its people and is one of the most\nactive collectors of industrial, military and proprietary secrets. Considering the lack of information\nand the evidence as a whole, I do not find any of the mitigating conditions applicable. Applicant\nsimply has too many connections with citizens of Hong Kong. His wife\u2019s status makes her especially\nvulnerable, especially with her father still in Hong Kong. Applicant\u2019s siblings status also makes him\nvulnerable, without additional information to mitigate the concerns. \nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nGuidelines, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered all evidence provided and considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole\nperson, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the foreign\ninfluence concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly,\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nForeign Influence (Guideline B)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol. G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on July 2, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 16,\n1\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 15, 2008. The Government\nOctober 31, 2008\n\n2\noffered Exhibits (GE 1-5), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in\nhis own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE A-D), without objection. I held the record\nopen until October 22, 2008 so that Applicant could submit documents. The\nsubmissions were timely received and marked as (AE) E and (AE) F. Department\nCounsel did not object to the documents. DOHA received the transcript on October 22,\n2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 17, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e, 1.j., 1.k., 1.n.,1.o., and 1.p of the SOR. He denied the other\nallegations, including \u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR. He provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in June 1992. He served in the United States Navy (USN) from 1993 until\n2000. He has worked for his current employer since April 2005 (GE 1). Applicant held a\nsecurity clearance during his military career until the present (Tr. 26).\nApplicant married in 1997. He and his wife separated/divorced in 2001. He does\nnot have any children (Tr. 19). His wife opened many credit accounts while she was\nmarried to Applicant without his knowledge.\nApplicant had a difficult transition after leaving the military in 2000. He was\nunemployed for three months. When he did find employment, he did not have sufficient\nincome. His wife left the marriage and Applicant had her bills from the various credit\naccounts to pay as well as his living expenses. He fell behind in payments. \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts, including a vehicle repossession. The total\namount of debt that Applicant owes is approximately $40,000 (GE 7). The largest debt\nis $12,116 for a vehicle repossession in 2005. \nApplicant admitted owing a few debts listed in the SOR. Applicant has paid one\naccount (\u00b6 1.c for $986) (AE A). The other debts have not been paid. Applicant plans to\nrefinance his house this year and to use the proceeds to pay his delinquent debts. He\npurchased the house last year and believes the value is approximately $150,000.\nApplicant had not looked at his credit report prior to the security investigation. He\ndoes not recognize some of the debts. He attended a few financial counseling classes\nin 2006. He called a credit hot line to get information on his credit standing.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $3,922 (Tr. 75). After monthly\nexpenses he has a net remainder of approximately $681. He is paying on his current\ncar loan.\n\n3\nApplicant completed his July 18, 2005 security application. In that application he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to section 28(a) and (b) which asks for information on debts either 180\ndays delinquent in the last seven years or 90 days currently delinquent (GE 1 ).\nApplicant explained that he completed the security questionnaire online at home.\nHe indicated that he did not believe he had delinquent debts because the car was\nvoluntarily repossessed and the other accounts were in collection. He said it was a\nmisunderstanding. He was credible in his testimony that he had no intent to deceive the\ngovernment.  \nIn June 2006, Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance\nprocess. He explained his financial status and his delinquencies. He explained that he\npurchased a vehicle in 2000. He could not keep up with the payments after a year. He\nreturned the car to the dealer. He indicated that he did not recognize the names of\nsome of the accounts. He reported to the investigator that in his 2006 credit report the\ndebts were not listed. He did recognize the Navy Exchange account and the\nCitiFinancial account. He is now living with his girlfriend and they have a two-month-old\ndaughter (GE 4). \nApplicant is a trusted co-worker and friend. He has been trained how to deal with\nclassified materials and has never had an issue in that area (AE B). He has a high\ndegree of integrity and responsibility in the workplace. He is recommended for a\nsecurity clearance (AE C).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\njudgments and did not meet some of his financial obligations from 2000 until the present\ntime. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2000. He accumulated some delinquent debt due to his ex-\nwife and a few months of unemployment when he retired from the military. While those\ncircumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. He\nadmits that he paid one account. He paid one debt in the SOR and intends to refinance\nhis house to pay the rest. His conduct over the last six months with his creditors does\nnot removes security concerns or doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness,\nand good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has been\nsteadily employed except for three months after leaving the military. He did experience\nseparation and divorce but he also has debt that do not stem from that situation.\nApplicant was not as aggressive as he should have been in initially addressing or\nresolving his delinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant attended a few classes for financial counseling. He\nis investigating his credit report to dispute some accounts. He paid one account. I find\nhis efforts are insufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these potentially\nmitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that he called\nand contacted most of the creditors. He submitted a generic letter that he claims he sent\nto all creditors. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n6\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2005 security application, he did not\nlist any debts that were 90 or 180 days delinquent. He explained that he believed\nbecause the repossession was voluntary and the accounts were closed that he did not\nhave delinquent debts of 90 or 180 days. Despite the fact that the questionnaire was not\nchecked \u2018yes\u201d on either section, I found him credible. The allegation of falsification is\nunsubstantiated. I do not find that he deliberately provided false information on his SF\n86 in 2005.\nThus, Applicant\u2019s allegation of deliberate omission is mitigated under AG 17(f)\n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must\nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are not sufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant served in the USN for many years. After\nleaving the military, he had a difficult transition to civilian life. His wife left the marriage\nand he had many bills to pay. He has not been aggressive with his delinquent debts. His\n\n7\nplan of action is to refinance his house and use the proceeds to pay for the delinquent\ndebts. This plan is not in place at this time. He has disputed many accounts but did not\nprovide sufficient documentation for this proposition. He is now engaged and has an\ninfant daughter. He is working to provide for his family. However, at this time, Applicant\nhas not met his burden of proof to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d-p:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Applications (SF 86), on April 12, \n2005, and September 27, 2005. On October 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guidelines F (Financial) for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 5, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non December 17, 2007, and I received the case assignment on December 20, 2007. \nMarch 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008, for a hearing on January 31, \n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted five exhibits which were admitted without \nobjection. He and one witness testified on his behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 14, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open \nuntil March 14, 2008, to submit additional evidence. Two additional documents were \nreceived on February 14, 2008, and admitted without objection. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nNotice \nThe hearing notice was dated 15 days before the hearing date. I advised Applicant \nof his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant \naffirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated he was ready to proceed \n(Tr. 10).  \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted twelve of the sixteen allegations in \nthe SOR relating to approximately $29,000 in delinquent debts. He denied the other four \nallegations. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a government contractor working as a \npropellant mechanic since March 2005. He supervises ten people and has never held a \nsecurity clearance. He was married in 1997 and he and his wife bought a home and did \nnot budget wisely. He was injured soon thereafter and was out of work for nine months. \nTheir debts continued to grow and he was laid off from his former job in 2003 and took a \na low paying hourly job thereafter. He is now fully employed and earning more than he \ndid with his two former employers.  \nApplicant is well regarded by his present employer and his former employers for \nhis skill and dedication (Exhs. A, B, and F, and Tr. 62-65). He also has several excellent \ncharacter references from people who know him well (Exhs. C, D, and E). His wife and \nhe are expecting their first child after several years of working with a fertility clinic. They \nacquired another home in 2004 from a friend when they were unable to obtain financing. \nThe delinquent debts arose from two automobile repossessions, credit cards used \nfor household and trade expenses, and medical bills. A summary of the debts and their \nstatus based on testimony reveals the following (Tr. 30-48).  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n1. The two automobile repossessions constitute the largest of the delinquent debts \n(SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.b. and j. for $12,777 and $5,857) which occurred in 1997 and are unresolved  \nbut probably written off by the creditors.  \n2. There are five credit card debts used for living expenses listed on the SOR but \nthere are two duplicates which he denied in his answer (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.a. and g, and e. and \nf.). Thus, these four allegations are for only two debts of $949 and $793. The remaining \none is for $749 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.). None have been paid.  \n3. A single debt for $2,354 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) was for tools used in a former job from \nwhich he was laid off. He has not made payments on the debt since 2003. \n4, There are six medical debts of over $3,000 (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.k.-p.), the largest for \n$2,500 is for a fertility clinic used by Applicant\u2019s wife (SOR \u00b6 1.k.). Applicant thought this \nbill should have been covered by insurance but the claim was denied. The others are for \nsmall amounts and some have been delinquent for since 2004 and 2005. None have \nbeen paid.   \n5. He denied two debts one of which for $183 he had no recollection of but had not \ncalled the number listed on the credit report to find out (SOR \u00b6 1.h.). The second one for \n$968 (SOR \u00b6 1. i.) was for dish network equipment which he returned to the provider. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is now stable and he is current on expenses. His wife \nis the beneficiary of a trust established by her father which pays her $650 per month. He \nrecently received $30,000 by inheritance from his father. The funds from the inheritance \nwere used to pay the balance due on an expensive automobile he purchased before he \nreceived the inheritance (Tr. 52). He has also purchased a truck for $25,000 for which he \npays $255 per month by payroll withholding (Tr. 51). The trust fund payments to his wife \nare placed in a savings account when received and now total approximately $10,000 (Tr. \n72). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and was \nunable or unwilling to pay the obligations for several years. The evidence shows that he \nhas been able pay many, if not all, of the debts for the past year yet very little has been \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ndone to even contact the creditors. Thus, the evidence clearly raises these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Most of Applicant=s \nfinancial problems arose in the past ten years ago. He now has a job which pays a \nreasonable salary and his wife is employed. It seems likely that he will be able to resolve \nthe debts over time but all of them, some with significant amounts and others with small \namounts, remain unsatisfied. While he has excellent references and the support of his \nemployer, the delinquent debts does raise security concerns under the Guideline F. \nUnder AG & 20(b), the security concern may be mitigating where Athe conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As \nnoted above, some of the financial problems arose from his medical problems and \nperiods of unemployment and reduced income. However, he has been employed with a \nbetter income for three years with no payment or settlement of any of delinquent debts. \nRather than doing so, Applicant used the funds from his father\u2019s inheritance to pay the \nbalance on an expensive automobile and his wife is saving all the payments from her \ntrust.  \nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is \na potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. Applicant recently started credit counseling with the aim of \nresolving the delinquent debts but this only began after the hearing in this matter (Exh. \nG). While laudable, it is not timely. While it not necessary for mitigation to apply that all of \nthe delinquent debts be resolved, it is necessary that a significant portion of this many \ndebts be settled or paid. Even this test has not been met. Not a single debt listed in the \nSOR has been paid. Thus, I conclude that the mitigating conditions do not apply. \n \nThe debts cited in the SOR remain outstanding except for two (SOR \u00b6 1.e. and f.) \nthat are duplicates. Two of the four debts that he denied are duplicates and are mitigated. \nHowever, the dish network and fertility clinic debts (SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.i. and k.) appear to be \nvalid debts and his explanations to mitigate are not persuasive.  \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a young man in his early 20's (See AG & 2(a)(4)). He accumulated debt \nduring periods of unemployment and medical problems (See AG & 2(a)(2)). Since that \ntime he has obtained a better paying job, has received funds from an inheritance, but has \nnot resolved any of the debts. .  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance at this time. I recognize his interest to \nresolve these financial issues to restore his credit rating. However, the lack of action to \nresolve these delinquent debts over the past three years when he and his wife had extra \nincome from inheritances yet did nothing to use those funds to resolve his delinquent \ndebts, prompts me to conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom these financial considerations and that it is premature at this time to grant a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:   For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  Against Applicant \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p.:  Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nAccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n______________________ \nCharles D.

Applicant is 53 years old. He is a senior staff chemical engineer for a federal contractor for whom he has worked since May 1981. As a senior member of the staff, Applicant oversees many projects for the company. He is married and has three adult sons, one of whom lives at home. In May 1993, he earned a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Over the course of his employment, he received training in handling and storing classified information. (GE 2). He has held a Secret security clearance for 26 years. (Tr. 72). In the summer of 1990, Applicant began experiencing chronic joint and back pain. ln 1995, he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. His doctor prescribed various medications for his condition, including anti-inflammatory agents and specific anti- depressant drugs over the next several years. The medications were initially effective for periods of time, but eventually lost their efficacy. In early 2004, he began self- medicating with alcohol on a regular basis to relieve the pain.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on March 31, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c of the SOR, and offered explanations in support of his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He is a senior staff chemical engineer for a federal \ncontractor for whom he has worked since May 1981. As a senior member of the staff, \nApplicant oversees many projects for the company.  He is married and has three adult \nsons, one of whom lives at home.  In May 1993, he earned a Master of Science in \nMechanical Engineering. Over the course of his employment, he received training in \nhandling and storing classified information. (GE 2). He has held a Secret security \nclearance for 26 years. (Tr. 72).   \n \n \nIn the summer of 1990, Applicant began experiencing chronic joint and back \npain. ln 1995, he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. His doctor prescribed various \nmedications for his condition, including anti-inflammatory agents and specific anti-\ndepressant drugs over the next several years. The medications were initially effective \nfor periods of time, but eventually lost their efficacy. In early 2004, he began self-\nmedicating with alcohol on a regular basis to relieve the pain. (Tr. 74).  \n \n \nIn the fall of 2006, Applicant developed severe sciatica pain. When he met with a \ngovernment investigator for his security clearance interview in November 2006, he \nstated he had increased his evening alcohol consumption to approximately six to ten \nbeers each night over the course of several hours in order to manage his pain. (GE 3; \nTr. 76; 78; 87). Although he admitted in his Answer that he occasionally drank to excess \nor became mildly intoxicated, he does not believe he engaged in binge drinking or \nbecame intoxicated to the point of having impaired judgment while drinking at home. He \nnever placed himself in a position where his judgment could be a concern. (Answer; Tr. \n76; 77). \n \n \nDuring the first half of 2007, Applicant started attending physical therapy to \nrelieve the sciatica pain. After working with the physical therapist and doing exercises at \nhome for a period of time, the sciatica pain began to mitigate, as did the fibromyalgia \npain. By April and May of 2007, he moderated his alcohol consumption to two or three \nbeers a couple nights a week at home. (Tr. 89). He continued the therapy sessions until \nDecember 2007, when his insurance benefits ran out for that year.   \n \n \nAfter learning from a governmental investigator in June 2007 that his alcohol \nconsumption was jeopardizing his security clearance, Applicant immediately stopped \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndrinking and sought an independent alcohol and substance abuse evaluation, as \nrecommended by the investigator. (Tr. 62). On July 16, 2007, he met with a licensed \nsocial worker, certified in drug counseling, for an evaluation. After completing an alcohol \nand drug assessment, the counselor sent a report to the government investigator on \nJuly 31, 2008. He diagnosed Applicant as having an alcohol abuse disorder. (GE 4). He \nrecommended that Applicant participate in outpatient treatment, including individual \ncounseling, alcohol education, and seek help at a pain management clinic. He \nrecommended Applicant abstain from alcohol use. (Id.). Applicant did not receive a copy \nof that report until October 2, 2007, despite repeated calls to the counselor\u2019s clinic. \n \n \nAfter meeting with the government investigator in June 2007, Applicant did not \nconsume alcohol until his birthday in September 2007, when he had a couple beers with \nhis family at home. (Tr. 61). Over the past nine months he has had about 12 drinks, and \ncompletely stopped consuming alcohol on December 6, 2007. He is very aware of the \ndiagnosis he received from two health care providers and is committed to maintaining \nabstinence. (Tr. 60; 83-84; 90). Currently, he controls his pain through exercises and \nanti-inflammatory drugs.   \n \n \nOver the course of the years that Applicant was drinking, he was never arrested \nfor any alcohol related incidents, disorderly conduct, or intoxication. He generally never \ndrank outside of his home, unless he had a glass of wine with friends while socializing. \n(Tr. 61-61; 78-81).  He never went to work under the influence of alcohol, or received \nany type of disciplinary action related to alcohol consumption. None of his colleagues \never observed him intoxicated.    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified.  He has a Top-Secret security clearance. \nHe has known Applicant for four and a half years and been his supervisor since \nSeptember 2007. He interacts with Applicant on a daily basis. He has never observed \nApplicant under the influence of alcohol at work or during social events they attended. \nHe rated Applicant as \u201cexceptional\u201d in the 2007 annual performance evaluation, which \nincluded information and comments from other employees. (AE F). He supports \nApplicant\u2019s request for a Top-Secret security clearance. (Tr. 16-22). \n \n \nAnother colleague of Applicant testified. He has held a Secret clearance for 20 \nyears. He has known Applicant for 25 years and supervised him for four years, giving \nhim an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating each year. Although they interacted socially on occasion years \nago, their relationship has essentially been of a professional nature. He has never \nobserved Applicant under the influence of alcohol or medication. He initiated Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a Top-Secret security clearance.  He does not have any reservations or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or ability to handle \nclassified information. (Tr. 23-29). Several other colleagues have similar opinions of \nApplicant and those opinions were considered in his previous evaluations. (AE H). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s friends testified telephonically. He has a Ph.D. in laboratory \nmedicine and pathology. He has known Applicant for more than 40 years. He is aware \nof Applicant\u2019s struggle with sciatica pain and fibromyalgia, and the issues surrounding \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe security clearance hearing. He has never observed Applicant abusing alcohol, \nalthough he has detected that Applicant had been consuming alcohol during an \noccasional telephone conversation over the past couple years. Applicant never \ndiscussed his work with him. The last time he saw Applicant was in December 2007. \n(Tr. 31-43). He considers him to be a good father, husband, friend, and dedicated \nemployee. \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s colleagues submitted letters in support of Applicant, \nattesting to his reliability, integrity and trustworthiness. One of them strongly \nrecommends his application for a Top-Secret security clearance. (AE B, D and E).  \n \n \nA clinical psychologist, who interviewed Applicant twice in January 2008, \ntestified. He has been licensed since 1986 and began working in private practice in \n1988. He has extensive clinical experience, covering a broad range of psychological \nissues. Over the course of his practice, he has performed many substance abuse \nevaluations for clients, including Applicant, who voluntarily came to him for a second \nopinion. As part of his evaluation, he administered two psychological assessment tests \nto Applicant: the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory Test and Michigan \nAlcohol Screening Tool. He also reviewed the July 2007 alcohol and drug assessment \nreport from the previous health care provider, and numerous documents written by \nApplicant in response to the Government\u2019s security concerns, as well as his medical \nrecords.  \n \n \nBased on his interview, the assessment tests and a review of various documents, \nthe psychologist concluded that Applicant possessed an \u201cAlcohol Abuse Disorder, In \nEarly Partial Remission and of mild to moderate severity.\u201d (AE A; Tr. 98). Applicant \nacknowledged that his alcohol consumption predisposed him to medical problems and \npotential employment issues. The psychologist recommended that Applicant abstain \nfrom all alcoholic beverages. In early March 2008, the psychologist again met with \nApplicant, who informed him that he had remained abstinent for two and a half months. \nThe psychologist opined that if the Applicant has abstained for that period of time, \u201che \nhas a good prognosis to be able to maintain sobriety without formal intervention or \ntreatment.\u201d (AE A at 2). He believes that \u201chistorically [Applicant\u2019s] use of alcohol has \nprimarily been social, and then in the last few years, his dinking increased as he started \nto use that as a treatment for his fibromyalgia.\u201d (Tr. 104). He does not have any \nreservations about Applicant\u2019s ability to perform his job competently or professionally. \n(Tr. 91-104).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. They have been married 30 years and have three adult \nchildren. For the last nine years, she has worked outside of the home. She is very \naware of her husband\u2019s physical problems and the various treatments and medications \nhe has used to treat them, including the consumption of alcohol. His consumption of \nbeer increased in the fall of 2006 when the sciatica pain became more prominent. She \ndoes not believe he has an alcohol problem and has observed him cease drinking for \nperiods of time. He generally never drank outside of the home. He has not consumed \nalcohol since December 2007. He currently manages his pain with physical therapy, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nexercise and vitamins. He may make an appointment at a pain clinic for additional \nassistance.  (Tr. 40-54). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \nBased on the evidence, the Government established a disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 22(d), which is applicable when there is evidence of \u201ca diagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d  On March 17, 2008, a clinical psychologist \ndiagnosed Applicant as having an Alcohol Abuse Disorder, in Early Partial Remission. \nAlthough the Government argued that the evidence also raised a disqualification under \nAG \u00b6 22(c) \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent,\u201d I do not agree.  Applicant and his wife deny that he became intoxicated to \nthe point of having impaired judgment while he drank at home at night. Furthermore, I \ndo not believe the Government intended that this disqualification be directed to \nindividuals who consume alcohol, alone, in the privacy of their home, and do not break \nany laws or violate established standards of conduct. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23 (a)-(d): \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \n\n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nApplicant credibly acknowledges his issues of alcohol abuse. Over the past nine \nmonths, he consumed about 12 drinks, and since December 7, 2008, he has not \nconsumed any alcohol. He has successfully addressed his pain problems through \nphysical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs. He is committed to abstinence and a \nhealthy life style. He has recently considered making an appointment at a pain \nmanagement clinic. All of those actions are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n23(b).  There is some evidence to support a limited application of AG \u00b6 23(c), in that he \nreceived a favorable prognosis from the evaluating clinical psychologist, based on his \npast months of sobriety. None of the other two mitigating conditions apply.   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 53-year-old man, who \nhas worked for his employer for more than 27 years and received exceptional ratings for \nseveral years. He has held a Secret security clearance for 26 years without any \nreported incidents of mishandling classified information. His current and former \nsupervisors consider him to be a very reliable, trustworthy and valued employee. They \nsupport his request for a Top-Secret security clearance, as do other colleagues.  Over \nthe past years, none of his witnesses observed Applicant to be intoxicated or exhibiting \nimpaired judgment, in spite of his painful condition.   \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant is an intelligent \nand successful individual, who imprudently began consuming alcohol at night as a \nmeans to manage excruciating pain. He has since learned to manage his pain through a \nchange in his life style and without alcohol. Given his commitment to change and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nabstinence, coupled with a lack of any other adverse evidence in his background, I do \nnot believe he poses a security risk. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under alcohol consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in of the SOR, with explanations. Applicant is 48 years old and has been an employee of a defense contractor since 1994. She has held a security clearance since 2006. She incurred debts to eight creditors that became delinquent for a total amount of over $17,000. These are alleged in the SOR and she confirmed them in her interrogatory (Exh. 3) and her answer to the SOR. The circumstances that led to her financial problems began with her divorce in 2002, and was compounded by a labor dispute in 2006 which resulted in no employment for seven months. She has considered using a credit counselor but has not done so (Tr. 43). Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are for a variety of credit cards two of which are to department stores. One for over $8,000 has been the subject of a garnishment on her salary since 2007. It is the only debt that is being paid. She did not report the delinquent debts at Question 28 on her SF 86 because she wanted to resolve the debts through re- financing her home to avoid reporting them to the government (Answer and Tr. 32). Applicant was unable to obtain refinancing at the time of the hearing although she provided documents showing that she was attempting to do so. Her home has a value of $140,000 and the remaining balance on the mortgage is $6,000. She was working through a bank and mortgage consultant (Exh. A) to obtain $75,000 through the re-financing.

Watson, Personal Representative \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 6, 2006.\nOn July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 20, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing through counsel on September 12, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on September 13,\n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 21, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on October 17, 2007, after another judge had been\nassigned the case on September 24, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nNovember 7, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 28, 2007.\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nThe government offered Exhibits (Exh.) 1 through 3, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 6,\n2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 2, 2008, to\nsubmit additional matters. No additional material was filed and Applicant failed to return\ncalls from Department Counsel who called to inquire if anything was to be sent. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in of the\nSOR, with explanations.\nApplicant is 48 years old and has been an employee of a defense contractor\nsince 1994. She has held a security clearance since 2006. She incurred debts to eight\ncreditors that became delinquent for a total amount of over $17,000. These are alleged\nin the SOR and she confirmed them in her interrogatory (Exh. 3) and her answer to the\nSOR.\nThe circumstances that led to her financial problems began with her divorce in\n2002, and was compounded by a labor dispute in 2006 which resulted in no\nemployment for seven months. She has considered using a credit counselor but has not\ndone so (Tr. 43). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are for a variety of credit cards two of which are to\ndepartment stores. One for over $8,000 has been the subject of a garnishment on her\nsalary since 2007. It is the only debt that is being paid. She did not report the delinquent\ndebts at Question 28 on her SF 86 because she wanted to resolve the debts through re-\nfinancing her home to avoid reporting them to the government (Answer and Tr. 32).\nApplicant was unable to obtain refinancing at the time of the hearing although\nshe provided documents showing that she was attempting to do so. Her home has a\nvalue of $140,000 and the remaining balance on the mortgage is $6,000. She was\nworking through a bank and mortgage consultant (Exh. A) to obtain $75,000 through the\nre-financing. Several of the creditors had agreed to settle for less than the debt if\npayment was made by November 30, 2007 (Exhs. A and B). \nApplicant did not supply any additional information about the refinancing during\nthe period of time the record was left open for her to do so. She did not return telephone\ncalls from the Department Counsel for two weeks thereafter in an effort to ascertain if\nany action had been taken. Thus, there is no evidence that the refinancing occurred or\nthat any debts have been paid. \nApplicant has a 15-year-old son for whom she is saving for his college education.\nShe receives $233 per month in child support. She earns over $2,000 per month with\n\n3\novertime working at an hourly rate of $20. Her mortgage payments are over $500 per\nmonth but if she re-finances they will rise to over $600. After deductions and mortgage\npayments, she has approximately $600 left at the end of the month (Tr. 35-38). She has\ncontributed to a 401k account through her employer and has approximately $14,000 in\nthe account. \nApplicant has a good reputation with her employer and has received several\nawards for her work. Her supervisor speaks highly of her work ethic and abilities. She is\nactive in her church and her priest speaks highly of her (Exh. C 1-6).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n4\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties have been extant for over five years and she acknowledges that little\nif anything has been done to resolve them (Tr. 50). \nUnder AG & 20(b), the concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted\nabove, some of the financial problems arose from divorce and a period of\nunemployment, but I cannot conclude that the concerns are mitigated. The lack of\neffective action by Applicant in the sequence of events since the debts were incurred,\n\n5\nbecame delinquent, the SF 86 was filed, and the hearing occurred are strong indicators\nof lack of appropriate action to resolve the security concerns.\nGuideline E Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nSuch conduct might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about and\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation (AG \u00b6 15).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire (AG \u00b6 16 a). Applicant\u2019s failure to report delinquent\ndebts at Question 28 of her SF 86, prompted security concerns under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct). There are mitigating conditions (MC) for this security concern, but\nnone of them are relevant to the facts of the case. \nApplicant acknowledged at several stages of this matter that she knew of the\ndelinquent debts and deliberately failed to report them on her SF 86 in the hope that she\ncould resolve the issues before the government discovered them. While she may have\nhad the intent to do so, she has never taken any action but preliminary steps to resolve\nthe financial problems even though she apparently had the financial means to make\nsome substantial progress to resolve them.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n6\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant has a solid record\nover 12 years of employment with her company, and is a worthwhile member of her\ncommunity, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance. While the debts may have, at least in some measure,\nbeen caused by events outside her control, her lack of substantial action to resolve the\nproblems over several years does not indicate responsible conduct. The issue is further\naggravated by her failure to report the delinquent debts on her SF 86 for no other\nreason that she wanted to get the debts resolved before the government learned of\nthem. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n_________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Matthew Rickman, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (e-QIP) on April 6, 2006.\nOn August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines G and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn October 1, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. On November 28, 2007, previously assigned\nDepartment Counsel indicated the government was prepared to proceed. The case was\nassigned to me on December 6, 2007, and on January 17, 2008, I scheduled a hearing\nfor February 27, 2008.\nApril 10, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing on February 27, 2008, as scheduled. Nine government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-9) and six Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-F) were admitted without any\nobjections, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 7,\n2008. For the reasons discussed below, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant is on\nprobation until May 2008 following his arrest for operating under the influence of alcohol\n(OUI) in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); was medically diagnosed in August 1991 as an alcohol\nabuser and/or alcohol dependent (SOR \u00b6 1.b); has since consumed alcohol through\nMay 2007 to excess with periods of abstinence (SOR \u00b6 1.c); received inpatient alcohol\ntreatment in spring 2004 at his employer\u2019s recommendation (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and received\nvoluntary alcohol treatment at the same facility in October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), twice in\n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), in September 2006, and in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) after relapsing.\nApplicant\u2019s arrest for OUI in May 2007 was also alleged under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted he turned to alcohol to cope with marital\nproblems which led to his inpatient treatment in August 1991, and that over the next 16\nyears he continued to battle problems with alcohol. He denied that the abuse was\ncontinuous over that time or that all his relapses were to excess, and averred that he\nmaintained long periods of sobriety. Applicant proffered in mitigation that he always\nacknowledged his problem, sought treatment, maintained a clearance for 35 years\nwithout any violations, and turned himself in to the police in May 2007 by parking at the\nstation and explaining he should not be driving. After consideration of the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old principal software engineer who has worked for his\nemployer, a defense contractor, since November 1995 (Ex. 1, Tr. 31). He seeks to\nretain the secret-level security clearance that he has held for about 35 years, excepting\na period of unemployment in 1994/95 (Ex. 1, Tr. 47).\nApplicant began drinking in about 1971 during his sophomore year in college (Ex.\n7). After he graduated in 1972, he worked as an electrical engineer for the U.S. Navy at\na naval avionics facility for over five years (Tr. 33-34). He held a secret-level clearance\nfor his duties (Answer, Ex. 1, Tr. 34). In 1974, he married his first wife, who was a\nmedical student studying to be a psychiatrist, and pursued his master\u2019s degree in\nelectrical engineering, which was awarded to him in May 1978. His use of alcohol did\nnot compromise his functioning during this time (Ex. 1, Ex. 7, Tr. 31-33).\nIn 1978, Applicant began working for a research laboratory developing algorithms\nand conducting evaluation studies of ballistic missile guidance systems (Answer, Tr. 35-\n37). He held a secret clearance for his duties (Tr. 37-38). He drank responsibly until\nabout 1985. Over the next five years, his consumption levels gradually increased and as\nof the late 1980s, his spouse began to urge him to seek treatment. Applicant saw a\n\n3\nphysician, but did not follow through with recommended alcohol treatment. By early\n1991, Applicant was drinking four beers plus a liter of wine daily, which did not help his\nalready troubled marriage (Ex. 5, Ex. 7). He drank to intoxication often on Saturday\nnights (Tr. 69).\nAfter his spouse suffered a miscarriage (Tr. 49), Applicant suffered depression\nthat led him to consult with the chief physician of a general hospital\u2019s clinical\npsychopharmacology unit in June 1991. Applicant was placed on an antidepressant and\nreferred to a physician specializing in substance abuse. As of his  substance abuse\nevaluation on August 1, 1991, Applicant had experienced blackouts, withdrawal\ntremors, problems abstaining, and drinking on occasion up to three liters of wine on a\nweekend day while sitting isolated in his room watching television (Ex. 7). Applicant\ndenies he reported to work intoxicated (Tr. 71), and the government presented no\nevidence to the contrary. Applicant was told unequivocally by the evaluating physician\nthat he needed inpatient alcohol treatment (Ex. 7, Tr. 72).\nHoping it would improve his relationship with his spouse (she gave him an\nultimatum), Applicant voluntarily admitted himself for inpatient psychiatric and alcohol\ntreatment in a mental health treatment facility (hospital X) on August 7, 1991 (Ex. 7, Tr.\n49-50). Applicant smelled of alcohol during his admission interview. Applicant was\nsuccessfully detoxified from alcohol and continued  on his antidepressant. At discharge\non August 23, 1991, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, condition much\nimproved, and with moderate depression by history, condition unchanged. Outpatient\ncare was recommended with some couples therapy (Ex. 7).\nApplicant continued in once weekly outpatient counseling for his substance\nabuse with a psychiatrist from August 1991 to September 1992, and then with a clinical\npsychologist at a different facility for the next two years. In addition, he was monitored\nby his physician pharmacologist every three to four months (Ex. 4). Applicant\nmaintained abstinence until April 1993 (Tr. 74). After he and his spouse separated in\nmid-April 1993, Applicant became active in a social organization involved in outdoor\nactivities. He began drinking a beer at club outings (Tr. 75). His work performance for\nJuly 1992 through June 1993 declined relative to his efficiency during the prior\nperformance period (Ex. 8). He was laid off from his long time employment effective July\n6, 1994. He was selected for layoff during a company downsizing because his work\nhabits had \u201csubstantially deteriorated\u201d and he could not be counted on to put in a full\nwork day. His attendance was rated as poor (Ex. 9). Applicant was depressed over the\nbreakup of his marriage (Tr. 82).\nSince he no longer had health insurance, Applicant switched his counseling from\nthe psychologist to a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) (Ex. 6, Tr. 52). From late\nAugust 1994 to at least June 1996, Applicant participated in weekly hour-long individual\ncounseling sessions with the LCSW to deal with diagnosed alcohol abuse, and issues\nsurrounding his depression, initial unemployment, his divorce from his first wife in June\n1995, and his social habits. Although he had been told by the LCSW on occasion that\nhe needed to stop drinking (Tr. 86), Applicant reported to the clinician that he had\n\nW hen asked to clarify the frequency of his drinking from January 1995 to July 1996, Applicant testified he\n1\ndrank occasionally, once a month, in social situations (Tr. 77).\n4\nconsumed at times a few beers, which added to his depression (Ex. 6). In July 1996,\nApplicant told a government investigator that he was abstinent from August 1991 to\nJune 1993, and consumed two drinks between July 1993 and December 1994 (Ex. 5).\nAt his hearing, he acknowledged that he could have been drinking \u201ca couple of beers a\nday\u201d following his job layoff (Tr. 83).\nIn January 1995, Applicant began drinking in a pattern of two or three beers\nalmost daily, with several periods of abstinence lasting for as little as one or two days up\nto a month at one point (Ex. 5).  In April 1995, after being unemployed since July 1994,\n1\nApplicant went to work as a contract employee for the research laboratory (Tr. 39). His\nsecret clearance was reinstated. In July 1995, Applicant\u2019s father died unexpectedly.\nApplicant became intoxicated following his father\u2019s funeral. He drank ten beers in an\neight-hour period (Ex. 5, Tr. 51, 76).\n In November 1995, Applicant started with his present employer. He continued to\ndrink at some of the outdoor club\u2019s events (Tr. 87). In application for a secret-level\nsecurity clearance for his new duties involving the upgrade of a missile system (Tr. 41),\nApplicant executed a National Agency Questionnaire (DD Form 398-2) on December 8,\n1995.  Applicant responded affirmatively to question 20.d concerning whether his use of\nalcoholic beverages had resulted in alcohol-related treatment or counseling. He\nindicated that marital problems and excessive drinking on the weekends led him to\ninpatient treatment for two weeks in August 1991 and that with the help of ongoing\ntherapy and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, the problem had not recurred\ndespite his divorce, unemployment, and the recent unexpected death of his father (Ex.\n4). Applicant was granted his secret-level clearance (Tr. 46-47).\nOn Christmas Day 1995, Applicant found himself alone after plans to get together\nwith a female friend fell through. He consumed ten beers to intoxication in his residence\n(Ex. 5, Tr. 76). Applicant was still under the care of the LCSW at the time (Ex. 5). On\nJuly 17, 1996, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about his alcohol\nconsumption. Applicant disclosed that his drinking increased from 1985 to 1991, when\nhis daily consumption of four beers and a liter of wine led him to seek treatment in 1991.\nWhile continuing with outpatient counseling and periodic AA meetings since his\ndischarge, he had been drinking since January 1995, \u201ctwo or three beers on an almost\ndaily basis\u201d with several periods of abstinence lasting one or two days or for a period of\nup to one month. He claimed to \u201chave done this self-inventory to confirm [he] was not\nhaving any problems with [his] use of intoxicants\u201d and that it was with the approval of his\ncounselor, an LCSW. Applicant expressed his intent to continue to using intoxicants at\nthat rate in the future. He attributed his increased usage to problems in his marriage.\nApplicant acknowledged he had consumed alcohol to intoxication on his father\u2019s death\nin July 1995, and on December 25, 1995 (Ex. 5).\n\n5\nIn 1998 or 1999, Applicant\u2019s employer moved the missile work Applicant was\nengaged in to a facility in another area of the country. Applicant was offered a year\u2019s\nsalary to relocate, but he instead chose to remain in his present locale. He transferred\nto another division within the company where his work has since focused on satellite\ncommunications systems for the U.S. military (Tr. 42-45). As of 2000, Applicant was\ndrinking \u201cmany days within a week,\u201d in greater quantity on the weekends. Applicant\nrecalls drinking to intoxication only once between 1995 and 2001, which was on a\nweekend in 2000 (Tr. 89). From 2001 to 2003, Applicant drank a couple of beers per\nnight (Tr. 90).\nIn June 2003, Applicant married his current spouse, whom he had met in 2001\nwhile singing in the choir at church (Tr. 54-55, 64, 91). She had four adult children (Ex.\n1, Tr. 64-65).  He had problems adjusting to his new marriage, and felt, as he had with\nhis first wife, that she was trying to control him (Tr. 55). Applicant started drinking more\non the weekends to avoid a relationship with her (Tr. 55). In 2004, his employer\nrecommended that he seek alcohol treatment due to a decline in his work productivity\n(Tr. 91-95). In August 2004, Applicant admitted himself to a five-day inpatient\ndetoxification program at hospital X. After he was discharged, he began attending\nweekly AA meetings and a recovery group meeting on Wednesdays at the hospital\n(Answer, Ex. 1, Tr. 96).\nAs of October 2004, Applicant was drinking about two to four glasses of wine per\nnight (Tr. 97). He returned to hospital X for a brief detoxification as an inpatient and then\noutpatient treatment (Answer, Tr. 98). On his discharge, Applicant began weekly private\ntreatment with a substance abuse counselor, an LICSW, who had facilitated the early\nrecovery group he attended at hospital X (Ex. E, Tr. 98). He also attended Wednesday\nnight group sessions with a psychologist (Tr. 98).\nApplicant relapsed after eight months of sobriety (Answer). On the advice of his\nsubstance abuse counselor, he readmitted himself for treatment to hospital X for a few\ndays in July 2005. He consumed a drink after his discharge, and returned to the hospital\nin September 2005 for a few more days of treatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence,\nas he wanted to prevent further abuse (Tr. 99). Applicant stopped drinking beer after\nthis admission (Ex. 2).\nIn renewal of his security clearance (Tr. 65), Applicant completed an e-QIP on\nApril 6, 2006. He responded affirmatively to question 25 concerning whether his use of\nalcohol had resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling in the last seven\nyears, and listed his treatment by physicians at hospital X\u2019s address in August 2004,\nOctober 2004, July 2005, and September 2005. In the additional comments section of\nthe e-QIP, Applicant added that he still owned the marital home he had shared with his\nfirst wife, that he attended AA meetings regularly, and that his father and two uncles\n(one killed) had fought in World War II ( Ex. 1).\nIn April 2006, Applicant underwent a medical procedure. Instead of taking his\nprescribed narcotic, he drank red wine in quantity sufficient for the pain to subside (Tr.\n99-100). In late September 2006, Applicant readmitted himself for several days of\n\nApplicant testified that he was drunk (\u201cI probably exceeded the legal limit\u201d) from the night before (Tr. 103-04).\n2\n6\ninpatient alcohol treatment to hospital X.  He was given a prescription medication,\nCampral, to decrease his craving for alcohol, but it was ineffective. Following his\ndischarge, Applicant began daily intensive outpatient group sessions, but he relapsed\nby drinking mouthwash containing alcohol in October 2006 (Answer, Tr. 100).\nDuring the first quarter of 2007, Applicant had difficulty dealing with his mother\u2019s\ndeteriorating medical condition that necessitated her transition into an assisted living\nsituation. Instead of calling his AA sponsor, who has over 35 years of sobriety (Ex. D,\nTr. 124), Applicant relapsed by drinking mouthwash and then red wine for a period of\nseveral weeks. He returned to hospital X in March 2007 for additional inpatient\ntreatment followed by outpatient group sessions (Answer, Ex. F, Tr. 100-01).\nApplicant remained abstinent until sometime in April 2007, when his mother\nagain experienced problems and he \u201cpicked up a drink again\u201d instead of calling his AA\nsponsor (Tr. 103). He drank one drink daily, initially mouthwash and then small bottles\nof red wine that he bought at the grocery store en route home from work (Tr. 120). He\ndid not consider calling his counselor before buying the wine as he was not ready to\naccept that he had to rely on the help of others (Tr. 121-22).\nDuring the weekend of May 5, 2007, Applicant and his spouse planned to visit\nher daughter living out of state. Informed by his spouse that he could not accompany\nher if he was going to drink any alcohol, Applicant decided to stay home as he was\nunwilling to commit to abstention (Tr. 102). He drank for four days. In the morning of\nMay 8, 2007, Applicant drove to the home he still owned from his previous marriage.2\nAfter he pulled in the driveway of the residence, Applicant realized he should not have\ndriven. Uncertain what to do and not wanting to enter the house because of the bad\nmemories associated with the house (Tr. 105), he tried to call his AA sponsor on his cell\nphone but was not successful. Applicant then drove the 1.2 miles to the police station to\nask for help (Tr. 56-57, 105-06). As the police approached, Applicant exited his vehicle\nand indicated, in slurred speech, that he should not be driving and that he was drunk.\nApplicant failed field sobriety tests and a breathalyzer administered to him at the station.\nAround 1045 hours, he was arrested for OUI with a blood alcohol content of .20%. At\nApplicant\u2019s request, he was then transported to the hospital. Around 1245 hours he was\nreleased back into the custody of the police. At about 1415 hours, he was transported\nby the police to the district court where further testing showed a 23% blood alcohol\nlevel. Determined to be too intoxicated to be arraigned, Applicant was placed in\nprotective custody and transported back to the police station (Ex. 3).\nApplicant appeared in court on May 22, 2007. He admitted to sufficient facts, and\nthe case was continued without a finding for one year on the condition that he\nsuccessfully complete his probation and pay fines and fees. Terms of probation\nincluded loss of license for 45 days, completion of a 16-week driver alcohol education\nprogram, and continued participation in AA three times per week as well as his\ncounseling with the substance abuse counselor he had been seeing since October 2004\n\n7\n(Ex. 3, Tr. 59). Two days after his court appearance (Ex. 2, Tr. 107), and again on June\n2, 2007, Applicant drank mouthwash containing alcohol (\u201cThere was a side of me that\nwas still not ready to quit. My wife was driving me around, I was determined to maintain\nmy right to drink. . . .\u201d Tr. 118). He did not contact his sponsor because he did not want\nto disappoint him (Tr. 125).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on June 4, 2007, that\nhe was not drinking any alcohol and did not intend to drink in the future; that he was still\nin counseling every Thursday night with the substance abuse counselor but was no\nlonger attending group therapy on Wednesdays at hospital X since he has been\nattending AA meetings and commitments on Wednesdays. His AA attendance over the\npast year had averaged four meetings weekly. He disclosed his recent OUI in May 2007\nand loss of license, which forced him to call AA members to get to meetings and\nresulted in closer relationships with other AA members. Applicant expressed his goal \u201cto\nnot take the first drink and remain abstinent no matter what happens.\u201d (Ex. 2).\nAs of February 27, 2008, Applicant had been abstinent from alcohol since he\ndrank the mouthwash on June 2, 2007 (Ex. F, Tr. 61), although he continued to\nexperience cravings for alcohol to at least late December 2007 (Tr. 126). He still attends\nweekly counseling sessions with his substance abuse counselor (Tr. 60-61), who\nbelieves he is sober and has \u201cfinally achieved some of the serenity that sobriety and AA\nhave offered.\u201d (Ex. E). Applicant also attends three AA meetings (speaker, home group,\nBig Book meetings) weekly (Tr. 122). Unlike in the past, he has taken a more active role\nin AA by speaking about his OUI on commitments (Tr. 123). Within the last several\nmonths, Applicant realized that he has to contact his sponsor even if he does not want\nto (Tr. 126). This sponsor considers him to be doing very well in the AA program (Ex.\nD). Applicant understands he is an alcoholic and that if he drinks the first drink, he will\neventually be unable to stop drinking (\u201cI\u2019ve proved that experiment many times,\nexpecting different outcomes.\u201d Tr. 62). Applicant\u2019s relationship with his spouse has\nimproved since June 2007 (Ex. C, Tr. 63). \nFollowing normal liver functioning tests in September 2007, Applicant\u2019s internist\nexpressed his clinical opinion that Applicant\u2019s \u201coutlook is dramatically more favorable\nthan it was earlier in our relationship.\u201d A recent examination of Applicant in February\n2008 confirmed for the physician that Applicant was completely sober (Ex. F).\nThe May 2007 OUI is the only transgression on Applicant\u2019s driving record (Ex. B,\nTr. 115-16). Applicant\u2019s work performance for 2004, 2005, and 2006 met his\nemployer\u2019s requirements. While tasks were behind schedule in 2005 due to Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to take more initiative to \u201cpin down the knowledgeable engineers,\u201d he was rated\nas a good software engineer (Ex. A). None of his annual reviews for 2004 through 2006\ncontain any unfavorable comments about Applicant\u2019s attendance or reliability.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n8\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set out\nin AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\n\n9\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and untrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant is a high-functioning alcoholic\nwho has battled his drinking problem since August 1991 when he admitted himself to a\nmental health/substance abuse treatment facility for the first time. After he was\ndischarged, he was abstinent for some 20 months, but despite ongoing counseling, was\nnot willing to acknowledge that he could not control his drinking or that he needed the\nhelp of others to remain sober. Over the next 14 years, he experienced several\nrelapses of varied duration, which he sought to minimize through additional treatment.\nPeriods of sobriety after treatment or while in active outpatient therapeutic relationships\nranged from days to months. His struggles to control his drinking eventually culminated\nin a May 2007 OUI committed about a year after he had obtained his sponsor in AA and\nmore than two years into his weekly individual counseling with his current therapist, a\ncertified substance abuse counselor. While doubtless the OUI had an impact on his\nbehavior, he relapsed twice after his arrest by drinking mouthwash containing alcohol.\nHis recent OUI offense raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d).\nMoreover, AG \u00b6 22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent\u201d) is implicated. He drank excessive amounts in at least 1991 (four\nbeers plus a liter of wine daily with up to three liters on some Saturdays), in July 1995\n(ten beers after his father\u2019s funeral), in December 1995 (ten beers while alone in his\nhome), and from May 5, 2007 to May 8, 2007, when his blood alcohol content tested at\n.20% at 1045 hours, which he claims was from drinking the night before. Furthermore,\nthe evidence shows he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent by the psychiatrist in\ncharge of hospital X\u2019s alcohol and drug treatment center in 1991, by medical\nprofessionals during at least his September 2005 readmission, and by the LCSW who\ncounseled him from August 1994 to at least June 1996. AG \u00b6 22(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist)\nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d) must be considered in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ncontinued suitability for access. Finally, given his repeated relapses following alcohol\ntreatment, including six separate admissions to hospital X since 2004, AG \u00b6 22(f)\n(\u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol\nrehabilitation program\u201d), applies.\nThe recency of Applicant\u2019s abusive drinking and his history of relapses preclude\nconsideration of mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 23(a), which applies to alcohol abuse\nsufficiently in the past, infrequent, or uncharacteristic \u201cthat it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\nor AG \u00b6 23(c) which applies only to current employees in counseling or treatment\nwithout a history of previous treatment and relapse. AG \u00b6 23(b) requires that \u201cthe\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d Applicant\nadmitted that even after the May 2007 OUI, he was determined to maintain his right to\n\n10\ndrink. He testified credibly to finally realizing that he is an alcoholic and that he cannot\nsafely take that first drink. His regular attendances at AA three times weekly,\ndemonstrated commitment to the AA program by speaking about his OUI, and\ncontinued weekly sessions with the substance abuse counselor, are just the latest in a\nlong history of actions taken to overcome his problem. Yet, the government contends\nthat Applicant\u2019s present abstinence of only about nine months is insufficient to\ndemonstrate the established pattern of abstinence also required under AG \u00b6 23(c)\nbecause of his alcoholism. The quality of Applicant\u2019s commitment to recovery during his\nlatest abstention is a relevant factor in determining whether his present abstinence\nprovides adequate guarantees against further relapses. There is credible evidence from\nothers who know Applicant well (his spouse, counselor, and AA sponsor) confirming\nthat Applicant is genuinely committed to his recovery. However, the evidence also\nshows it has only been in the last several months that Applicant has gone on AA\ncommitments and realized that he has to call his sponsor even when he does not want\nto. Given Applicant\u2019s history of repeated relapses as well as the seriousness of his\nrelapses, it would be premature for me to conclude at this juncture that he has\nestablished a sufficient pattern of abstinence. The magnitude of Applicant\u2019s drinking\nproblem is shown by his choice of alcohol over his prescription medication in April 2006,\nand by his May 2007 OUI. He was very intoxicated when he drove from the home he\nshares with his spouse to his old residence in another town, as evidenced by a blood\nalcohol content reported to be 23% at 1415 hours, some 3.5 hours after his arrest.\nWhen asked at his hearing whether he was drunk when he drove his car to his old\nhome, Applicant responded, \u201cI probably exceeded the legal limit.\u201d (Tr. 104). His severe\nintoxication was definite, not just probable.\nApplicant stands in a similar situation with respect to satisfying some but not all\nof the requirements of mitigating condition \u00b6 23(d) (\u201cthe individual has successfully\ncompleted inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required\naftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in\nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d). Applicant is\ncredited with seeking treatment and complying with his various programs. But the\nsuccess of his treatment efforts is debatable when judged in terms of Applicant\u2019s insight\ninto his alcohol problem, and willingness to commit himself to what is required to bring\nabout sustained abstinence. Despite several admissions to hospital X since October\n2004, and ongoing substance abuse counseling, Applicant did not think of calling his\nsubstance abuse counselor before he stopped at the store to buy red wine in April 2007.\nNor did he contact his AA sponsor before he drank the mouthwash in June 2007\nbecause he did not want to disappoint him.\nWhile it took an OUI offense for Applicant to reconsider his attitude toward\ndrinking, recent assessments of his prognosis are favorable. His counselor believes him\nto be sober and to have \u201cfinally achieved some of the serenity\u201d offered by sobriety and\nAA. She also confirms he is \u201clearning\u201d to ask for help when needed, that he looks\nforward to his AA meetings, and is \u201cstarting\u201d to be able to give back to the program (Ex.\n\n11\nE). Although not a clear statement of his prognosis, they are clearly favorable indicators\nof progress. Following normal liver functioning tests in September 2007, Applicant\u2019s\ninternist expressed his clinical opinion that Applicant\u2019s \u201coutlook is dramatically more\nfavorable than it was earlier in our relationship.\u201d (Ex. F). A recent examination of\nApplicant in February 2008 confirmed his sobriety. Despite the favorable prognosis, for\nthe reasons noted above, Applicant has not yet demonstrated the clear and established\npattern of abstinence required to overcome the very serious alcohol consumption\nconcerns.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG\n\u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s May 2007 OUI is recent criminal\nconduct that implicates AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d).\nAlthough adjudication was withheld for one year, the evidence proves he was drunk\nwhen he drove his vehicle from one town to another and then from his home to the\npolice station in May 2007. AG \u00b6 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d)\nalso applies because Applicant is on probation for the OUI until May 21, 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s OUI is isolated, and uncharacteristic of his drinking habits. Although\nhe consumed alcohol in the past at gatherings of members of the outdoor club, he\ndrank to excessive levels primarily if not solely at home, usually on the weekends when\nhe shut himself off from others. However, Applicant\u2019s OUI is too recent and reflects such\npoor judgment to favorably consider AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\u201d). Applicant\u2019s record of good work performance with his current\nemployer and his remorse about the OUI are evidence of rehabilitation that can be\nconsidered under AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement\u201d), but Applicant is still on probation for his criminal conduct. As\nthe DOHA Appeal Board held in ISCR 05-07893 (App. Bd. Oct. 1, 2007), current\nprobationary status is not a per se bar to a favorable clearance decision. However, it\nsignificantly undercuts a finding of successful rehabilitation. As long as a risk of future\nabusive drinking persists, another alcohol-related incident cannot be ruled out.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held a security\nclearance without any violations for about 35 years. Work gave him structure and\nsomething to focus on other than the problems that were leading him to drink at home,\nbut alcohol also affected his productivity at times. In October 2004, his supervisor\nadvised him to seek treatment. While relapses to some extent can be expected,\nApplicant put his desire to control his own choices ahead of his personal relationship\nwith his spouse in May 2007 and even ahead of his fiduciary obligation to the\n\nTreatment completed is viewed favorably. Adverse findings are nonetheless returned as to \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d., 1.e,\n3\n1.f, and 1.g. because of his relapses after treatment.\n12\ngovernment. As a longtime cleared employee, Applicant knew or should have known\nthat protecting classified information is a 24-hour-per-day responsibility that extends\nbeyond the workplace, and drinking to intoxication is incompatible with that duty. At this\ntime, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue his clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant3\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nE. Shane Hollaway, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 16, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\n\nGovernment Exhibit 2 includes a summary of Applicant\u2019s Personal Subject Interview, Dec. 11, 2006.  \n1\nAccording to this document, at the time of the 2005 incident, Applicant was the president of a local community center.\nHe had obtained the assistance of work-release inmates for work at the center.  During the trip back to the county jail\nat the end of the day, one of the inmates requested that Applicant drive by the inmate\u2019s house to obtain some headache\nmedicine.  Applicant drove to the specified address and the inmate went to the house.  Applicant stated that, while parked\nthere, he realized that the house was actually an abandoned one.  Neighbors observed the activity and alerted the police,\nwho stopped Applicant\u2019s vehicle. \n2\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 26, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing to conclude\nthat Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was arrested, charged,\nand convicted of drug related offenses.  The first, in 1988, arose when he was stopped by police at\na drunk-driving checkpoint.  When Applicant admitted to the police that he had been drinking, they\nsearched his car and found a marijuana cigarette butt in the ashtray.  The second, in 2005, occurred\nwhen Applicant was transporting county inmates back to jail after they had worked at a local\ncommunity center on a work release program.  Police stopped them and, upon searching Applicant\u2019s\ncar, discovered drug use paraphernalia.   In the Analysis section of the decision, the Judge reported\n1\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for these incidents.  Applicant stated that, in both cases, the contraband was\nnot his, but had been placed in his car by another person.  \nIn analyzing the case, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s explanations were not credible.  \u201cIt\nis simply too difficult to believe that Applicant, a security clearance holder since about 1983, had\nsuch bad luck, not once, but twice . . . [I]t is highly improbable that Applicant could be the victim\nof accidental circumstances on two occasions that resulted in drug-related charges and convictions.\u201d\n Decision at 5.   \nThe Board has considered Applicant\u2019s brief, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the record.  The Judge\nproperly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under Guidelines H and J.\nFurthermore, the Judge drew a \u201crational connection between the facts found\u201d and his conclusion that\nneither the Guidelines H and J mitigating conditions nor the whole-person factors support a decision\nfavorable to Applicant.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto.\nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision reflects that he considered the entire record, including the\nevidence favorable to Applicant.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\ncompel a favorable overall security clearance decision.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 05-03452 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul 3, 2007).  The record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has failed to meet\n\n3\nhis burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for\nhim to have a clearance.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 16, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline H for drug involvement and Guideline J for criminal\nconduct based on two drug-related offenses. \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on November 2, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled on January 31, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on February 11, 2008.\nThe record was left open until February 8, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit an additional documentary exhibit. It was timely submitted and department\ncounsel had no objections to it. The post-hearing matter is marked and admitted as\nExhibit F\u2013Affidavit of Applicant. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant was arrested, charged, and\nconvicted of drug-related offenses in 2005 and 1988. Under Guideline J, the SOR\nrepeats the two drug-related offenses and adds a driving while intoxicated (DWI)\noffense to the 1988 incident. In his Answer, Applicant admits all the factual allegations.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He works as a\nphoto support technician. He has worked for his current employer since November\n2002. He has worked in the same field at the same general location since about 1982.\nHe has held a security clearance as an employee of a federal contractor since about\n1983. \nTo retain a security clearance, Applicant completed a security-clearance\napplication in February 2006. In response to the relevant question about alcohol- or\ndrug-related offenses, Applicant disclosed the 1988 and 2005 incidents that form the\nbasis for the SOR allegations. In response to a question about drug use, Applicant\ndenied any illegal use of a controlled substance within the relevant periods. \nConcerning the 1988 incident, Applicant admits that he was arrested, charged,\nand convicted of the misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana; he was also\nconvicted of DWI. This incident arose when Applicant and his cousin were stopped by\npolice at a drunk-driving checkpoint (Tr. 86\u201390). Applicant admitted to the police that he\nhad been drinking. When the police searched his car, they found a roach (a marijuana\nbutt) in the ashtray located between the front seats of Applicant\u2019s car, which he was\ndriving. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n3\nConcerning the 2005 incident, Applicant admits that he was arrested, charged,\nand convicted of the misdemeanor offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. This\nincident arose when Applicant and a group of county jail inmates on a work-release\nprogram were stopped by police (Tr. 90\u201398; Exhibits 2, 3). Applicant was transporting\nthe inmates to the county jail after they worked at a local community center. When the\npolice searched Applicant, they found a box used to smoke marijuana. \nWith the assistance of counsel, Applicant entered a plea agreement wherein he\npleaded guilty to the paraphernalia offense (Exhibit 4). The state court imposed a\nsentence that included: (1) a fine of $500 plus court costs of $310; (2) 180 days in the\ncounty jail, all of which was suspended: (3) probation for 24 months until about April 20,\n2007; and (4) completion of a court-referral program. The court records indicate that\nApplicant\u2019s guilty plea was a \u201cbest interest plea\u201d (Exhibit 4). He completed all court-\nreferral program requirements in December 2005 (Exhibit 4 at 3; Exhibit B). He\ncompleted his probation without a violation.    \nApplicant has taken and passed random drug tests for his employment (Exhibits\nA, C, and D). He passed a drug screen in May 2002 as well as a pre-employment drug\nscreen in November 2002. He recently passed a random drug screen in July 2007. \nIn his post-hearing affidavit, Applicant gave his consent for the Defense\nDepartment to revoke any security clearance that he may hold if in the future he\nreceives any alcohol- or drug-related charges or fails any drug tests that he might be\nrequired to take through his employer (Exhibit F). Also, he consented to not oppose a\nrevocation of the security clearance and waive any rights to a hearing.  \nConcerning his job performance, Applicant is a knowledgeable photographer who\nproduces work that is both high in quality and quantity (Exhibit E). The site supervisor\nfor the company describes Applicant as a professional and reliable employee. A\ngovernment employee who has worked with Applicant for 20 years also has praise for\nApplicant\u2019s work abilities. In addition, he has seen nothing to suggest that Applicant has\na problem with alcohol or drugs. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 17-18 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n17\n5\nAnalysis\nThe two security guidelines will be discussed together because the SOR\nallegations are factually related or connected to each other. Under Guideline H for drug\ninvolvement,  the concern is that the \u201cuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\n14\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  Under Guideline J for\n15\ncriminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\n16\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  \n17\nBefore addressing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the security\nguidelines, it is necessary to decide a key factual dispute, which is Applicant\u2019s culpability\nor guilt for the two drug-related offenses. Applicant maintains his innocence in this\nproceeding notwithstanding his convictions in state court. If his explanations are\naccepted as genuine and true, all that remains is a 20-year-old DWI conviction. If his\nexplanations are viewed as dubious or incredible, the security concerns are self-evident.\nFor the 1988 incident, Applicant contends that he did not know that the marijuana\nbutt was in his car. He believes that his cousin or another man or both put it in the\nashtray when they borrowed his car earlier in the evening. \nFor the 2005 incident, Applicant contends that he did not possess the\nparaphernalia with the intent to use it, which is an element of the offense (Exhibit 4 at\n6). Instead, he offered an explanation\u2014supported by his son\u2019s testimony\u2014that the item\nbelonged to his son who left it in the truck the previous night. When stopped by the\npolice, Applicant saw the item, knew it didn\u2019t belong in his truck, and put it in his pocket\nwhere it was found by the police. This is similar to the explanation he gave the police at\nthe scene when he said he did not know what the box was and disclaimed ownership of\nit (Exhibit 3 at 4). \nApplicant\u2019s innocent explanations for the two drug-related incidents, although not\ncompletely far-fetched, are dubious and not credible. It is simply too difficult to believe\nthat Applicant, a security-clearance holder since about 1983, had such bad luck, not\nonce, but twice. Although the 1988 and 2005 incidents are separated in time and are\nnot identical, it is highly improbable that Applicant could be the victim of accidental\ncircumstances on two occasions that resulted in drug-related charges and convictions.\nIn reaching this conclusion, consideration was given to testimony of Applicant\u2019s son who\n\n DC 3 is \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\n18\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n19\n DC 3 is \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\n20\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n6\ntook the blame for the drug paraphernalia in the 2005 incident. The son\u2019s testimony was\ndiscounted, however, due to his bias for his father and his own legal troubles (Tr.\n78\u201381).\nTurning to the disqualifying conditions, DC 3  of Guideline H applies against\n18\nApplicant based on the two possession offenses. Under Guideline J for criminal\nconduct, both DC 1  and DC 3  apply based on 1988 and 2005 arrests, charges, and\n19\n20\nconvictions. The totality of the disqualifying information calls into question Applicant\u2019s\njudgment as well as his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under both guidelines have been considered and\nnone apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant\u2019s dubious and incredible hearing testimony\nmilitates against any credit in mitigation.  \nTo conclude, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\nand unfavorable, and the record evidence raises doubt about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b\n \nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n2\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\n \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give adequate weight to the mitigating evidence.  In support of his requests, Applicant\nsummarizes the favorable evidence he presented below and describes his ongoing efforts to resolve\nhis financial problems.   Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \n2\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had substantial delinquent debts.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nwere still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge\nweighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors.  He found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E and as to several of the\nfactual allegations under Guideline F.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s  security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 36 years old and has worked as a technician for a defense contractor for over a year. He left the Navy in 2006 after serving on active duty as an operations specialist and master at arms for over 16 years. He was administratively separated with a general discharge under honorable conditions for a pattern of misconduct. Applicant is a high school graduate and has taken some college level courses. He married another active duty Navy sailor, who is now a senior chief (E-8), in 1990. They have three children. They separated about two years ago and are in the process of divorcing. One of the children lives with Applicant and the other two with his wife. Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty. (Tr. 21-22; Gov. Ex. 1, security clearance application, dated December 9, 2005) Applicant and his wife had financial and marital problems. When they separated, he moved board a ship and sent her all of his pay except $400 per month. He believed his wife was taking care of the family finances. Applicant deployed with his ship, and on return learned that his wife had not been making mortgage payments.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 9, \n2005. On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct under Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nNovember 29, 2007. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 8, 2008.  He admitted seven \nand denied one of the financial considerations allegations with explanation.  He denied \nthe allegation under Guideline E that he falsified information on his security clearance \napplication.  He admitted the allegation under Guideline E that he received a General \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ndischarge (Under Honorable Conditions) from the Navy due to a pattern of misconduct.  \nHe requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on January 31, 2008.  The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on February 1, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 13, 2008.  \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 19, 2008, for a hearing on April 30, 2008.  I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered 14 exhibits, marked \ngovernment exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 14, which were received without objection.  \nApplicant testified on his own behalf.  Applicant did not submit any exhibits but the \nrecord was kept open for him to submit documentation.  Applicant timely submitted \nseven documents, marked App. Ex. A-G, which were admitted to the record without \nobjection from Department Counsel. (Gov. Ex. 15, Letter, dated May 27, 2008)  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008.  Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of MILPERSMAN \n1910-140, admitted as Court Exhibit I, which governs separation of Navy members for a \npattern of misconduct.  I have taken administrative notice of the Navy regulation, which \nnotes that two non-judicial punishments administered during a current enlistment are \nconsidered a pattern of misconduct. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 36 years old and has worked as a technician for a defense contractor \nfor over a year.  He left the Navy in 2006 after serving on active duty as an operations \nspecialist and master at arms for over 16 years.  He was administratively separated with \na general discharge under honorable conditions for a pattern of misconduct.  Applicant \nis a high school graduate and has taken some college level courses.  He married \nanother active duty Navy sailor, who is now a senior chief (E-8), in 1990.  They have \nthree children.  They separated about two years ago and are in the process of divorcing.  \nOne of the children lives with Applicant and the other two with his wife.  Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance while on active duty. (Tr. 21-22; Gov. Ex. 1, security clearance \napplication, dated December 9, 2005)   \n \nApplicant and his wife had financial and marital problems.  When they separated, \nhe moved board a ship and sent her all of his pay except $400 per month.  He believed \nhis wife was taking care of the family finances.  Applicant deployed with his ship, and on \nreturn learned that his wife had not been making mortgage payments.  Applicant was \nadvised to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and bring their mortgage payments current.  \nApplicant and his wife consulted an attorney and they filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on \nJanuary 4, 1999, as alleged in SOR 1.a.  There was a paperwork problem created by \ntheir attorney so the petition was dismissed and resubmitted on March 24, 1999.  After \nmaking a few monthly payments and bringing their mortgage current, on the advice of \ntheir bankruptcy attorney, Applicant and his wife converted the Chapter 13 to a Chapter \n\n \n3 \n \n \n7 bankruptcy on June 23, 2003.  Their debts were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy \non October 23, 2003.  (SOR allegation 1.b; Tr. 23-26, 52-53; Gov. Ex. 3, bankruptcy \ndocuments, dated March 2, 1999; Gov. Ex. 4, bankruptcy documents, dated October \n23, 2003) \n \nAdditional delinquent debts accumulated after Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged \nin bankruptcy.  The SOR lists six delinquent debts totaling $18,715.  These debts \ninclude a charged off account to Capital One for $1,174 (1.c); a charged off account for \nWashington Mutual/Providian for $2,232 (1.d); another charged off Capital One account \nfor $1,074 (1.e); a judgment from Freedom Acceptance for $3,594 (1.f); a collection \naccount to the Department of Defense for $10,192 (1.g); and a collection account to \nZenith Acquisition for a credit card account of $450 (1.h). (See, Gov. Ex. 5, credit report, \ndated December 28, 2005; Gov. Ex. 7, credit report, dated May 7, 2007; Gov. Ex. 9, \ncredit report, dated July 24, 2007; Gov. Ex. 11, credit report, dated October 11, 2007; \nand Gov. Ex. 12, credit report, dated April 23, 2008)  Applicant admitted all of the debts \nwith explanation except the Zenith Acquisition debt in allegation 1.h, which he had no \nknowledge.   \n \nApplicant sought financial counseling but learned his debt load was such that \ndebt consolidation would not assist him.  He is now current with his mortgage and car \npayments.  He and his wife are attempting to sell the home they own together.  He \nhopes to pay his remaining debts with his share of the equity in the house, which is \ncalculated at a total of $97,000.  Since separating from his wife, one of their children \nlives with Applicant and the other two with his wife.  Applicant\u2019s monthly income from \nsalary and Veteran\u2019s Administration disability is $4,212.  His monthly expenses are \napproximately $2,075 with a discretionary fund remainder of $2,137. (Tr. 41-50) \n \nThe first Capital One account, SOR allegation 1.c, is for a credit card account \ncharged off for $1,173, and was included in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. (Tr. \n26-28)  The second Capital One account, SOR allegation 1.e, is also for a credit card \naccount and is listed as charged off and also the subject of a judgment for $910.39. \n(Gov. Ex. 14, Judgment, dated September 14, 2007)  Applicant has discussed the \njudgment with the creditor and is attempting to reach a settlement.  (Tr. 28-29, 53-55; \nApp. Ex. A, Letter, dated May 9, 2008) \n \nThe Washington Mutual/Providian account, SOR allegation 1.d, is for a credit \ncard and is charged off for $2,232.  Applicant has written the creditor to settle the \naccount but has not heard from them.  (Tr. 31-32) \n \nThe Freedom Acceptance account, SOR allegation 1.f, was for computer and \nstereo equipment.  Applicant has been making payments on the account and it is \ncurrent with a balance of about $1,737. (Tr. 29-31, 55-57; App. Ex. D, Account \nstatement, dated May 20, 2008; Gov. Ex. 13, Judgment, dated February 27, 2007)  \n \nThe debt to the Department of Defense for $10,192, SOR allegation 1.g, was for \nthe balance of a re-enlistment bonus received by Applicant which he is required to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrepay because he did not complete the terms of the re-enlistment.  Applicant received \n$30,000 for a three year re-enlistment.  He only served two years of the enlistment \nbefore being released from active duty.  He is required to repay the portion of the re-\nenlistment bonus for the time not served.  Applicant has contacted the collection agency \nfor the creditor and is attempting to reach a payment agreement.  (Tr. 32-35, 57-58; \nApp. Ex. B, Letter, date May 9, 2008) \n \nThe Zenith Acquisition account, SOR allegation 1.h, was for a credit card.  \nApplicant at first did have knowledge of the debt.  After further inquiry, he acknowledged \nthe debt and is making arrangement to make payments. Applicant has renewed his \nefforts to pay this account and requested an agreement to make payments.  (Tr. 35-36, \n58-59; App. Ex. E, Account notice, dated august 18, 2006; App. Ex. G, e-mail, dated \nMay 23, 2008; App. Ex. E, account statement, dated August 18, 2006) \n \nApplicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 26 on his security clearance application \nwhich asked in the last seven years had he ever been arrested, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offense(s).  Records show that in November 2004, while on active \nduty, Applicant was arrested and charged by civilian authorities with assault and battery. \n(Government Exhibit 6, Federal Bureau of Investigation report, dated December 29, \n2005)  Applicant was in an altercation with another person at a party.  Police were \ncalled but Applicant departed the party before they arrived.  He later learned that \ncharges were filed.  He was required to go to court but all charges were dismissed.  \nApplicant did not list the offense on his security clearance application because he \nbelieved he was not required to do so since the charges were dismissed.  When \nquestioned about the offense by security investigators, he told them about the charge \nand explained he did not think it was required to be reported on the security clearance \napplication since it was dismissed. (Tr. 50-52, 62-63)  \n \nApplicant was administratively separated with a General Discharge under \nHonorable Conditions from the Navy after over 16 years of active duty.  He had \nreceived two non-judicial punishments during his most recent enlistment. (See, Court \nExhibit I)  Applicant received a traffic ticket and was required to go to court.  He thought \nhis absence from his duty station was approved by his chief through his leading petty \nofficer.  His absence was not approved and he received non-judicial punishment.  \nApplicant believes his wife\u2019s fellow chief petty officers were working to cause him \nproblems at his wife\u2019s request.  Applicant was having marital problems and he wanted \nto be discharged from the Navy and received a second non-judicial punishment. (Tr. 20-\n21)  Applicant is attempting to have the discharge upgraded to Honorable Discharge. \n(Tr. 60-61; App. Ex. F, Application for review of discharge, undated) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations),  \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts because of an inability to pay his financial \nobligations.  The bankruptcy discharges are not a security concern since bankruptcy is \na legal and permissible means of resolving debts.  His debts at the time were resolved \nthrough the process.  However, the facts causing the bankruptcy and the financial \nactions taken after bankruptcy discharge should be examined to determine financial \nresponsibility and the impact on security worthiness.   \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Some of the delinquent debts have \nonly recently been addressed by Applicant.  These debts are still not paid so they are \ncurrent debts.  There are a number of delinquent debts from various sources such as \ncredit cards and a pay advance.  Since they are current debts that have not been paid, \nthey cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) has some application to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation.  Applicant had financial problems after he and his wife had marital problems, \nand she did not pay their bills as required.  Applicant initially failed to take responsible \naction on the delinquent debts, even though he is now trying to act responsibly towards \nthe debts.  Of the six debts listed in credit reports, one was discharged in the \nbankruptcy, and one is being paid and the account is current.  He recently contacted the \nother creditors.  He has not heard from one creditor.  He has been trying to make \narrangements with the three other creditors, including the creditor for the largest debt.  \nHe has not yet made any arrangements and has not started to make any payments on \nthese debts.  He has not established responsible action towards his debts under the \ncircumstances, so the mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  Applicant attempted to seek financial counseling, but \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndetermined that it would not be assistance to him.  This mitigating condition does not \napply since he has not received any formal financial counseling.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not application for Applicant.  For FC \nMC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, \nand \u201cevidence\u201d of a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling debts is needed.  The debts arose because of the marital problems with his \nwife, his discharge from the Navy, and his wife\u2019s failure to pay all of their debts while he \nwas deployed.  Applicant initially failed to make payment arrangements on all of his \ndebts because some he was not aware of and the others he simply neglected.  \nApplicant\u2019s action on most of the debts has been to contact creditors to seek \narrangements to pay the debts.  Applicant presented no information to show he has a \nplan to pay the debts or any action taken to make payments.  He has not been able to \ncomplete arrangements with creditors for payment plans.  An applicant is not required to \nbe debt free, but is required to act responsibly in regard to his finances.  A promise to \nmake arrangements or make future payments is not sufficient to indicate a good-faith \neffort to pay debts or an indication of acting responsibly towards the debts.  Applicant \nhas not presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for financial \nconsiderations. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance process depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answer to a \nquestion concerning an arrest for assault and battery charge on his security clearance \napplication raises security concerns under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \n(PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations determine security eligibility or trustworthiness).   \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He believed he did not have to list his \narrest for assault and battery. Since the case was dismissed, he did not consider it an \noffense.  While there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification \nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when \napplying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement \n\n \n8 \n \n \nis not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it \nis done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant knew of arrest but since the charge was \ndismissed he believed it was not required to be listed.  While the question on the \nsecurity clearance application is clear, a reader not schooled in legal matters could \nreasonably believe a dismissed offense is not considered as having happened.  \nApplicant belief is reasonable and shows he did not deliberately fail to provide the \ncorrect information with the intent to deceive.   \n \n \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Navy for a pattern of misconduct \nraises a security concern under PC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, . . .).  In regard to this \nissue, I considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and PC MC \u00b6 \n19(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur); and PC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps \nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress).  Applicant\u2019s \ndischarge was precipitated by his marital problems which caused the pattern of \nmisconduct.  He was willing to accept the discharge after many years of service just to \nbe out of the Navy and the influence his wife had on his career through other chief petty \nofficers.  His actions could indicate he acted irresponsibly towards his career thus \nindicating he would act irresponsibly towards protecting classified information.  \nHowever, his actions were caused more by marital issues than irresponsible conduct.  \nAdditionally, an administrative discharge for a pattern of misconduct could be a means \nof exploitation, manipulation or duress.  Applicant\u2019s discharge was a one time event and \nhappened under the unusual circumstances of marital problems.  It is not likely to recur.  \nHe took responsibility and positive steps by applying to have his discharge upgraded.  \nHe is not under stress for the discharge and it does not affect his trustworthiness or \nreliability.  I find for Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \n\n \n9 \n \n \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant\u2019s over 16 \nyears of active duty in the Navy during which he successfully held a security clearance.  \nHe is taking positive steps to upgrade his discharge. I considered that his problems \nwere precipitated by marital issues.  I considered that he has delinquent debt that he is \njust by contacting creditors to make payment arrangements.  He has not completed the \narrangements or made any payments.  He has the financial means to repay his debts \nwith his creditors, but he is only now starting the process of payment.  Applicant is now \nattempting to resolve his financial issues, and has the ability to enter a plan to pay his \ndelinquent debts.  If he establishes adequate arrangements with creditors and makes \npayments according to the plans, he may in the future be able to establish responsibly \nfinancial behavior. \n \nOn balance, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For the reasons stated, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  He has mitigated security concerns for personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn April 25, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On August 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 28, 2007. On September \n7, 2007, he answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. On October 18, 2007, Department Counsel prepared \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \na File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven Items, and mailed Applicant a \ncomplete copy on October 23, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on October 29, \n2007, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. On November 8, 2007, Applicant submitted a letter that I marked Applicant \nExhibit (AE 1) and admitted into the record without objection from Department Counsel.  \nOn December 21, 2007, I received the case assignment. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old and single. In May 2001, he graduated from a \nprestigious university with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. In September 2001, he \nbegan working as a software engineer for his current employer, a federal contractor. In \nApril 2006, he submitted an SF 86. (Item 4). \n \n \nIn December 2006, a government investigator interviewed Applicant regarding \ndisclosures he made in the SF 86 about his drug use. Applicant admitted that he used: \nmarijuana at least twenty times from November 2000 to August 2003; ecstasy two to \nthree times from February 2001 to December2002; mushrooms twice from April 2001 to \nFebruary 2006; LSD two to three times from August 2001 to December 2004; cocaine \nabout twenty-five to thirty-five times from about May 2002 to December 2003; and \nmethamphetamine at least three times from June 2003 to October 2003, at home, and \nonce in 2006 while traveling in a foreign country to visit a friend. (Item 5; AE 1). \n \n \nDuring the interview, Applicant stated that he \u201cwas probably dependent on \n[cocaine] but he isn\u2019t now.\u201d  (Id. at 3). He has no intention of using drugs in the future. \nHe did not receive any substance abuse counseling or engage in rehabilitative \nmeasures. (Id. at 4). In his letter of November 8, 2007, Applicant included a signed \nstatement of his intention not to use drugs again, with the caveat that if he violated his \npledge, his security clearance would be revoked immediately. (AE 1 at 4).  \n \n \nApplicant also noted in his recent letter that he purchased a house in April 2003, \npaid off his student loans ahead of schedule, has no criminal record, maintained his job \nwith above average performance ratings, and voluntarily disclosed his substance abuse \nin the SF 86 and to his family, friends and employer. He no longer associates with those \nfriends with whom he used drugs. He also stopped drinking alcohol entirely.  (Id. at 1 \nand 2).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n3 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: (1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified \nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and; (2) inhalants and other similar substances; (b) drug \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions that he used illegal drugs from approximately \n2000 until December 2006, the Government raised a potentially disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition).\u201d \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation.  I \nconsidered two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that may be potentially applicable \nto the disqualifying condition:  \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand, \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n25(a) does not apply. Applicant used illegal drugs from 2000 until December 2006. His \nusage was frequent and occurred with his friends, the last incident being about a year \n\n \n5 \n \n \nago while traveling out of the country. Given his six-year history of significant drug use, \nan asserted year of abstinence is insufficient to trigger application of this condition. His \npast behaviors do cast doubt on his trustworthiness and good judgment.   \nApplicant stated he no longer associates with his friends that use drugs. He also \nsigned a statement that he would agree to an automatic revocation of his clearance \nshould it be determined that he used drugs in the future. Those facts warrant the limited \napplication of AG \u00b6 26 (b) \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d \nas noted by his (1) \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d and (4) \u201ca \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d  \nWithout independent evidence to corroborate his dissociation from former friends or an \nestablished system to monitor his decision not to use drugs (if given a clearance), full \napplication of this condition is not warranted.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 28-year-old man, who \nbegan using drugs frequently in college and continued using them past graduation, \nincluding while employed with his current employer, a federal contractor, and seemingly \nafter he completed his SF 86.  While I find his articulated accomplishments over the \npast couple years commendable, along with his honesty and statements that he does \nnot intend to use drugs in the future helpful, I am not convinced that he mitigated his six-\nyear history of drug abuse. Without independent corroboration from an appropriately \ncredentialed health care provider and/or other sources, documenting Applicant\u2019s \nassertions that he is drug free, I am concerned there is a strong likelihood that he will \nuse drugs in the future. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nFebruary 11, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 27, 2005\n(Government Exhibit 1). On July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed security\nconcerns under Guidelines C and B stating why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 19, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 29, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\n\n2\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 18, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on September 20, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on October 4, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 19,\n2007. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called three additional\nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I through N, without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing, and the record closed, on October 29, 2007.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Republic of India. (Transcript at 12-15.) The request and\nthe attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the\nrecord as Government Exhibits 4 through 10. \nThe Applicant also submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice of\ncertain facts relating to the current state of relations between the United States and the\nRepublic of India.  (Transcript at 16-19.)  The request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough H.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 57 and married.  He is employed by a Defense contractor as a\nSoftware Engineer and seeks a Secret level clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry.  In his Answer to the SOR, dated July 29, 2007,\nApplicant admitted subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c. and denied the other subparagraphs,\nwith explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country\nahead of the United States. \nThe Applicant was born in India in 1950.  His wife\u2019s uncle, an American citizen,\nsponsored the Applicant and his family for emigration to the United States beginning in\n1987.  The Applicant and his family waited patiently while the system worked and were\nallowed to emigrate to the United States in 1999.  He became a naturalized American\n\n3\ncitizen in March 2005.  (Government Exhibit 1, Section 3.).  His wife was born in India,\nand is also an American citizen.  (Transcript at 94.)  They were married in 1979, and\nhave two children born in India.  Both children are citizens of the United States\n(Government Exhibit 1, Section 9; Transcript at 47, 61.)  The Applicant credibly testified\nthat he does not believe himself to be a dual citizen of India and the United States.\n(Transcript at 101-102.)\nThe Applicant had an active Indian passport he acquired in 1998 when he was\nstill an Indian citizen.  This passport was valid through 2008.  (Government Exhibit 2.)\nWhen he was informed of the Government\u2019s concerns about his having an Indian\npassport, he submitted it to the Indian authorities.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I shows that the\nIndian authorities invalidated his passport with a stamp stating, \u201cPassport cancelled as\nacquired U.S. nationality.\u201d\nThe Applicant also submitted his current American passport.  The passport\nshows that it was properly used by the Applicant to travel to India in 2005, containing a\nvisa from the Indian government.  (Government Exhibit 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits J and K.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant has three brothers and three sisters.  One of his brothers lives in\nthe United States and is an American citizen.  (Transcript at 107-109.)  The Applicant\u2019s\nother siblings continue to live in India.  The Applicant has very little contact with his\nfamily in, or out, of India.  His primary contact is through his older brother, who the\nApplicant talks to about twice a year.  He is not close to the other members of his family,\nincluding his brother here in the United States.  (Transcript at 91-94, 103 -116.)\nSince moving to the United States in 1999, the Applicant has traveled to India\nthree times.  These trips occurred in 2003, 2005 and 2006.  The last two trips were after\nhe became an American citizen and were made using his American passport.\nThe Applicant\u2019s two daughters testified at length about their life in the United\nStates.  (Transcript at 47-80.)  The evidence shows that the daughters are loyal\nAmerican citizens who have quickly taken to American culture and have great pride in\nthis country and in their family.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.)  In addition, the evidence shows\nthat the Applicant and his family have more contacts with his wife\u2019s family, all of whom\nlive here and are almost all American citizens.\nThe Applicant testified that he wanted to move to the United States primarily for\nhis daughters, so they could achieve a good education.  After he arrived here, the\nApplicant saw how the American system was working and wanted to be part of it.  That\nis why he made the decision to become an American citizen.  (Transcript at 125-127.)\n\n\u201cResearch Establishment\u201d is not the real name of the organization.\n1\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel, or the\n2\nApplicant\u2019s counsel, in support of their respective requests for administrative notice.  (Administrative Judge\nExhibit I and attachments.)\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Background Note: India, dated\n3\nDecember 2006 at 10.\n4\nDuring his time in India, the Applicant worked for a Research Establishment\nconnected with the Indian Ministry of Defense (Research Establishment).   (Government\n1\nExhibit 3.)  The Applicant worked for the Research Establishment from 1976 to 1999 as\na Scientist.  His work at the Research Establishment was different from his current\nemployment.  The Applicant testified that he did not handle classified information during\nthe time he worked for the Research Establishment.  He has no continuing connections\nto the Research Establishment and does not receive any pension from the Indian\ngovernment in connection with his work there.  (Transcript at 86-91.)  \nThe Applicant has contacts with India.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to discuss\nthe relationship between India and the United States at this time.   India is a federal\n2\nrepublic, and the prime minister leads the executive branch of the government.  The\nUnited States is India\u2019s leading trading partner.  India generally respects the rights of its\ncitizens; however, numerous serious problems remain.  The United States has had\nconcerns over India\u2019s nuclear weapons program and the pace of economic reforms.  \u201cIn\nthe past, these concerns may have dominated U.S. thinking about India, but today the\nU.S. views India as a growing world power with which it shares common strategic\ninterests.\u201d   The United States recognizes India as a key to strategic U.S. interests.  The\n3\nrecent past has seen an increase in joint military exercises (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and\nB); progress on nuclear issues (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and G); an emphasis on defense\nindustry cooperation (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 3-4); and, a growing strategic partnership\nwith India (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters of recommendation.  They show that the\nApplicant is respected in his industry, and in his community.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits L and\nN.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\n\n6\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant may have been a dual citizen of India and the United States,\nand had a valid Indian passport in the recent past (Guideline C); and that the Applicant\nhas family members overseas, and he was employed by an entity of the Indian\ngovernment (Guideline B).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated\nthe Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nTurning first to Guideline C, the Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about his possible dual citizenship with India, and his possession of his Indian\npassport after becoming an American citizen.  The concern is stated thus under this\nGuideline, When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe Applicant had a valid Indian passport after becoming an American citizen.\nAccordingly, Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) applies to the facts of this case: Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \nThe Applicant sent his passport to the Indian authorities, who invalidated it for\nuse because he had become an American citizen.  Accordingly, as required by\nMitigating Condition 11(e) his Indian passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.  \nThe Applicant submitted credible testimonial evidence that he does not believe\nhimself to be a dual citizen of India and the United States.  The action of the Indian\ngovernment in invalidating his passport because of his acquisition of American\ncitizenship provides support of that position.  Mitigating Condition 11(b) applies to this\ncase: the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  In\naddition, Mitigating Condition 11(a) also applies as his dual citizenship is based solely\non parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Guideline C is found for the\nApplicant.\n\n7\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant has faint family connections to India.  For whatever reasons, it\nbecame obvious during the hearing that the Applicant and his family are much closer to\nhis wife\u2019s family, all of whom live in the United States and are almost all American\ncitizens.  His current family connections to India, which consists of twice yearly\ntelephone calls to his brother, are tenuous at best.  His trips to India are consistent with\nan American citizen visiting his prospective in-laws and returning for his daughter\u2019s\nwedding reception in India.\nThe Applicant worked for over 20 years for a defense related entity of the Indian\ngovernment.  I have considered this fact very carefully in this case, but I find that this\nconnection is mitigated.  I find this for several reasons: the Applicant stopped working\nfor this entity eight years ago; the Research Establishment, and the Applicant\u2019s work\nthere, is totally different from his current employment; the Applicant receives no pension\nfrom the Indian government for his work there; and, he has no personal connections\nwith any of his former co-workers.\nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the Indian\ngovernment, and in particular the current stance of the United States with regard to\nIndia.  Certainly, as shown by the Government, there have been concerns with India in\nthe past.  However, as abundantly shown by the Applicant, the strategic stance between\nthe United States and India has changed dramatically in the last few years in a more\npositive direction.  It is an important point when the Under Secretary of State for Political\nAffairs makes a major policy address specifically discussing in positive tones \u201can\nincrease in the defense industrial cooperation, along with an overall increase in the\nmilitary to military ties between the two governments [United States and India].\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 4.)  Finally, India is a democracy, heavily dependent on the\nUnited States.  There is little to no chance that the government of India would attempt to\nuse the Applicant\u2019s family against him, much less that he would respond positively to\nsuch an overture.  (See Transcript at 134.)   \n\n8\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Condition applies to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information. \nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn conclusion, I have also considered the information concerning the Indian\ngovernment and its relations with the United States, provided by Department Counsel\nand the Applicant\u2019s counsel.  After a review of all of the information, Paragraph 2 is\nfound for the Applicant.\n Whole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The evidence shows that the\nApplicant is a patriotic American citizen.  The Applicant eloquently testified about the\nimportance of his family in the United States, and his pride in being an American citizen\nand a member of the defense industry.  He is knowledgeable about security and\n\n9\nunderstands his responsibility.  I find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  Using the whole person\nstandard, the Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his foreign connections\nand alleged foreign preference and is eligible for a security clearance. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on May 16, 2006. On \nNovember 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 19, 2007; answered it \non December 7, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on December 11, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on December 27, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 18, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nFebruary 11, 2008.  \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant retained individual counsel on January 25, 2008. His counsel filed \nmotions for a continuance and change of venue on January 28, 2008; and I granted the \nmotions by order on January 31, 2008 (Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II). DOHA issued a \nsecond notice of hearing on February 1, 2008, scheduling the hearing for March 10, \n2008. On March 4, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel withdrew from representation (HX III).  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on March 10, 2008. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf. I granted his request to keep the record open until March 28, 2008, to \nenable him to submit additional evidence. He did not submit any additional evidence.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 18, 2008. The record closed \non March 28, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 3, DOHA interrogatories that included a \npersonal subject interview extracted from a report of investigation, without calling an \nauthenticating witness as required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the \nauthentication requirement to Applicant, and he waived it (Tr. 47). Accordingly, I \nadmitted GX 3.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations, but he disputed \nthe starting date of his excessive consumption of alcohol alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old assistant research engineer for a defense contractor.  \nHe has worked for his current employer since January 2000. He holds a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in computer science and is enrolled in a master\u2019s degree program. He received \na clearance in June 2000. \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol after his 21st birthday in 1996. At first he \nconsumed about one beer once a week. He recalled three occasions between 1998 and \n1999 when he became mildly intoxicated (Tr. 30-31). Around August 2002, he began \ndrinking 4-5 beers at a time and as much as 15-20 shots of hard liquor over the course \nof an evening (GX 3 at 5-6). \n \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant drank to the point of intoxication at a party and passed \nout on the front lawn of the residence where the party occurred. He was discovered by \nthe police, taken to a hospital, and eventually charged with public intoxication. He \npleaded guilty and paid a fine of about $300 (GX 3 at 4; GX 4).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAt a New Year\u2019s Eve party on January 1, 2004, Applicant became intoxicated, \nattempted to walk home, and passed out on a sidewalk. He was found by a policeman, \ntaken to a hospital, and charged with public intoxication. He pleaded guilty and paid a \nfine of about $300 (GX 3 at 4; GX 5). \n \n \nOn March 17, 2006, Applicant visited about three bars with friends, celebrating \nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day. He became heavily intoxicated, attempted to walk home, mistakenly \nentered someone else\u2019s residence instead of his own, and passed out. An occupant of \nthe residence summoned the police, who charged him with criminal trespass and \ncriminal mischief. He was convicted of the criminal mischief charge and fined about \n$600. \n \n \nAfter the St. Patrick\u2019s Day incident, Applicant stopped drinking hard liquor and \nlimited himself to three beers in an evening (GX 3 at 6). However, on his birthday in \nJune 2007, he consumed six drinks and considered himself too impaired to drive (Tr. \n34). \n \n \nApplicant testified he has not consumed any alcohol since November 2007 (Tr. \n29, 41, 45). He decided to stop consuming alcohol after receiving the SOR and reading \nGuideline G (Tr. 56). He has never received any counseling or treatment for his alcohol \nuse (Tr. 37). He has not participated in Alcoholics Anonymous or similar organizations \n(Tr. 46). He has never been evaluated by a medical professional. He testified he \nbelieves he can stop drinking on his own, without a support structure (Tr. 64). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n4 \n \n \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline G is set out in AG & 21 as follows: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, \u201cat times to excess and to \nthe point of intoxication,\u201d from about 1996 to at least March 2007. Based on the \nevidence of record, I conclude Applicant\u2019s excessive consumption of alcohol \ncommenced in 1998 as he asserted, and not in 1996 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The SOR \nalso alleges arrests and convictions for public intoxication in August 2003 and January \n2004 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), charges of alcohol-related criminal trespass and criminal mischief \nin March 2006, and a conviction of criminal mischief (\u00b6 1.d).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201calcohol-related incidents away from \nwork, such as driving while under the influence . . , disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related convictions \nraise this potentially disqualifying condition.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. AG \u00b6 22(c). \u201cBinge drinking\u201d is \n\u201cthe consumption of five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion.\u201d  U.S. Dept. \nof Health & Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, The  National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Binge Drinking Among \nUnderage Persons, Apr. 11, 2002, available at http://www.oas.samhsa.gov.  Applicant\u2019s \ndescription of his drinking habits raises AG \u00b6 22(c). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from alcohol consumption may be mitigated if \u201cso much \ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). The first prong (\u201cso \nmuch time has passed\u201d) is not established; because Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related \nconviction was only two years ago, and he did not stop drinking until November 2007, \nafter he received the SOR. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established in light \nof his multiple convictions and regular pattern of heavy drinking until his last conviction. \nThe third prong (\u201cunusual circumstances\u201d) is not established because his excessive \ndrinking occurred under normal social conditions, with no external pressures. Finally, \nthe record is insufficient to establish that his conduct is \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d He has not \nsought or received any counseling or treatment, and has no support structure for his \ncontinued sobriety. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if \nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG\u00b6 23(b).  Applicant has \nacknowledged his alcohol abuse, but has not sought treatment, counseling, or a support \ngroup. His period of abstinence, only about four months at the time of the hearing, was \ntriggered by the pressure of keeping his clearance, and it is too short to constitute a \n\u201cpattern\u201d of abstinence. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is not established.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, obviously intelligent adult. He was candid \nand sincere at the hearing. However, his drinking to the point of unconsciousness while \nholding a security clearance raises doubts about his judgment and reliability. His receipt \nof the SOR may have triggered a lifestyle change, but it is too soon to tell. His lack of \ntreatment, counseling, or a support structure militates against continued sobriety. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James W. Green, Esquire\nMay 22, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted two Questionnaires for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on\nJune 21, 2005 (Exhibit 1), and March 4, 2005 (Exhibit 2). On October 25, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline B for Applicant. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (RSOR) on November 1, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nJanuary 29, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 13, 2007, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 7, 2008, in San Diego, California. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 5.\n\n2\n     Applicant submitted Exhibits A through M. All of the exhibits were received without\nobjection. Applicant and five additional witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on March 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Hong Kong. The request and the attached documents were\nadmitted into evidence as Exhibit 5. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations in the SOR.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nother witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old and was born in Hong Kong in 1968. He moved to\nCanada in 1986, and moved to the United States in 1987. He became a naturalized\nUnited States citizen in 1999. Applicant received a Master\u2019s degree in Computer\nScience and Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Finance and Accounting from a United States\nuniversity.  Applicant is not married, and he has no children. \n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 3 allegations, 1.a. through 1.c., under Adjudicative Guideline B.\nThe allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens of Portugal (Macao) and reside in\nHong Kong, which is under the control of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nDespite Applicant\u2019s denial of this allegation of the SOR and the other two in his\nRSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations during his testimony.\nApplicant testified that his parents moved to Hong Kong when they were very\nyoung and have lived there since then, with the exception of 2001, when they lived in\nthe U.S. for approximately one year. Applicant speaks to them about once a week, and\nhe stated that he had a good relationship with them. Applicant further testified that his\nparents hold green cards from the United States, and they plan to move here when\nApplicant purchases a home in the U.S, which he estimated that would be within one\n\n3\nyear. Applicant previously owned homes in another part of the United States when he\nworked there. \nApplicant\u2019s father is 78, and he still works as an electrician for the company that\nhe owns. His mother is 76, and she has always been a housewife. Neither has ever\nworked for the Government of Hong Kong.\n1.b. Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen of Portugal (Macao) and resides in Hong Kong.\nApplicant is very close to his sister, who is 37 years of age. She works as a graphic\ndesigner. Applicant speaks to his sister once a month or once every other month.\nApplicant testified that he applied for a green card for his sister a few years ago, and\nshe also plans to move to the U.S., when she receives her green card. \n1.c. Applicant traveled to the PRC (including Hong Kong and /or Macao) during\nthe years 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005. He traveled to Taiwan in 2000 and 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s trips have been to visit his family and also for pleasure.  \nApplicant testified that his net worth in the United States is approximately\n$150,000. He has no assets in Hong Kong. \nApplicant has some other relatives in Hong Kong, but his only contact with them\nhas been when he has traveled there. \nHe has one cousin who lives in the United States, and he has contact with him\nonce a month. \nCurrent Status of Hong Kong\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Hong Kong. In 1997\nChina resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a Special\nAdministrative Region of the People's Republic of China (PRC) with a high degree of\nautonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs. According to the Sino-British\nJoint Declaration (1984) and the Basic Law, Hong Kong will retain its political,\neconomic, and judicial systems and unique way of life for 50 years after reversion and\nwill continue to participate in international agreements and organizations under the\nname Hong Kong, China. In the past two years, China has taken on a more active role\nin overseeing the Hong Kong Government's management of political developments in\nthe Special Administrative Region. While Hong Kong remains a free and open society\nwhere human rights are respected, courts are independent, and there is a well-\nestablished respect for the rule of law, Hong Kong groups have alleged manipulation or\npressure in connection with the September 12, 2004 Legislative Council election.\nUnder PRC nationality law, persons who are of Chinese descent and who were\nborn in the mainland of China or Hong Kong are PRC citizens. However, under an\nagreement between the United States and the PRC, all U.S. citizens entering Hong\nKong on their U.S. passports including such person as may be considered PRC\nnationals by the PRC authorities, are considered U.S. citizens by the Hong Kong SAR\nauthorities for purposes of ensuring consular access and protection.\n\n4\nAs discussed above, five witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. They all know\nhim through their mutual employment, and they have all worked with him for\napproximately three years. Applicant was described as \u201chonest, good character outside\nof work, outstanding work performance\u201d \nApplicant also submitted seven letters of recommendation (Exhibits A through G)\nin which the writers all spoke in extremely laudatory terms about Applicant.\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nApplicant\u2019s relatives, including his parents and his sister, who are residents of Hong\nKong, make DC (a) a concern to the Government.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. \n\n6\nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant, who is 39 years old, has lived in the United States for 20\nyears, more than half his life, and he and been a U.S. citizen since 1999. He received\nall of his education in the U.S. and has only worked here. His parents and his sister plan\nto move to the United States, and he has no continuing contact with any other residents\nof any county outside of the U.S. Finally, the witnesses who spoke on his behalf were\nextremely laudatory about Applicant\u2019s character and veracity. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) applies, I also find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts that Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising\nfrom his foreign influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 48 and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. The Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. The Applicant has had four alcohol-related arrests. He was arrested twice for Driving Under the Influence in 1990 and 1994. He was also arrested twice for being Drunk in Public in 1987 and 2003. (Government Exhibits 2. 3 and 4.) The Applicant began drinking when he was in college, starting in 1984. (Tr at 73- 75.) He would drink to intoxication on an infrequent basis while in college and up to about 1990. Applicant began working with his current employer in 1990. Until his entry into rehabilitation in April 2004, Applicant admits that he drank to excess on a regular basis. (Tr at 77-85.) Based on the recommendation of work friends, as well as his personal sense of humiliation after his last alcohol-related arrest, Applicant decided to enter inpatient alcohol treatment in April 2004. At discharge, he was diagnosed, in part, as being alcohol dependent. (Tr at 85-90; Government Exhibit 6.)

On September 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G concerning the Applicant. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on October 1, 2010, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non December 20, 2010. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2011. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on February 9, 2011, and I convened the hearing as\n\n2\nscheduled on March 11, 2011. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through\n7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits A through I, and called two additional witnesses. Pursuant\nto his request, the record remained open for the receipt of additional exhibits. Applicant\nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits J and K in a timely manner, which were also admitted\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) of the hearing on March 24, 2011.\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48 and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. The Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations of the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \nThe Applicant has had four alcohol-related arrests. He was arrested twice for\nDriving Under the Influence in 1990 and 1994. He was also arrested twice for being\nDrunk in Public in 1987 and 2003. (Government Exhibits 2. 3 and 4.) \nThe Applicant began drinking when he was in college, starting in 1984. (Tr at 73-\n75.) He would drink to intoxication on an infrequent basis while in college and up to\nabout 1990.\nApplicant began working with his current employer in 1990. Until his entry into\nrehabilitation in April 2004, Applicant admits that he drank to excess on a regular basis.\n(Tr at 77-85.)  \nBased on the recommendation of work friends, as well as his personal sense of\nhumiliation after his last alcohol-related arrest, Applicant decided to enter inpatient\nalcohol treatment in April 2004. At discharge, he was diagnosed, in part, as being\nalcohol dependent. (Tr at 85-90; Government Exhibit 6.) He successfully completed 30\ndays on inpatient treatment and then three months of living in a safe and sober housing\narrangement.\nApplicant remained abstinent from alcohol for about a year after completing his\ntreatment. Starting in mid-2005 Applicant began drinking a glass or two of wine in the\nevening. He limits himself to no more than two glasses of wine at any sitting. He has not\nbeen intoxicated since 2003. (Tr at 90-95.)\n\n3\nAt the hearing, Applicant presented Applicant Exhibit A, which stated that\nApplicant had the \u201cintent to never abuse alcohol again.\u201d As part of the exhibit, Applicant\nagreed to automatic revocation of his security clearance if there was any violation. (Tr at\n94-96, 100-102.)\nDuring his testimony Applicant stated that he was willing to give up drinking\nentirely effective immediately and sign a sworn statement to that effect. (Tr at 108-114.)\nAfter the hearing Applicant Exhibit J was admitted into evidence, which states, \u201cI am\nsubmitting this statement as intent to never use alcohol again.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nAs with Applicant Exhibit A, it also contained a statement stating his consent to\nautomatic revocation of his security clearance for any violation.\nMitigation\nTwo co-workers of Applicant testified, one of whom is also a personal friend. The\nco-worker who is a personal friend of the Applicant\u2019s testified that she has known\nApplicant since approximately 1994. She works in human resources for the Applicant\u2019s\nemployer. The witness was the person who drove Applicant to his inpatient treatment\nprogram in 2004. She stated that he came back to work a different person after his\nattendance at the program. She stated that the Applicant is an excellent employee, very\ntrustworthy, and recommended that the Applicant retain his security clearance.\n(Transcript at 21-38.)\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor also testified on his behalf. This person has\nknown the Applicant since 2001. He has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor for a year. The\nsupervisor testified that the Applicant is a valuable employee, above average, very\ntrustworthy and honorable. The witness has knowledge of the incidents in the SOR and\nbelieves that Applicant has resolved his problems. He also recommends that the\nApplicant retain his security clearance.  (Transcript at 41-64.)  \nApplicant has received several achievement and cash awards during his 20-year\nemployment in the defense industry. (Applicant Exhibit F.) He also submitted his last\nthree annual performance evaluations. (Applicant Exhibits G, H and I.) They show he is\na talented and respected employee, trusted by his supervisors as someone who,\n\u201cAccepts personal responsibility to meet commitments.\u201d\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG & 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was involved in four alcohol-related incidents between 1987 and\n2003. The evidence also shows that the Applicant has used alcohol, occasionally to\nexcess, from about 1980 until early 2004.  He had treatment in 2004, followed by a year\nof abstinence from alcohol. Since 2005, he drinks on an extremely moderate basis.\nThere are three Disqualifying Conditions that arguably apply to this case.  AG \u00b6\n22(a) \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d) states a concern is, \u201cDiagnosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional (e.g., physician . . .) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d In\naddition, AG \u00b6 22(f) states a concern is, \u201cRelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or\ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating condition currently\napplies to the Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23(a) states that it can be a mitigating\ncondition when, \u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d\nThe record shows that the Applicant had four alcohol-related incidents. Three\nbetween 1987 and 1994, the last occurring in 2003. After the 2003 incident, Applicant\nattended a 30-day inpatient treatment program in 2004 and was abstinent for a year.\nFor the last six years, he has used alcohol moderately without any incidents. Under the\nparticular facts of this case, his continued use of alcohol can be mitigated because of\nhis long history of good work, lack of alcohol-related incidents, and positive\nrecommendations. Applicant has restricted and controlled his drinking for six years, and\nhas now made a commitment to not drink at all. What is particularly telling is the\ncompelling, credible, testimony of the Applicant, and his two witnesses, including his\ndirect supervisor. These two people have intimate knowledge of the Applicant and his\nconduct on and off the job, and both recommend him for a position of trust and see no\nevidence of an alcohol problem. In addition, Applicant credibly stated his intent not to\nuse alcohol in the future. While this statement was made at the hearing, precluding any\nextensive current history of abstinence, the evidence supports a finding that it is credible\nand believable. This mitigating condition applies and, when viewed along with the\nWhole-Person Concept discussion below, supports a finding for the Applicant.\n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has had four alcohol-related incidents in his life, the\nlast in 2003. After treatment, and gaining significant insight into himself, Applicant began\nusing alcohol at a severely reduced rate. He has now indicated a credible intent not to\nuse alcohol at all in the future. Applicant fully understands how alcohol use, particularly\nany alcohol use in the future, can affect his security clearance eligibility. Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, Applicant has shown that there is little likelihood of\nrecurrence of his alcohol abuse.\nIn viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity significance of his prior conduct. As set forth at length above, I find that the\nconduct, specifically abusive drinking, was not recent (AG \u00b6 2(a)(3)); that there have\nbeen permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no serious questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant, a U.S. native citizen, acquired United Kingdom (U.K.) citizenship in about January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for potential future benefits (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that he has lived in the U.K. since about 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for a U.S. defense contractor (company X) since May 1996. For most of that time, he has 2 performed his duties as a self-employed consultant. In about August 2007, he became a direct employee of the company on a half-time basis. Company X requests that he be 3 granted a secret security clearance so that his expertise in artificial intelligence can be fully utilized in its defense projects (Tr. 13). Applicant was born in the U.S. to U.S. native citizens in May 1963. In August 1991, he earned his doctorate degree from a public university in the U.S. He was employed as a graduate research assistant at the university beginning in January 1986. After he earned his doctorate, he stayed on as an associate professor at the university. In 1996, he was given tenure, and he began independent consulting on the side as an expert in the field of artificial intelligence with company X.

On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\n1\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nSeptember 24, 2008\n\nThe SF 86 of record indicates Applicant started consulting for the company in May 1996 (Ex. 1). The\n2\ncompany\u2019s president/CEO and the FSO both testified that Applicant started consulting with the firm  in 1994\n(Tr. 13, 28).\nThe president/chief executive officer of company X testified that as a half-time employee, Applicant spends\n3\n50 percent of his time on their project. About eight to ten days on average per month, Applicant works at\ncompany X\u2019s facility in the U.S. He also does some work for the company in the U.K. (Tr. 15-16).\n2\n \nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR that was received by\nDOHA on July 7, 2008. Applicant requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative\njudge. On July 24, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. On\nJuly 28, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for August 27, 2008. The parties appeared as\nscheduled. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) were admitted. Applicant and two\nwitnesses testified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on\nSeptember 5, 2008. Based on review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant, a U.S.\nnative citizen, acquired United Kingdom (U.K.) citizenship in about January 2005 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a) for potential future benefits (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that he has lived in the U.K. since\nabout 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations. After considering the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for a\nU.S. defense contractor (company X) since May 1996.  For most of that time, he has\n2\nperformed his duties as a self-employed consultant. In about August 2007, he became a\ndirect employee of the company on a half-time basis.   Company X requests that he be\n3\ngranted a secret security clearance so that his expertise in artificial intelligence can be\nfully utilized in its  defense projects (Tr. 13).\nApplicant was born in the U.S. to U.S. native citizens in May 1963. In August\n1991, he earned his doctorate degree from a public university in the U.S. He was\nemployed as a graduate research assistant at the university beginning in January 1986.\nAfter he earned his doctorate, he stayed on as an associate professor at the university.\nIn 1996, he was given tenure, and he began independent consulting on the side as an\nexpert in the field of artificial intelligence with company X. Recruited by a U.K.\nuniversity, he took a sabbatical from his academic position with the U.S. university, and\nmoved to the U.K. in about July 1997 (Ex. 1, Tr. 45, 50).\nAfter he arrived in the U.K., he accepted employment as a senior research fellow\nat the U.K. university. Applicant thought it would be interesting to live in a foreign\ncountry and the position was related to his academic research (Tr. 44-46). He continued\nto consult for the U.S. defense contractor. Applicant subsequently incorporated in the\n\n3\nU.S. in January 2004, after another U.S. company would not pay him as a private\nSchedule C contractor. He remained the sole employee of his business, but thereafter\nhis earnings were paid into the corporation (Tr. 55). Initially he used his U.K. address for\nthe corporate address (Ex. 1). He recently changed it to his parents\u2019 address in the U.S.\nbecause it caused problems for a major U.S. defense contractor for which Applicant\nwas also consulting (Tr. 56-57). \nApplicant resided in university-provided housing in the U.K., which was located\nabout two hours from the airport (Tr. 46). He acquired permanent residency, and a year\nafter he was eligible, he applied for U.K. citizenship (Tr. 63) for medical benefits under\nthe national healthcare system primarily and in case he retires there (Ex. 2). He\nacquired U.K. citizenship about nine months later,  in January 2005 (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 48,\n62). He had to provide his U.S. passport, his work permit in the U.K., and proof of U.K.\nresidency, had to pay the equivalent of what would now be $700 USD, and had to affirm\nallegiance to the queen and to certain principles of the U.K. (Tr. 72-74). Applicant took\nno steps to acquire a U.K. passport and continued to travel on his U.S. passport (Ex. 2,\nEx. 3). He traveled extensively back to the U.S. to consult for company X (Tr. 46).\nAfter more than seven years there, Applicant left the U.K. university in May 2005\n(Ex. 1). In July 2005, Applicant accepted an academic position as a senior researcher\non a part-time basis (one day per week) at another U.K. university that was more\ncentrally located (Ex. 1). He had made contacts there through his research and wanted\nto be closer to the airport (Tr. 46). He continued his independent consulting, for\ncompany X as well as for several other companies.\nOn January 30, 2006, Applicant executed an e-QIP in application for a secret\nclearance for his work with company X. A SF 86 was subsequently prepared on March\n6, 2006, from information Applicant provided. He listed his dual citizenship with the U.S.\nand the U.K. \u201cfor about three years.\u201d He denied any intent to ever hold a U.K. passport.\nApplicant disclosed his employments with the U.K. universities, and his residency in the\nU.K. since July 1997. Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 17A concerning any\nforeign property, business connections, or financial interests, citing his employment in\nacademia in the U.K. He responded negatively to question 17B regarding whether he\nhad been employed by or consulted with a foreign government, firm, or agency.\nOn December 21, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his dual citizenship. Applicant explained that after years of working in the U.K., he\ndecided to acquire U.K. citizenship because he thought he might want to retire in the\nU.K. in the future and would want medical benefits. Concerning the medical, voting, and\nretirement benefits available because of his U.K. citizenship, Applicant denied he had\nvoted in a U.K. election, acquired a U.K. passport, performed any services for the U.K.\ngovernment, sought or held an office in the U.K., or maintained any financial interests in\nthe U.K. other than a bank account with about $14,000 USD on deposit. In contrast, he\nhad about $210,000 USD in US assets. Applicant indicated he had paid taxes in the\nU.K. He expressed his willingness to renounce his U.K. citizenship as a condition of\naccess, and claimed sole loyalty to the U.S. Applicant discussed his contacts with U.K.\n\n4\nnationals, which was on the order of once a year with the exception of a female friend\nwhom he contacted once every three weeks (Ex. 2).\nIn about August 2007, Applicant became an employee of company X on a half-\ntime basis (Ex. 2). He continued to reside in the U.K. in a rental unit. Due to Applicant\u2019s\nunique capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence, Company X wanted him to\nbecome a full-time employee but Applicant preferred to also continue his research in the\nU.K. (Tr. 15). The company owns the intellectual property rights to Applicant\u2019s work\nproduct that it did not have when he worked as an independent contractor (Tr. 20). By\nacquiring employee status Applicant committed to refrain from working with anyone else\nin the same areas as his work at company X (Tr. 20-21). Applicant has since spent\nabout two out of every five weeks at company X\u2019s facility in the U.S.  (Tr. 67), where he\nis a group leader, supervises another employee, and manages a project (Tr. 15-17, 29,\n34). Applicant also performs work for company X in the U.K. but it does not involve\ninformation that is restricted by international trade in armament regulations (ITAR) (Tr.\n19). The company has not found Applicant\u2019s U.K. residency to be a problem. To the\ncontrary, it has benefitted from research in the U.K. that Applicant has access to (Tr.\n21).\nOn April 29, 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories concerning any\nacquisition by him of a U.K. passport, any international travel since August 2004, any\nentry into the U.K. as a citizen of the U.K., any acceptance of benefits of his foreign\ncitizenship, and any voting in a foreign election. Applicant provided copies of two U.S.\npassports: a U.S. passport issued by the U.S. Embassy in the U.K. in November 1999\nand valid for ten years, and a second passport issued by the U.S. State Department\noutside of the U.S. in March 2008 valid for only one year (apparently because he ran\nout of pages in his current U.S. passport). Applicant indicated he had not acquired a\nU.K. passport and he denied any intent to acquire one as he had a permanent resident\nstamp from the U.K. in his U.S. passport. He indicated that since August 2004, he had\ntraveled to Germany for pleasure in 2006, to Brazil in 2008 to speak at a conference,\nand several times between the U.S. and the U.K. for company X business and to visit\nhis family in the U.S. Applicant denied ever voting in the U.K. but admitted that he\nreceived national healthcare benefits from the U.K. including prescription medications.\nAlthough he remained a U.K. resident, he denied it was to meet citizenship\nrequirements. In response for further facts that he believed might assist in determining\nhis security clearance suitability, Applicant stated: \u201cI only took UK citizenship for\npotential future benefits (e.g., healthcare). I do not intend to get a UK passport ever. I\nconsider my US citizenship primary.\u201d (Ex. 3).\nApplicant informed company X that he intends to relocate to the U.S. from the\nU.K. in a few years (Tr. 19, 22). The company\u2019s president/CEO is hopeful Applicant will\nthen work full-time for him (Tr. 19). He is aware Applicant has U.K. citizenship but is not\nconcerned knowing his character and loyalty to the U.S. Applicant has been\nconscientious in handling company proprietary information (Tr. 24). The company\u2019s\ndirector of administration/facility security officer (FSO) has also known Applicant since\nhe began consulting for the company. She is aware of his dual citizenship and that he\n\n5\nreceives medical benefits in the U.K. but is not presently concerned since he does not\nhave a U.K. passport (Tr. 31-32). Based on what he has told her, she understands that\nhe wants to keep his options open about possibly retiring to the U.K. but he does not\nhave any current plan to do so (Tr. 32). Concerning any exercise of his foreign\ncitizenship, she advised him that \u201csecurity doesn\u2019t like that too much and . . . that he\ncould not have two passports because that\u2019s not allowed.\u201d (Tr. 36).\nApplicant continues to have responsibilities at the U.K. university, since June\n2007 only about three hours per week (Tr. 44, 47). He advises a couple of doctorate\ndegree students and occasionally attends meetings to offer advice on the curriculum\n(Tr. 44). When Applicant is in the U.S. consulting for company X, he stays with a friend\nin the area (Tr. 30, 58). His parents reside in the U.S. in another state. His sister lives in\nSaudi Arabia with her family (Tr. 31, 69). Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is employed by a\nforeign oil company (Tr. 70).  \nApplicant denies any affiliation with the U.K. government and he considers\nhimself to be a loyal U.S. citizen. He thinks it \u201cvery likely\u201d that he will have to move back\nto the U.S. in the next year or so because of the expense of living in the U.K., but he\nhas enjoyed living and working in the U.K. (\u201cI do love living there and it will break my\nheart to leave. . . .\u201d Tr. 48). Applicant retains his U.K. citizenship for the option of\npossibly retiring to the U.K. in the future (\u201cIf I wanted to some day retire in England, I\u2019m\nnot sure that I would ever want to but if I wanted to, I could and I would have lifetime\nhealthcare, amongst other possible social benefits, so it\u2019s just an open door.\u201d Tr. 48).\nAlthough not his preference, he asserts a willingness to renounce his U.K. citizenship if\nnecessary for the clearance (Tr. 49, 64). As of August 2008, Applicant had taken no\nsteps to renounce his foreign citizenship.\nApplicant has a checking account in the U.K. with $6,000 USD on deposit as of\nAugust 2008 (Tr. 51-52). He uses that account for all of his general expenses (rent,\ngroceries) in the U.K. (Tr. 53, 55). All of his retirement funds are in the U.S. (Tr. 52), and\nhis earnings from his work for company X are deposited into a checking account in the\nU.S. (Tr. 54). Applicant receives mail in the U.S. at his parents\u2019 home, which is also his\ncorporate address. He stays at his parents\u2019 home about three or four weeks a year (Tr.\n58). When asked at his hearing for his address, Applicant gave that address in the U.S.\nrather than his U.K. address. Applicant pays federal and state income taxes, and\ncorporate taxes in the U.S. He pays taxes in the U.K. on the money that he earns in the\nU.K. and on any money that he brings over into the U.K. (Tr. 59). Applicant does not\nown any real estate in the U.S. or in the U.K. (Tr. 60). Applicant has voted in the U.S.\npresidential elections and in some state elections since moving to the U.K. He is\nregistered to vote in the state where his corporation is presently sited and where he\nreceives his mail. Applicant has never registered to vote in the U.K. To his\nunderstanding, he does not have a pension stake in the U.K. from his affiliation with\neither university (Tr. 61).\nApplicant has four close friends who live in the U.K. (Tr. 66), and has a girlfriend\nwhom he has been dating since May 2008. She is a resident citizen of the U.K. (Tr. 49-\n\n6\n50). Applicant has several close friends in the U.S., including the friend with whom he\nregularly stays when he is working onsite at company X (Tr. 65).\nSince about February 2008, Applicant has also consulted a couple days a week\nfor a U.K. company that formed out of the university that employed him from July 1997\nto May 2005. He had previously consulted for them, about one day every six months\n(Tr. 67). His income, invoiced to him as an independent consultant, is deposited directly\ninto his bank account in the U.K. and is not paid into his corporation in the U.S. (Tr. 68).\nAbout 30 percent of his $100,000 USD annual income comes from U.K. sources (this\nconsulting contract and his work at the university) (Tr. 69).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\n\n7\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the U.S. (AG \u00b6 9). A citizen of the U.S. from birth,\nApplicant moved to the U.K. in July 1997, initially while he was on sabbatical from a\ntenured academic position with a U.S. university. He accepted a senior research fellow\nposition with a U.K. university, and has since lived there while continuing to consult with\ncompany X and other U.S. firms. In January 2005, he voluntarily acquired U.K.\ncitizenship. Foreign preference security concerns are raised by any \u201caction to acquire or\nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen\u201d (AG \u00b6 10(b)). He also\ncurrently receives medical benefits under the U.K\u2019s national healthcare system.  AG \u00b6\n10(a)(3), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This\nincludes but is not limited to: (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social\nwelfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country\u201d also applies.\nThe government\u2019s case for potential disqualification under AG \u00b6 10(a)(4),\n\u201cresidence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements\u201d is less persuasive,\nhowever. While Applicant had to prove legal residency as a precondition for U.K.\ncitizenship, he did not remain in the U.K. for the purpose of establishing the residency\nrequired for citizenship. He has lived in the U.K. since 1997 because of academic\nopportunities, and more so of late, enjoyment of the lifestyle and environment. In the\nabsence of any evidence that U.K. residency is required to maintain his U.K. citizenship,\nAG \u00b6 10(a)(4) does not currently apply.\nApplicant bears a substantial burden to overcome the implications of foreign\npreference raised by his voluntary acquisition of foreign citizenship. Although Applicant\nclaims no particular affinity for the U.K. government, he affirmed allegiance to the queen\nand to abide by certain U.K. principles when he became a U.K. citizen. The U.S.\ngovernment does not encourage its citizens to be dual nationals because of the\ncomplications that might ensue from obligations owed to the foreign country, and the\n\nThe government did not request that I take administrative notice of any particular facts concerning the U.K.\n4\nor its relations to the U.S. The close relations shared by the U.S. and the U.K., both historically and currently,\nare well known. In its Background Note: United Kingdom, dated July 2008, the U.S. State Department states,\nin part:\nThe United Kingdom is one of the United States' closest allies, and British foreign\npolicy emphasizes close coordination with the United States. Bilateral cooperation reflects\nthe common language, ideals, and democratic practices of the two nations. Relations were\nstrengthened by the United Kingdom's alliance with the United States during both W orld\nW ars, and its role as a founding member of NATO, in the Korean conflict, in the Persian Gulf\nW ar, and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The United Kingdom and the United States continually\nconsult on foreign policy issues and global problems and share major foreign and security\npolicy objectives.\nThe United Kingdom is the fifth-largest market for U.S. goods exports after Canada,\nMexico, Japan, and China, and the sixth-largest supplier of U.S. imports after Canada, China,\nMexico, Japan, and Germany. U.S. exports of goods and services to the United Kingdom in\n2006 totaled $92 billion, while U.S. imports from the U.K. totaled $93 billion. The United\nStates has had a trade deficit with the United Kingdom since 1998. The United Kingdom is\na large source of foreign tourists in the United States. In 2007, an estimated 3.1 million U.S.\nresidents visited the United Kingdom, while 4.5 million U.K. residents visited the United\nStates. \nThe United States and the United Kingdom share the world's largest foreign direct\ninvestment partnership. U.S. investment in the United Kingdom reached $324 billion in 2005,\nwhile U.K. direct investment in the U.S. totaled $282 billion. This investment sustains more\nthan 1 million American jobs.\n8\ninterests of even the closest of allies such as the U.S. and U.K. are not always\ncompletely aligned.4\nAG \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship\u201d applies, but it is entitled to less weight in mitigation if it is conditional.\nApplicant has consistently indicated that he would be willing to renounce his U.K.\ncitizenship as a condition of access to classified information, but that he would prefer to\nretain U.K. citizenship to keep his future options open with respect to possibly retiring in\nthe U.K. where he would be entitled to medical and perhaps other social benefits.\nApplicant has been on notice for some time that his foreign citizenship was of some\nconcern to the Department of Defense. When he told company X\u2019s FSO that he had\nbecome a U.K. citizen, she informed him \u201csecurity\u201d does not approve of such conduct\nand that acquisition of a foreign passport was not allowed. He has never acquired a\nU.K. passport. However, his failure to take any steps toward renunciation of his U.K.\ncitizenship after a government interview in December 2006 and the issuance of the\nSOR confirms his preference to remain a U.K. citizen. Applicant testified about his U.K.\ncitizenship that it was not a big deal to him, that \u201cit\u2019s a nicety.\u201d (Tr. 64). His inaction in\nthe face of the government\u2019s concerns suggests otherwise.\n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant affirms his primary loyalty is to the U.S., and his actions do not show\nany particular affinity for the U.K. government or political system. He has traveled\nexclusively on a U.S. passport and has never voted in a British election. Yet, the salient\nissue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty or allegiance, but\nrather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order 10865,\nSection 7. Despite considerable financial assets in the U.S., and company X\u2019s\nwillingness to employ him full time in the U.S., Applicant has chosen to stay in the U.K.\nwhere he consults a couple days a week for a U.K. company, has a girlfriend, receives\nmedical benefits, and clearly prefers living. He testified that it would \u201cbreak his heart\u201d\nshould he have to return to the U.S. to live in the next few years for financial reasons.\nHe was motivated to obtain his foreign citizenship to ensure his future availability for\nmedical and perhaps other public benefits. His ongoing acceptance of, and continuing\neligibility for, medical benefits in the U.K. makes him more likely to act in preference for\nthe U.K. than he might otherwise as a citizen solely of the U.S., who is living and\nworking in the U.K. Notwithstanding his record of appropriate handling of proprietary\ninformation for company X, I am unable to conclude at this time that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 27, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86), on March\n13, 2006 (Government Exhibit 1).  On September 16, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 9, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non January 15, 2008.  I received the case assignment on January 25, 2008.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 26, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 8, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through L, without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on March 6, 2008. The record closed on March 6, 2008.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 56 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an\naircraft mechanic and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant denied this allegation.  This alleged past due\ndebt with Bank of America is shown on several of the Government\u2019s credit reports under\ntwo different account numbers.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2 and Government Exhibit 3\nat 2.)  The Applicant provided a letter from the creditor referring to both account\nnumbers and stating, \u201cThe above referenced obligation with Bank of America was\nsettled in full and closed.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant denied this allegation.  The Applicant has\nconsistently denied that he has ever had a past due account with Citi, or that he owes\nany money to this creditor, or their collection agency.  The record shows that the\nApplicant has attempted to resolve this situation since 2006.  (Government Exhibits 2 at\n4, 5 at 3, 6 at 3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, E and H; Transcript at 64-72.)  Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit H at page 1 is a letter from one of the collection agencies on this account.  This\nletter is dated August 10, 2007, and states, \u201cInformation provided by you regarding this\naccount has been forwarded to the Customer Service Department for Research.\u201d  The\nApplicant also submitted three different credit reports, each dated June 18, 2007.  None\nof these credit reports shows the debt to Citi or any of its successors.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits J, K and L.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s credit history shows that, in the last few years, he has been\ntimely in his payments to the vast majority of his creditors.  His most recent credit report,\nGovernment Exhibit 6, shows over 30 accounts and, with the exception of the two\naccounts in the SOR, all are timely or have been paid and closed.  The Applicant\ntestified that he has refinanced his house twice in the past several years and used the\nmoney to pay off most of his debts.  Many of these debts were accrued during a time\nwhen he had employment difficulties.  (Transcript at 32-35, 38-40.)  He usually pays\nmore than the minimum payment due to his creditors on a monthly basis.  The Applicant\nfurther stated that he has more than sufficient funds to pay the creditor in Subparagraph\n1.b., but he does not believe the debt to be his.  (Transcript at 72-94.)\n\n3\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns.  Despite his denials, there is some documentary evidence showing\nthat he may owe the debts in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.  The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant was laid off\nseveral times between 2000 and 2003.  He refinanced his house in order to pay his\ncredit card debt.  The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant\nsuccessfully showed that he does not owe Bank of America any money.  With regards\nto Citi and its collection agencies, he has consistently denied owing them money, and\nthoroughly documented his disputes about that debt.  I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition applies.\nFinally, \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  As set forth at length above, the\nApplicant has a legitimate dispute with both creditors.  He has thoroughly documented\nhis efforts to resolve these debts, and has successfully resolved one of them.  This\nmitigating condition clearly applies to the facts of this case.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a good credit\nhistory, with the exception of the debts of concern here.  He has legitimate disputes with\nthese creditors, and has behaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve\nthem.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Such language is not the\nproduct of reasonable inference, and was speculative. The Board does not evaluate a passage in a\ndecision in isolation.  The Board will evaluate passages with reference to the decision as a whole,\nwhen determining if the language has any harmful effect. The gravamen of the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity decision was his finding that Applicant deliberately concealed his drug use from the\ngovernment and did so to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. The\nJudge also stressed the importance of truthfulness and honesty in those persons who hold\nclearances and the desirability of giving clearances to those persons who are willing to be\nscrupulously honest in dealing with classified information.  The Judge\u2019s doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s ability to be trustworthy under such circumstances serve as an adequate basis for his\nultimate decision.  Applicant correctly points out that the Judge\u2019s decision was bereft of any\nmention of Guideline J mitigating factors.  As the Judge concluded that Guideline J disqualifying\nfactors were operative in the case, he was obligated to give some indication that he considered\nGuideline J mitigating factors.

DeLaney, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLeslie McAdoo Gordon, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 25, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge relied heavily on\nevidence that was neither contained in the written record, nor proffered by either party at the hearing;\n(2) whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that no mitigating factors applied to Applicant\u2019s case was\nerroneous; and (3) whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was arbitrary and capricious.  Finding\nno harmful error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  In the process of applying for a security\nclearance, Applicant completed two security clearance questionnaires, one in December 2005 and\none in May 2006.  The first application was completed on-line with the help of his mother.  Question\n24 of those applications asked him about drug use within the last seven years.  Applicant answered\n\u201cno\u201d on both applications, even though he had used marijuana at least four times each during the\nsummer of 2001 and the fall of 2004.  Applicant later disclosed his marijuana use to his facility\nsecurity officer in September 2006.  Applicant knew that his company\u2019s plan was to eventually grant\nhim access to sensitive compartmented information, and he knew the background investigation\nwould include a personal interview with an investigator and a polygraph examination.  Thus, his\ndrug use and falsifications could become an issue in the clearance process.  Before being contacted\nby an investigator, Applicant prepared a written account of his drug use and falsifications, stating\nthat he concealed his drug use because be was very scared of admitting it to an authority figure and\nhis parents.  During an interview in October 2006, Applicant repeated this information to an\ninvestigator, who noted in his report Applicant\u2019s stated fear of embarrassment and not getting his\nclearance as reasons for concealing his drug use.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant deliberately concealed his drug use from the government\nand did so knowing that his illegal drug use was of security concern to the government, and believing\n\nThe fact that Applicant\u2019s conduct would have raised a security concern does not mean that he would have\n1\nultimately been denied a clearance after investigation.  However, Applicant\u2019s citation to the Administrative Desk\nReference describes an analytical process in evaluating drug use that the government was prevented from engaging in\nas a result of Applicant\u2019s falsifications.  Thus, the government\u2019s investigation was affected.\n See Footnote No. 1.  Also, in evaluating any claim that the Judge\u2019s pronouncements about Applicant\u2019s security\n2\nclearance investigation are \u201cspeculative,\u201d it is reasonable to assume that DOHA Administrative Judges have a passing\nfamiliarity with the rudiments of the security clearance investigative process.\n3\nthat his clearance was at risk if he told the truth.  The Judge concluded that Applicant misled both\nhis employer and the government, not withstanding Applicant\u2019s claims that his principal reason for\nconcealing his drug use was fear of his parents\u2019 reaction.  The Judge also concluded that none of the\nGuideline E mitigating conditions applied, asserting specifically that Applicant\u2019s revelations of his\nfalsehoods were not prompt.  The Judge also resolved the Guideline J allegation against Applicant\nwithout any discussion.  The Judge did provide a detailed analysis of the case under the more general\nfactors listed in paragraph 2 (a) of the Adjudicative Guidelines, and concluded Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his falsifications.   \nApplicant asserts on appeal that the Judge relied upon evidence that was not contained in the\nrecord when reaching his conclusions.  Specifically, Applicant states that throughout his decision,\nthe Judge mentions that Applicant obtained his security clearance only because of the falsifications\non his applications, and that, had he been honest, there would have been either a further inquiry into\nhis drug use or a denial of clearance.  The Applicant cites to such passages in the decision as \u201c . . .\nbased on [his] false answers, [he] obtained his clearance[s] . . . .  \u201d (Decision at 2), the government\n\u201cdetrimentally relied\u201d on Applicant\u2019s falsifications in granting his clearance (Decision at 4),\nApplicant \u201c . . . collected benefits from his falsifications\u2013obtaining first his initial clearance, then\nan interim upgrade.\u201d (Decision at 4), that Applicant was willing to \u201cbenefit from his misconduct,\u201d\n(Decision at 5),  that Applicant \u201cintended to . . . effect [sic] the course of his background\ninvestigation . . . .\u201d (Decision at 4), and \u201cApplicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the government from\nevaluating his illegal drug use in a timely fashion, and at a time when such recent drug use might\nhave raised significant security concerns.\u201d (Decision at 4).  Applicant argues that these statements\nby the Judge are not based on record evidence, are no more than speculative assumptions, and were\nimproperly relied upon by the Judge in making his adverse clearance decision.    \nSome, but not all, of the Judge\u2019s language cited by Applicant is problematic.  The Board does\nnot regard as error the Judge\u2019s statements concerning the manner in which Applicant\u2019s falsifications\naffected the government\u2019s investigation, including the timing of that investigation.  It is proper for\nJudges to draw reasonable inferences from the record evidence and to make findings of fact based\non those inferences.  It was reasonable, and not speculative, for the Judge to infer that the subject of\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications\u2014his drug use\u2014would have raised security concerns for government\ninvestigators at an early stage, had they known about it.   It was also reasonable for the Judge to infer\n1\nthat Applicant\u2019s falsifications affected the manner in which the investigation was conducted and the\ntime it took to complete it.   The Judge\u2019s observation that the government relied to its detriment on\n2\nApplicant\u2019s false answers when granting him his initial clearance is axiomatic.\n\n4\nMore problematic are the Judge\u2019s statements suggesting that had Applicant initially been\ntruthful about his marijuana use, he would have been denied his clearance, and that his falsifications\nwere the sole determining factor in the granting of his clearance.  Such language is not the product\nof reasonable inference, and was speculative.  As a result of this error, the Board must evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s claim that it formed the basis for the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision in the case.  In arguing\nthat the error was harmful, Applicant notes correctly that the Judge used this language several times\nin his decision.  Notwithstanding this fact, the Board does not evaluate a passage, or even several\npassages, in a decision in isolation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10216 at 6 n.4 (App. Bd. Jan 30,\n2004).  Rather, the Board will evaluate such passages with reference to the decision as a whole, when\ndetermining if the language complained of has any harmful effect.  In this case, after a consideration\nof the entire record and the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, the Board concludes that the gravamen of\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse security decision was his finding that Applicant deliberately concealed his drug\nuse from the government and did so to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests. The Judge also stressed the importance of truthfulness and honesty in those persons who\nhold clearances and the desirability of giving clearances to those persons who are willing to be\nscrupulously honest in dealing with classified information\u2014even to the extent of reporting one\u2019s\nown breeches of security to the government.  The Judge indicated that he had doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s ability to be trustworthy under such circumstances, and those doubts serve as an\nadequate basis for his ultimate decision against Applicant.\nApplicant raises the issue of the Judge\u2019s treatment of various mitigating factors in the case.\nCentral to Applicant\u2019s argument is his interpretation of the Judge\u2019s discussion of the mitigating\nfactors as indicating the Judge\u2019s belief that there was no possibility that any of the Guideline E\nmitigating factors could serve to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  While Applicant\u2019s\nargument on this point is not a model of clarity, he appears to assert that, once the falsification was\nestablished, the Judge viewed the case as one that could not be mitigated per se, and thus ignored\nor failed to consider the mitigating factors.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the case unless\nthere is a clear statement to the contrary.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-15308 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug.\n2, 2005).  There is also a presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties\nproperly and in good faith.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001).  With\nthese presumptions in mind, and after a review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge did not ignore or categorically dismiss the mitigating factors in this case.\nThe Judge specifically mentions the fact that Applicant came forward to correct the falsification on\nhis own, and the Judge gives him some credit for it.   The Judge ultimately decided not to apply the\nmitigating factor in Applicant\u2019s favor however, owing to the fact that the coming forth could not be\nconsidered \u201cprompt.\u201d  The fact that the Judge engaged in this specific analysis belies Applicant\u2019s\nassertion that he ignored the mitigating factors.  Applicant points out that none of the other Guideline\nE mitigating factors were discussed by the Judge and that this lack of discussion equates to the\nJudge\u2019s failure to articulate a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  While a detailed and\ncomprehensive discussion of numerous mitigating factors is sometimes useful, there is no\nrequirement that a Judge provide a detailed analysis as to the applicability or non-applicability of\nevery disqualifying or mitigating factor listed under a particular Guideline.  Also, decisions of\n\n5\nDOHA Judges are not measured against a standard of perfection.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0319\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 1996).  In this case, under these facts and considering the mitigating factors\nenumerated for application under Guideline E, the Board does not conclude that the Judge\u2019s analysis\nof potential Guideline E mitigating factors was inadequate or that his exposition of that analysis in\nhis decision was inadequate.  Applicant mentions on appeal that, during the hearing below, he cited\nnumerous mitigating factors that arguably applied to the facts of this case.  The fact that Applicant\ndisagrees with the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating factors, or can articulate an alternative\ninterpretation of the record evidence that would bring such factors into more prominent play does\nnot establish that the Judge\u2019s analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 06-08111 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).\nApplicant correctly points out that the Judge\u2019s decision was bereft of any mention of\nGuideline J mitigating factors.  As the Judge concluded that Guideline J disqualifying factors were\noperative in the case, he was obligated to give some indication that he considered Guideline J\nmitigating factors.  Failure to do so was error.  However, the Board views this error as ultimately\nharmless in that the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is supportable given his sustainable analysis under\nGuideline E.               \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s application of the whole person concept to this case was\narbitrary and capricious, because he did not examine relevant evidence, he failed to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for his conclusions, and his conclusion does not reflect a reasonable\ninterpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  As the trier of fact, the Judge must weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  In his whole person analysis, the Judge specifically listed numerous generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating factors in some detail before concluding that they led to the\nsame result he reached when considering the more specific factors under Guidelines E and J.  It is\nundisputed that Applicant deliberately falsified information about drug use on two separate security\nclearance applications.  Given these facts, Applicant bears the burden of presenting evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate that potentially disqualifying conduct, and had the ultimate\nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant failed to meet that burden is sustainable on this record.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant requests that, if the Board concludes that the decision of the\nJudge should be remanded, that the case be remanded with a recommendation that the case be\nassigned to a different Judge.  The basis for the request is Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge in this\ncase has proven in his decision that he is unwilling to apply any mitigating factors to this case, and\nbelieves simply that there is no way to mitigate a falsification.  Applicant\u2019s request could be\nconstrued as an assertion of bias on the part of the Judge.\nA party asserting a claim of bias against a Judge has a particularly high burden to satisfy on\nappeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001).  Applicant has not met that\nburden, in that he has not identified anything in the record that indicates a basis for a reasonable\nperson to conclude that the Judge was biased.\n\n6\nOrder   \nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Based on his\n2\nfalse answers, Applicant obtained his clearance in April 2006 (G.E. 3).\nBefore starting full-time employment, Applicant\u2019s company nominated him for a\nhigher level of clearance, and he completed a second clearance application in May\n2006 (G.E. 2). Again, he deliberately concealed his marijuana use by answering \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 24. Based on his false answers, Applicant obtained an interim upgraded\nclearance in July 2006 (G.E. 3).\nApplicant had been nominated for a higher level of clearance in expectation that\nhe would eventually be given access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). He\nknew that his background investigation would include a personal interview with an\ninvestigator, and eventually a polygraph examination. He realized that his drug use and\nfalsifications might be an issue in the clearance process. He disclosed this information\nto his facility security officer (FSO), who advised him to prepare a written statement\nabout the drug use and falsification, either to be sent to the government or taken by\nApplicant to his interview. On 26 September 2006, before he had been contacted by the\ninvestigator, he prepared a detailed account of his drug use and falsifications (A.E. A).\nIn his letter, he acknowledged concealing his drug use because he was \u201cvery scared of\nadmitting it to an authority figure and my parents.\u201d During his interview on 17 October\n2006, Applicant disclosed essentially the same information to the investigator, who\nnoted Applicant\u2019s stated fear of embarrassment and not getting his clearance as\nreasons for concealing his drug use (G.E. 4).\nApplicant stated that he falsified his December 2005 clearance application\nbecause he was competing the application on-line, at home, with his mother looking\nover his shoulder. She knew all the details of Applicant\u2019s life required by the application,\nand she had previously helped him with similar forms. When they came to the drug\nquestion, she just assumed the answer was \u201cno\u201d and Applicant did not contradict her,\nhe just clicked \u201cno.\u201d Similarly, when he was completing his May 2006 clearance\napplication, he was on-line, in his college dormitory room, but was on the telephone with\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\nhis mother getting necessary updates for the required information. In this case, he\nconcealed his drug use because he knew he would be living at home after college and\ndid not want to risk having his parents discover the printed copy of the application that\nhe would have with him when he came home. However, he admits that having\nsubmitted the false answers, he took no action to disclose them to his employer until\nSeptember 2006. And although there are no government records that would otherwise\nhave disclosed his drug use, Applicant acknowledged that he has told some of his close\nfriends about his drug use. He is remorseful for his falsifications.\nApplicant\u2019s work references, who include the FSO, his supervisor, and the\npresident of the company, consider Applicant an excellent employee and praise his\nhonesty and integrity. All are aware of the drug and falsification issues in this case. All\nrecommend Applicant for his clearance.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\n\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\n4\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n5\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E and J,\nand Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his\nillegal drug use from the government.  He did so knowing that his illegal drug use was of\n4\nmajor security concern to the government, and believing that his clearance were at risk\nif he told the truth. Even crediting his claims that his principal reason for concealing his\ndrug use was fear of his parents\u2019 reaction and he had no intention of misleading either\nhis company or the government, the fact remains that he did mislead both his employer\nand the government, and collected benefits from his falsifications\u2014obtaining first his\ninitial clearance, then an interim upgrade.\nFurther, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed\ninformation was relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the\ngovernment from evaluating his illegal drug use in a timely fashion, and at a time when\nsuch recent drug use might have raised significant security concerns. In addition, the\ngovernment detrimentally relied on Applicant\u2019s falsifications in granting his clearance.\nFinally, while his disclosure of illegal drug use in October 2006 may have been\nforthright, it cannot be considered prompt. While I give Applicant some credit for coming\nforth on his own, that credit is diluted by several factors. It is irrelevant that no\ngovernment records would have otherwise disclosed his drug use. Applicant\u2019s are\nexpected to tell the government the truth anyway. In addition, the right references or\ndeveloped references in his background investigation might have revealed his\nRecord evidence clearly establishes that Applicant intended to conceal his illegal\ndrug use from the government and effect the course of his background investigation.\nThis conduct violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001,  whether or not he was successful in effecting\n5\nthe course of his investigation. However, in this case his falsifications did alter the\ninvestigation, as he was granted his clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use demonstrates a lack of candor\nrequired of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant\nand material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance\ndecision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse\ninformation in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient.\nFurther, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides\nsome indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other\nsecurity concerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage\nassessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct\n\n5\nsuggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests. I resolve Guideline E and J against Applicant.\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Falsifications\nare a core security concern [RAG &2(a)(1)]. His behavior was deliberate and not due to\ncircumstances beyond his control [RAG &2(a)(2); RAG &2(a)(5)]. His misconduct was\nboth recent and frequent [RAG &2(a)(3)]. I have considered Applicant\u2019s youth, but that\nconsideration provides does not overcome the adverse inferences of his misconduct,\nhonesty being a core requirement for access, and not a difficult concept to understand\nor hold Applicant\u2019s to [RAG &2(a)(4).)] Rehabilitation or behavioral changes are difficult\nto measure under these circumstances, given the scrutiny Applicant has been under\nsince his drug use came to light [RAG & 2(a)(6)]. He clearly sought to mislead the\ngovernment about his drug record, or was at least willing to benefit from his misconduct\n[RAG &2(a)(7)]. Applicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests increases his potential vulnerability and he has not demonstrated\nthat the misconduct is unlikely to recur [RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9)]. The concern is\nwhether Applicant would disclose situations or circumstances, whether deliberated or\ninadvertent, that raise security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial\ndoubt about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nfalsifications.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Voelker, Esq. \n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guidelines C and E is not at issue in this appeal.\n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 14, 2007,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June\n30, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge improperly\nshifted the burden of persuasion to the Government; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the\ngovernment had presented no evidence of heightened risk; and whether the Judge erred in concluding\nthat Applicant\u2019s case did not raise Guideline B security concerns.   Finding error, we remand the case\n1\nto the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Russia, then\npart of the U.S.S.R.  She received a Master\u2019s degree in computer science there.  She married, and\nshe and her husband had a son together.  Her husband subsequently died.\nIn the 1990s she came to the U.S. with her son and married a U.S. citizen, whom she later\ndivorced.

Applicant has an aunt who lives in Ukraine, which used to be a member of the U.S.S.R.\nApplicant traveled to Russia in the early 2000s to attend her brother\u2019s wedding.  She also traveled\nto Ukraine to visit her aunt.  Applicant holds a Russian passport, because that it a requirement for\nrenouncing Russian citizenship.\nRussia is a \u201cnominal democracy with a mixed human rights record.\u201d  Decision at 4.  It has\nbeen a target of terrorist activity in recent years, and Russian forces pursuing terrorists have engaged\nin torture, summary executions, and arbitrary detentions.  \u201cRussia has an active, significant, recent,\nand ongoing collecting program focusing on the U.S.  As of 2005, Russia was one of the two most\naggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounted for much of such\ntargeting.  However, Russia is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information.\u201d\nId. at 4.  \n\n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s assignment of error includes mixed questions of law and fact.\nConsideration of the assigned errors requires the Board to address the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings about the geopolitical situation in Russia and Russia\u2019s targeting of Americans and American\ninformation. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s case did not raise security concerns under Guideline\nB.  \u201cIn this case, the government failed to establish a case under Guideline B.  Considering first the\ncountry involved, Russian and the U.S. enjoy competitive foreign relations, although they cooperate\non a wide variety of issues.  While Russia is actively engaged in the collection of U.S. information\n. . . there is no evidence suggesting that it targets its expatriate citizens such that would make\nApplicant or her family members likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence.\u201d  Decision at 7.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred.  He states that, viewed in light of the whole record,\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.7(a): \u201ccontact with a foreign family member . . . or other person who is a citizen of or\n2\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.7(b): \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information[.]\u201d\n For a discussion of official notice in DOHA proceedings, see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Apr.\n3\n12, 2007).   \nDirective \u00b6 E2.6: \u201cThe Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\n4\ndivided loyalties . . . may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under\nthis Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact . . . is located.\u201d\n4\nApplicant\u2019s foreign relatives, her foreign travel, Russia\u2019s problematic human rights record, and its\nstatus as a collector of U.S. technological information are sufficient to raise Guideline B security\nconcerns.   The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.  \n2\nThe Board notes certain events which have occurred since the close of the record and which\nhave a bearing on this case.  In August 2008 Russia attacked Georgia.  See President\u2019s \u201cRemarks on\nthe Situation in Georgia,\u201d August 18, 2008:  \u201cIt now appears that an effort may be underway to\ndepose Georgia\u2019s duly elected Government.  Russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and\nthreatens a democratic government elected by its people.\u201d   See also Joint Statement on Georgia by\nForeign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the United\nKingdom, Department of State Media Note, August 27, 2008: \u201cRussia\u2019s recognition of the\nindependence of South Ossetia and Abkhazai violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of\nGeorgia and is contrary to U.N. Security Council Resolutions supported by Russia.  Russia\u2019s\ndecision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the Caucasus.\u201d   The Board\n3\nalso notes that the Judge made no findings about Ukraine, which is an error.  See ISCR Case No. 06-\n18400 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007).     \nA current and accurate assessment of the \u201cgeopolitical situation\u201d and the\n\u201csecurity/intelligence profile of the country vis-a-vis the United states\u201d is crucial in Guideline B\ncases.  See ADP Case No. 06-14978 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 11, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007).  In this case, Applicant has close relatives who are citizens of a country\nthat has engaged in armed conflict with a democracy friendly with the U.S.  See U.S. Department\nof State Background Note: Georgia, February 2008.  This is a matter bearing directly on the\nGuideline B security concern, which requires consideration of the nature of the foreign country.   The\n4\nBoard concludes that the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge with instructions\nthat he reopen the record, allow the parties an opportunity to proffer appropriate documents for\nofficial notice pertinent to the geopolitical situation in Russia, or other relevant and material\nevidence, and allow the parties to reargue the case.  The other issues in the case are not ripe for\nconsideration at this time.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.     \nSigned; Michael Y.

She first married in September 1992, at age 19, and she and her husband had a son together, born about a year before they divorced in August 1994. Her ex-husband is now dead. In September 1996, she immigrated to the U.S. with her son on a fianc\u00e9 visa, having accepted an offer of marriage from a native born U.S. citizen.

Voelker, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 14 September 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines C , B, and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 15 October 2007, and requested\n1\na hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 3 December 2007, and I convened a hearing\n10 January  2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 18 January 2008.\n \n\nAt hearing, Department Counsel stated his intent to not pursue SOR allegations 1.d. and 3.a., and requested\n2\nthat I enter formal findings for Applicant on those two allegations. I have done so.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.d. and 3.a.  She is a\n2\n34-year-old senior website developer employed by a defense contractor since August\n2007. She has not previously held a security clearance.\nApplicant was born in Russia, then a part of the U.S.S.R., in September 1973.\nShe grew up and was educated there, eventually obtaining the equivalent of a master\u2019s\ndegree in computer science in October 1995. She first married in September 1992, at\nage 19, and she and her husband had a son together, born about a year before they\ndivorced in August 1994. Her ex-husband is now dead.\nIn September 1996, she immigrated to the U.S. with her son on a fianc\u00e9 visa,\nhaving accepted an offer of marriage from a native born U.S. citizen. They married in\nDecember 1996 and divorced in June 2000. They had no children together. Applicant\nmarried her third husband, also a native born U.S. citizen, in August 2001. He adopted\nher son in October 2002 (A.E. B). Her son acquired U.S. citizenship with the adoption.\nApplicant and her husband own their own home\u2014valued at $630,000\u2014and fully paid\nfor. She has a company retirement account worth $65,000, and a U.S.-made will. She is\nactive in the main-line- protestant church she attends with her husband. She votes in\nU.S. elections. She donates blood. She has no financial or other interests in Russia.\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2003. At the time of her\nnaturalization, she possessed the valid foreign passport required of legal permanent\nresidents (LPR) by U.S. immigration law. That passport was a renewal she obtained in\nAugust 2000. After becoming a U.S. citizen, she explored the requirements for\nrenouncing her Russian citizenship through the website maintained by the Russian\nEmbassy, and discovered that the paperwork requirements\u2014including some she could\nonly obtain by traveling back to Russia\u2014were so onerous that she decided not to\npursue the issue further. Her Russian passport expired in August 2005.    \nApplicant fully disclosed her foreign connections in her December 2005 (G.E. 1)\nand September 2006 (G.E. 2) clearance applications, as well as during her December\n2006 subject interview. Sometime in 2006, Applicant applied for a new Russian\npassport, which she received in September 2006. She used the married name that she\nused to emigrate from Russia, as that is the only name Russia would recognize her by.\nThe passport is valid until September 2011. She has never used the passport to travel\n(A.E. B). She obtained the passport solely as a required identity document for her to\naccomplish certain legal actions under Russian law, including renunciation of her\nRussian citizenship.\nUnder Russian law, its citizens are identified by name to the property where they\nresided in Russia, and an annual fee is charged for each name attached to the\n\n3\nresidence\u2014regardless of whether that person still lives at that address. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother was paying the fee where Applicant and her parents lived, but the annual fee\nkept increasing. Applicant sought to have her name removed from address. In exploring\nthe requirements for accomplishing that action, she learned that she could give her\nbrother a power-of-attorney rather than return to Russia, but that she would have to\nprovide proof of Russian citizenship in order to execute a legally-effective document at\nthe Russian Embassy. At the same time, her December 2005 clearance application had\nsuggested to her that her dual citizenship might have adverse clearance implications.\nResearching the requirements for renouncing her Russian citizenship on the Russian\nEmbassy website (A.E. R), she learned that not only would she have to have a valid\nRussian passport to renounce her Russian citizenship, she would have to prove her\nentitlement to reside in the U.S., either with a passport or permanent residence card.\nHowever, she also learned that many of the documents required to originate in Russia\ncould now be obtained by her brother with a valid power-or-attorney.\nWhen Applicant obtained her Russian passport in September 2006, she began\nthe process of renouncing her Russian citizenship and having her named removed from\nher former residence in Russia. The process proved every bit as onerous as she\nthought it would be in 2003, when she first decided not to pursue it. However, after\nseveral false starts and additional, previously undisclosed, document requirements,\nApplicant succeeded in getting her name off the Russian residence, and finally\nsubmitted her renunciation paperwork to the Russian Embassy in December 2007 (A.E.\nM). The announced processing time is four months. In the meantime, Applicant\u2019s facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) holds her Russian passport because she cannot surrender it to\nthe Russian Embassy until her renunciation is approved, at which point the embassy will\ntake possession and destroy it.\nApplicant first learned that her clearance concerns were well-founded when she\nreceived interrogatories from DOHA in July 2007 (G.E. 3). In her July 2007 response,\nher FSO (at her previous employer) stated that the Russian passport had been\nsurrendered to him and his office was assuming responsibility for holding it. He also\nindicated he was aware of his obligation to notify DOHA if the passport was returned to\nApplicant. This FSO retained the passport until it was retrieved by the assistant FSO at\nApplicant\u2019s current employer and transferred to the current FSO. The passport has\nremained in the FSO\u2019s possession continually except when\u2014acting on instructions\ngiven to her by DOHA\u2014she gave the passport to Applicant for a brief period when\nApplicant was required to produce the passport at the Russian Embassy. Applicant later\nreturned the passport to the FSO.\nApplicant\u2019s parents immigrated to the U.S. in 1998, and live about an hour from\nApplicant and her husband. She sees them at least monthly. Her father is a newly-\nminted U.S. citizen\u2014December 2007 (A.E. O). Her mother is a legal permanent\nresident (LRP) of the U.S., applied for her U.S. citizenship in December 2006 (A.E. P),\nand is awaiting her interview. Applicant\u2019s aunt, an accountant for a bank, lives in\nUkraine. Applicant last saw her in 2004, but otherwise has no contact with her.\nApplicant went to Ukraine in 2004, because she was on a family vacation in Hungary,\n\n4\nand took her husband and son to Ukraine to show them where she spent summers with\nher grandmother growing up. She used her U.S. passport to travel to Hungary and\nUkraine (A.E. L). Applicant\u2019s brother lives in Russia. He manages a consumer\nelectronics store for a French company operating in Russia. Ordinarily, Applicant only\nhas contact with him on special occasions, like his birthday or New Year\u2019s, but contact\nhas been much more frequent over the last year as he has served as her middleman\nobtaining the Russian documents she required to renounce her Russian citizenship. In\n2000, when she was not yet a U.S. citizen, she traveled to Russia for his wedding.\nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses, who include her FSO, friends, neighbors, and\nher husband, extol her honesty and trustworthiness. Her FSO, who is also a co-owner\nof the company, corroborates many details of Applicant\u2019s efforts to renounce her\nRussian citizenship, including the instructions she received from DOHA to allow\nApplicant to take her passport to the Russian Embassy to process her renunciation. She\nalso notes that the government agency where Applicant works is so pleased with her\nwork there that they happily provide the escort required because Applicant does not\nhave a clearance. Applicant\u2019s former supervisor (A.E. A) is similarly laudatory about her\nwork and trustworthiness. She received excellent evaluations at two former employers\n(A.E. H, I).\nRussia\u2014a former Soviet Republic\u2014is a nominal democracy with a mixed human\nrights record. It has been the target of terrorist activity in recent years. Russian federal\nforces pursuing terrorists act with impunity while engaging in torture, summary\nexecutions, disappearances, and arbitrary detentions. Additional problems include\ncorruption, media suppression, life-threatening prison conditions, and corruption in law\nenforcement.\nRussia imposes rigid visa requirements on foreign travelers entering, and\ntraveling within, Russia. U.S. citizens who have at one time held Russian citizenship\nmay be required to renounce Russian citizenship before applying for a Russian visa in\ntheir U.S. passport. Unless a Russian citizen has formally renounced his or her Russian\ncitizenship, he or she risks being considered a Russian citizen and not allowed to depart\nexcept on a Russian passport.\nRussia has an active, significant, recent, and ongoing collecting program\nfocusing on the U.S. As of 2005, Russia was one of the two most aggressive collectors\nof sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounted for much of such targeting.\nHowever, Russia is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information.\nFurthermore, the U.S. and Russia cooperate over a broad spectrum of foreign-policy\nissues, particularly counter-terrorism efforts.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n4\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen;\n5\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline C.\nFirst, on the facts of this case, there is no conceivable way Applicant\u2019s using her\nmarried Russian name, the only name known to Russia when she left the country, to\nobtain her Russian passport in September 2006, could be an independent\ndemonstration of foreign preference (SOR 1.c.). Second, the government takes the\nposition that actions taken to renounce citizenship should be viewed as a disqualifying\nexercise of foreign preference. By the plain language of Guideline C, Applicant\u2019s\nactions, which meet the nominal requirements of \u00b610,  could raise security concerns\n4\nand might be disqualifying. Her actions are not required to be so viewed, and on the\nfacts of this case clearly cannot reasonably be so viewed. Put another way, if Applicant\nhad acted on her desire to renounce her Russian citizenship when she first looked into\nthe issue in October 2003, while her U.S.-required Russian passport was still valid,\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n5\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n6\n\u00b6 11.(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n7\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11.(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n8\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n9\ninvalidated; \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n10\n6\nthere would be no Guideline C allegations. However, even were I to find that the\ngovernment established security concerns, I conclude that she mitigated the Guideline\nC security concerns.\n \nAs posed by the government, I would have to find that her dual citizenship is not\nbased solely on her parents\u2019 citizenship, but is based on her active exercise of dual\ncitizenship after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  However, she not only expressed\n5\na willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship, she took active and difficult steps to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship, all while avoiding having to return to Russia.  While all\n6\nexercise of dual citizenship occurred after she obtained U.S. citizenship, as an adult,7\nthe only use to which she put her Russian passport was tacitly sanctioned by DOHA.8\nDOHA instructed Applicant\u2019s FSO to let Applicant take the passport to the Russian\nEmbassy to process her paperwork. Further, she not only stated willingness to\ninvalidate her passport, she surrender it to her FSO as soon as she was aware it was\nan issue, and waits only approval of her renunciation to return it to the embassy for\ndestruction.  Her actions have been a consistent effort to remove any possible means of\n9\nforeign influence. I resolve Guideline C for Applicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected\n10\ninformation requires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and\nability to target protected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to\nobtain that information, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative\nor positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or\nother foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n11\n7\nheightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.11\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. Considering first the country involved, Russia and the U.S. enjoy\ncompetitive foreign relations, although they cooperate on a wide variety of issues. While\nRussia is actively engaged in the collection of U.S. information, or there is no evidence\nsuggesting that it targets its expatriate citizens such that would make Applicant or her\nfamily members likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of her family contacts. Applicant\u2019s foreign travel to\nRussia in 2000 and Ukraine in 2004 have no independent security significance. Her\nparents were effectively a non-issue since 1998, even more so now that her father is a\nU.S. citizen and her mother is well on her way to U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s aunt has\nno connection to the Ukranian government, and Applicant has virtually no contact with\nher. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s brother has no connection to the Russian government.\nDepartment Counsel has articulated no sensible reason I should consider either as a\npotential source of influence on Applicant. I conclude that it is unlikely she can be\npressured based on her contacts with her brother. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B for\nApplicant.\nThe government requested that I find for Applicant under Guideline E. I granted\nthe request.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

It is undergoing\nprofound political and economic change as it moves toward a market economy and\nmultiparty democracy. After the first free elections in December 1991, presidential\nelections were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud. Subsequent\nparliamentary and local elections in 2006 and 2007 were in line with international\nstandards.\nUkraine has significant human rights problems. Even though prohibited by law,\nthere have been instances of torture, arbitrary detention of persons critical of the\ngovernment, and warrantless violations of privacy. Ukraine inherited a military force of\n780,000 from the Soviet Union, and seeks to modernize to achieve NATO standards.\nUkraine participates in six United Nations peacekeeping missions and has a small\nnumber of troops serving in supporting roles with coalition forces in Iraq. Ukraine is the\nonly non-NATO country supporting every NATO mission. Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy goals\ninclude membership in the World Trade Organization, the European Union, and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nUkraine has peaceful and constructive relations with its neighbors. Relations with\nRussia are difficult and complex, however, due to differing foreign policy priorities in the\nregion, energy dependence, payment arrears, disagreement over stationing of Russian\nmilitary forces, and some boundary disputes. The United States strongly supported\nUkraine\u2019s request to join NATO. Russia opposes Ukraine\u2019s entry into NATO. However,\nNATO allies have stated that Ukraine will eventually become a member of the alliance.\nScientists from Ukraine are among the most frequent visitors to Department of\nEnergy (DOE) facilities in the U.S., which is attributable to the fact that Ukraine was the\nsite of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and that Ukraine currently maintains 15 electricity-\nproducing nuclear power plants. Ukraine is not otherwise on the list of active collectors\nof sensitive and protected U.S. technology. Furthermore, the record does not indicate if\nUkraine targets U.S. citizens through family members residing in Ukraine to obtain\nprotected information.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness to protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable\ndoubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information (my emphasis) and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for\n3\naccess to protected information requires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nwillingness and ability to target protected information, and to target expatriates who are\nU.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence,\nwhether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign\nfamily members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.4\nIn this case, the Appeal Board directed me to find that the government\nestablished a case for disqualification under Guideline B, and I so find. However, the\nAppeal Board did so in part by considering events (the Russian incursion into the former\nSoviet Republic of Georgia in August 2008) that not only occurred after the record in\nthis case closed, but after the decision was issued. The Appeal Board also emphasized\nthe language above that the identity of the country matters\u2014while dispensing with a\nconsideration of the highlighted language above. However, considering the country\ninvolved, Russia and the U.S. enjoy competitive foreign relations, although they\ncooperate on a wide variety of issues. While Russia is actively engaged in the collection\nof U.S. information, there is still no evidence suggesting that it targets its expatriate\ncitizens such that would make Applicant or her family members likely targets for\ncoercion, duress, or influence. However, for the sake of this analysis, I will assume that\nit does.\nThe Appeal Board also directed me to engage in a current and accurate\nassessment of the \u201cgeopolitical situation\u201d and the \u201csecurity/intelligence profile\u201d of Russia\nvis-a-vis the U.S. It is axiomatic that such assessments are essential in a Guideline B\ncase, but as the Appeal Board infers, such assessments are necessarily fluid. Yet, if I\ntake the Appeal Board decision to its logical conclusion, I should be scanning today\u2019s\nheadlines for evidence of dramatic geopolitical shifts or taking into consideration the\npossibility that upcoming elections in Ukraine will transfer power from the current pro-\nWestern government seeking greater integration with European economies and politics\nto a pro-Russia government that can be expected to pursue closer alignment with\nRussia. Fortunately, this case can be resolved without such speculation.\nDespite a softening of relations with Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet\nUnion, and greater collaboration on some issues in the wake of 9/11, Russian\ngeopolitical imperatives remain largely unchanged from those of the Soviet Union,\npossibly even from those of Czarist Russia. Two of the most important geopolitical goals\nhave been obtaining and maintaining access to a warm-water port on the Black Sea\nand\u2014because of the absence of natural defensive barriers on the Russian\nplain\u2014maintenance of a sphere of influence in neighboring states, whether through\nallied Soviet Republics or buffer states sympathetic to Russian interests.\nThe Russian incursion into Georgia established that which is not seriously in\ncontention: that Russia will act with armed force when it perceives that such force is\n\n5\nnecessary to protect its interests. Russia did so in Hungary and then-Czechoslovakia\nwhen it was part of the Soviet Union. It is no great surprise that it did so in Georgia. It\nwould not be a great surprise if it did so in Ukraine or any of the other former Soviet\nRepublics that have tried to establish closer ties with the West. The only real difference\nis that, in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia lacked\nboth the political cohesiveness and the military power to pursue those geopolitical goals.\nRussia lacks them no more. Thus, Russia may be expected to move to pull its former\nrepublics back into its orbit, whether by peaceful means (supporting pro-Russia\ncandidates in Ukraine), aggressive economic actions (cutting natural gas transmission\nto Ukraine), or military force.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, I find\u2014in accord with the Appeal Board\u2019s\nruling\u2014that the government established that there was a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of her family\ncontacts with her brother in Russia, but not with her aunt in Ukraine. Ukraine is not in\nthe same category as Russia regarding acquisition of protected U.S. information.\nHowever, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s foreign travel to Russia\nin 2000 and Ukraine in 2004 have no independent security significance. Her parents\nhave effectively been a non-issue since 1998, when they immigrated to the U.S., and\neven more so now that both her parents, who still live in the U.S., are U.S. citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s aunt has no connection to the Ukranian government, and Applicant has\nvirtually no contact with her. \nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s brother has no connection to the Russian government.\nApplicant has sponsored him and his wife to immigrate to the U.S. She had more\nfrequent contact with him during the time she gave him power-of-attorney to remove her\nname from residence records in Russia and obtain the documents she needed to\nrenounce her Russian citizenship. However, her contacts have returned to the less-\nfrequent levels she had since she came to the U.S. Department Counsel has articulated\nno reasonable argument I should consider either her aunt or her brother as a potential\nsource of influence on Applicant. I conclude that it is unlikely she can be pressured\nbased on her contacts with her aunt or her brother. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B\nfor Applicant. Consideration of the nine \u201cwhole person\u201d factors lead to the same result.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 2.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nNovember 12, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 24, 2006\n(Government Exhibit 1). On March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed security\nconcerns under Guideline B stating why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 14, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 24, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\n\n2\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 9, 2008,\nand I received the case assignment on May 19, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non June 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 26, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A,\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 8, 2008. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 11, 2008, to submit\nadditional matters.  On July 11, 2008, she submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, without\nobjection. The record closed on July 11, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request dated May 9, 2008, that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to the Kingdom of Thailand. (Transcript at\n13-14, 22-24.) The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 55, married, and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  She is employed by\na defense related company and seeks a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment in the defense industry.  In her Answer to the SOR, dated March 24, 2008,\nApplicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations of the SOR, with explanations.\nShe also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.  She denied subparagraph 1.d., in that this brother in law (the\nbrother of her husband) has passed away.  (Transcript at 26, 38-39, 52-54.)  That\nsubparagraph is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the\nexercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant was born in Thailand in 1951.  She emigrated to the United States\nin 1973.  The Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in August 1996.  Her\ncurrent husband was also born in Thailand.  He is a Permanent Resident Alien in the\nUnited States.  They were married in 1979, and have two children.  Both of the\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in support of\n1\nher request for administrative notice.  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s children were born in the United States.  The Applicant and her husband\nhave over $200,000 in assets in the United States.  (Transcript at 57-58, 60-61.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother, who is an American citizen, lives in the United States\nwith her.  Her father lives in Thailand, where he is looked after by the Applicant\u2019s sole\nsibling, a sister.  The latter are both Thai citizens.  This year the Applicant\u2019s sister\nloaned about $20,000 to the Applicant, so that she could pay bills and give some money\nto one of her sons for his start up company.  The total amount the Applicant used to pay\nher bills was approximately $6,000.  (Transcript at 62-63, 66-67.)\nThe Applicant has substantial property interests in Thailand.  With her sister, she\nowns a substantial piece of property, worth about $2,000,000 if it was sold.  This\nproperty was given to the Applicant and her sister by their mother about six years ago.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 7.)  It is on an island with the potential to be developed.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The Applicant has plans to create a retirement community on\nthe property.  The Applicant\u2019s mother has requested that the property not be sold during\nher lifetime, and the Applicant intends to fulfill that promise.  Once she retires, the\nApplicant plans on living in Thailand four months out of the year.  (Transcript at 26-29,\n32-34, 44.)  \nThe Applicant discussed the corruption present in Thailand and how it affected\nher family.  In particular, she testified about how her family has had to fight to retain\ntheir coconut plantation, when others wanted to take it.  (Transcript at 57, 59-60.)\nIn addition, the Applicant owns a seven unit apartment building in Thailand.  She\nuses the income from that building to take care of her father, who lives in one of the\nunits.  The Applicant travels to Thailand on an annual basis to visit her elderly father, as\nwell as her sister.  (Transcript at 28, 48-49.)   \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law have passed away.  As stated\nearlier, her husband\u2019s brother who was the subject of subparagraph 1.d. passed away\nabout two years ago.  Neither the Applicant or her husband have a relationship of any\ntype with the remainder of his family, a brother and sister.  (Transcript at 38-39, 45-46.) \nDuring her testimony, the Applicant expressed considerable concern about the\nmilitary coup that toppled the elected civilian government in Thailand in 2006.\n(Transcript at 34.)  The coup, and other pertinent matters involving Thailand, will be\ndiscussed immediately below.\nThe Applicant has many contacts with Thailand.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to\ndiscuss the situation in Thailand at this time.   The Kingdom of Thailand is a\n1\nconstitutional monarchy.  The current ruler is treated with deep reverence and respect.\nOn September 19, 2006, the current ruling regime came to power through a bloodless\n\n4\ncoup, whereby military leaders overthrew the democratically elected Prime Minister.\nThe coup leaders, now called the Council for National Security, assert that the Prime\nMinister was corrupt and that the last election was fraudulent.  In the following months\nthey abolished Parliament, declared martial law, and issued decrees limiting civil\nliberties including limits on free speech, free press and freedom of assembly.\nThailand has a free-enterprise economy with a well-developed infrastructure, and\npro-investment policies.  Approximately 40% of Thailand\u2019s labor force is agricultural,\nwith rice being the most important crop.  It also has an increasingly diversified\nmanufacturing sector.  The United States is Thailand\u2019s largest export market and\nsecond largest supplier.\nIn the past, Thailand had excellent military relations with the United States,\nincluding joint training and maneuvers.  In addition, Thailand cooperated with the United\nStates on a wide variety of foreign policy issues, including the Global War on Terror.\nHowever, as a result of the military coup in September 2006, the United States\nsuspended Foreign Military Financing, International Military Training funds, and peace-\nkeeping operation funds with Thailand.\nThe United States Government, through the State Department, has criticized the\nThai government\u2019s overall human rights record for several years.  Prior to the coup, the\nThai constitution prohibited such practices as torture and arbitrary arrest and detention.\nHowever, instances of disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions have\nbeen reported under past and present Thai regimes.  The Emergency Decree and\nmartial law orders in effect since the coup permit authorities to conduct searches\nwithout a warrant.  Further, despite constitutional protections afforded to freedom of\nspeech and the press, the coup leaders have suspended these rights and have banned\narticles, messages, speeches and any other type of discourse that could undermine the\ncoup.\nFinally, Thailand\u2019s southern provinces continue to be the source of sectarian\nviolence between Muslim insurgents and Thai security forces.  While the extremist\ngroups primarily focus on Thai government interests in the south, recent violence has\nalso targeted public places, including tourist areas.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors\nwhich must be given \"binding\" consideration in making security clearance\ndeterminations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the\npertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the\ndecision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his\nown common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways\nof the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case\n\n5\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these\nfactors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based\non the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of\nthis case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS, below.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should\nconsider the following factors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or\nduress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \"clearly consistent with the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request\nfor access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may have foreign\ncontacts and interests that may lead to poor judgement, untrustworthiness or\nunreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information,\nboth favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness,\n\n6\nrecency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which\nconduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the\ncircumstances or consequences involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated,\nthe probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future.\"  The Administrative\nJudge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this\norder...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be\na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has foreign connections which could cause a security\nconcern (Guideline B).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not successfully mitigated the\nGovernment's case, except in part.  Subparagraph 1.d. is found for the Applicant as her\nhusband\u2019s brother has passed away.\nThe Applicant has many and varied connections to Thailand.  The Applicant\u2019s\nfather and sister continue to live in Thailand, and the Applicant has a close and\ncontinuing association with them.  In addition, the Applicant has substantial financial\ninterests in Thailand.  The Applicant emphasizes, and it is true, that the family plantation\ncurrently has potential value of approximately $2,000,000.  The fact remains that the\npotential value of her half is almost five times the value of her assets in the United\nStates.  In addition, just this year, her sister in Thailand had to lend the Applicant\n$20,000 so that she could make credit card payments.  Finally, the Applicant\u2019s family\nhas already had to fight political corruption in Thailand to retain their rights to this\nobviously desirable piece of property.\nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the current Thai\ngovernment, and its strained relations with the United States after the coup.  The\nApplicant is obviously not a supporter of the coup.  The Applicant repeatedly stated that\nshe is a loyal American citizen, and that she understands her responsibilities as a\nsecurity clearance holder.  However, given the depth and extent of her current\n\n7\nconnections with Thailand, she has failed to meet her burden of showing an unequivocal\nconnection to the United States.  She is not eligible for a security clearance at the\npresent time.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; and (e) a\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  I have also considered the\ninformation concerning the current Thai government, which came to power through a\nmilitary coup, provided by Department Counsel and attached to the record. \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given er particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest and (f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual .\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Two of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case.  First, I cannot find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nThe Applicant simply has not proved that she has sufficient connections in this country,\nwhich shows a preference for the United States instead of Thailand.  \nMore importantly, as stated at length above, the Applicant\u2019s primary financial\ninterest is in family property in Thailand. Given the current situation in Thailand, along\nwith the history of attempts by corrupt interests in the Thai government to wrongfully\nacquire the property, it is not possible for me to find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames P. Fleisher, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 28, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected\nInformation) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.\n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 12, 2008, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant had deliberately falsified his security clearance application; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision under Guidelines K and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings:  Applicant is 58 years old, married with\nthree adult children, and is a retired military officer with 24 years of active service.  He has a\nmaster\u2019s degree. Since his retirement in 1994, he has worked for several defense contractors.  While\nin the military, Applicant had a security clearance and never had any incidents or problems with the\nclearance.  During his career, Applicant completed several security clearance applications.  A former\nsupervisor evaluates Applicant as a dependable and conscientious employeewho always delivered\na quality product for him.  Decision at 2.\nFrom May 2004 to February 2006, Applicant failed to properly secure classified information\nat his place of work on six occasions.  No loss or compromise of classified information occurred as\na result of those incidents.  After the incidents, he attended additional training regarding security\nprocedures.  Id.\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended in February 2005, and restored\nin March 2005.  Applicant submitted a written response to the suspension.  He stated he did not\ndeliberately disregard procedures, and offered his version of the incidents up to the suspension.\nApplicant also admitted he had no explanation for the security violations, but he thought he fully\nperformed the security procedures.  Id. at 3. \nApplicant\u2019s employer removed him in April 2006, after the sixth incident involving\nviolations of security procedures.  The employer found all prior incidents were of a similar nature,\nand that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] repeated failure to comply with statutory requirements to protect classified\ninformation by following established processes and procedures is well documented.\u201d  Applicant was\nremoved \u201cto prevent future incidents and potential compromise of classified information.\u201d \nApplicant resigned from that job in May 2006.  He obtained employment with another defense\ncontractor in a test evaluation position in May 2007.  Id. \nIn August 2007, Applicant offered a new explanation for his security lapses from 2004 to\n2006.  Applicant explained in this response to the DOHA interrogatories, and again at the hearing,\nthat his younger sister died unexpectedly in February 2004. He was the estate executor, and had to\nspend three weeks working at her home to organize her possessions to settle the estate.  Applicant\u2019s\nwife described him as tired during that period, and not sleeping well.  Applicant described himself\nas numb over her death, but he had no breakdowns at work because he compartmentalized his life\nand focused on his work.  He obtained no counseling during 2004, nor when his father-in-law was\n\n3\nill and died in the period of January to May 2006. Applicant considered his work performance from\n2004 to 2006 to be high.  Applicant had a physical examination in November 2007, and in December\n2007, an evaluation by a clinical neuropsychologist.  The tests results were normal.  One test\nindicated some increasing stress, situational distress, and \u201csome underlying depression and anxiety,\u201d\nbut nopsychotherapeutic intervention was deemed warranted, \u201cas the situational distresses have\ndissipated.\u201d  Id. at 4.\nApplicant completed his security clearance application on April 6, 2006.  Question 26(b) of\nthe application asked: \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access authorization\ndenied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government employment?\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d even though he had his access suspended from February 2005, to March\n2005.  He stated that he did not disclose the access suspension because he interpreted the question\nto apply only to his security clearance, which remained in effect.  Id.\n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify Question 26(b) of his security\nclearance application by failing to disclose the fact that his access to classified information had been\nsuspended.  In support of that argument, he asserts that the Judge was required to accept, as a matter\nof law, his explanation that he had misinterpreted the question.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that he considered Applicant\u2019s explanation for\nwhy he failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law,\nto accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light\nof the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s\nomission was deliberate and intentional.  Given the plain language of the question at issue,\nApplicant\u2019s prior experience completing security clearance applications, and the totality of the record\nevidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had deliberately falsified his security clearance\napplication is sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02163 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2008); ISCR\nCase No. 06-16159 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2008).\n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law because the Judge failed to examine relevant evidence and factors, failed to consider\nan important aspect of the case, and failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\nincluding a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.  Additionally, he also\nargues that the Judge reached an overall decision that ran contrary to the record evidence and\nreflected a clear error in judgment.  The Board does not find these arguments persuasive.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\n\n4\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nApplicant specifically challenges the Judge\u2019s application of Guideline E in this case.\nHowever, the Board has previously addressed the interpretation of Guideline E proffered by\nApplicant.  In ISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008), the Board declined to read\nparagraph 16 as limiting the scope of paragraph 15 or Enclosure 2, paragraph 2(d).  Applicant\u2019s\nargument has not persuaded us to alter our view.\nThe Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  He is not\nrequired to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  The Judge\u2019s decision is not measured against a standard of perfection.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-01009 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 2005).  A review of the record indicates that\nthe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness\nof the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 4, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on October 12, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 15, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 30, 2007, and I received\nthe case assignment on December 13, 2007.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nMarch 12, 2008\n\n2\nDecember 18, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 9, 2008.\nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 8, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 25, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 15, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h. of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b. of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 58 years old, married with three adult children, and is a retired\nmilitary officer with 24 years of active service.  He has a master\u2019s degree.  Since his\nretirement in 1994, he has worked for several defense contractors.  While in the military,\nApplicant had a security clearance and never had any incidents or problems with the\nclearance. During his career, Applicant completed several security clearance\napplications (SCS). A former supervisor evaluates Applicant as dependable and\nconscientious who always delivered a quality product for him. (Tr. 13-22, 49, 35, 55, 69,\n80, 81; Exhibits 1 and A)\nDuring a period of time from May 6, 2004, until February 27, 2006, Applicant\nperpetrated six incidents of failing to properly secure classified information in his work\nplace.  As a result of these incidents, no loss or compromise of classified information\noccurred.  The safe, computer, and printer involved in the incidents were in a lockable\nroom with a steel door and a swipe card mechanism, located amidst many work\ncubicles. After the incidents, he attended additional training regarding security\nprocedures.  The incidents were as follows:\n(1) May 6, 2004, when Applicant printed a classified document and left it in\nthe printer tray while he stepped outside the secured room to find a co-worker who\nneeded to review the document. Another employee entered the secured room and\nfound the classified document in the printer.  Applicant was only gone a few minutes.  At\nthe end of the work day, Applicant closed the safe drawer, spun the combination lock\ndial, and pushed the handle to ensure it would not open. He signed the security\nchecklist form and was the last person to do so that day.  \n(2) On May 7, 2004, another employee entered the secure room at the\nstart of the work day and found the safe handle moved. She could open the safe by\npressing on the drawer handle.  \n(3) On June 8, 2004, Applicant failed to secure the same safe.  He spun\nthe dial after closing the drawer, and pulled on the handle. Then he signed the security\n\n3\nchecklist. The next morning, June 9, 2004, Applicant entered the secure room and\nfound the safe drawer to be unlocked.  He reported it.\n(4) On July 13, 2004, the safe drawer was found to be unlocked by the\nperson performing the end of day security checks. This person reported the safe\nappeared to be closed and locked, but was not locked.  Applicant was the last person to\naccess the area and the safe prior to the discovery of the unlocked safe. Applicant\nstated he remembered closing the drawer, spinning the dial, and signing the security\nchecklist. He could not remember if he physically tugged on the drawer handle to\ndetermine if it were actually locked.\nThe safe was checked on September 27, 2004, and found to be working\nproperly. The locksmith advised the defense contractor the dial must be fully spun and\nthe handle depressed to make certain the safe is locked.\n(5) On January 12, 2005, an employee performing the end of day security\nchecks found the two drawer safe in the secure room unlocked.  The safe opened when\nshe pulled on the handle. Applicant was in the room previously that day to conduct his\nbusiness.  When completed, he closed the safe and spun the dial. When he should\nhave pulled on the drawer handle, he noticed the printer was still on.  He reached over\nto turn it off and check that no material, which should have been in the safe, was in the\nprinter.  Then he signed the security check list without testing the handle, and exited the\nroom. About an hour later, the end of day security check showed the safe was\nunlocked.\n(6) On February 27, 2006, Applicant was again in the secure room.  After\ncompleting his work, he failed to remove the hard drive from a classified computer, and\nplace it in the safe.  He did lock the safe properly. (Tr. 33-37, 43, 50, 54; Exhibits 2-5)\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended on February 25,\n2005, until restored on March 29, 2005.  Applicant submitted a written response to the\nsuspension.  He stated he did not deliberately disregard procedures, and offered his\nversion of the incidents up to the suspension.  Applicant admitted he had no explanation\nfor the security violations, but he thought he fully performed the security procedures. \n(Tr. 34, 54, 60; Exhibits 2, 4)\nApplicant\u2019s employer removed him on April 12, 2006, at his work site after the\nsixth incident involving violations of security procedures. The employer found all prior\nincidents were of a similar nature.  The employer found, \u201cHis repeated failure to comply\nwith statutory requirements to protect classified information by following established\nprocesses and procedures is well documented.\u201d He was removed \u201cto prevent future\nincidents and potential compromise of classified information.\u201d Applicant resigned from\nthat job in May 2006.  Applicant obtained employment with another defense contractor\nin a test evaluation position in May 2007. Applicant needs a security clearance to\nmaintain that position. (Tr. 48, 62, 81; Exhibits 2, 5) \n\n4\nOn August 20, 2007, Applicant offered a new explanation for his security lapses\nfrom 2004 to 2006.  Applicant explained in this response to the DOHA interrogatories,\nand again at the hearing, that his younger sister died unexpectedly in February 2004.\nHe was the estate executor, and had to spend three weeks working at her home to\norganize her possessions to settle the estate.  Applicant\u2019s wife described him as tired\nduring that period, and not sleeping well.  Applicant described himself as numb over her\ndeath, but he had no breakdowns at work because he compartmentalized his life and\nfocused on his work.  He obtained no counseling during 2004, nor when his father-in-\nlaw was ill and died in the period of January to May 2006.  Applicant considered his\nwork performance from 2004 to 2006 to be high.  Applicant had a physical examination\nin November 2007, and on December 31, 2007, evaluation by a clinical\nneuropsychologist.  The tests results were normal.  One test indicated some increasing\nstress, situational distress, and \u201csome underlying depression and anxiety.\u201d  No\npsychotherapeutic intervention was deemed warranted, \u201cas the situational distresses\nhave dissipated.\u201d (Tr. 25-32, 35, 50, 53, 63, 68-77; Exhibit B)\nThe National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), dated\nJanuary 1995 and as amended through 2004, DoD 5220-22-M, governs the security\nprocedures pertaining to the storage and physical protection of classified information in\nthe custody of contractors.  It describes the types of safes to be used, and the security\nresponsibilities for automated information systems. Applicant\u2019s actions violated\nParagraphs 5-100, 5-300, 5-303, 8-100, and 8-105. (Exhibits 6-8)\nApplicant completed his latest SCA on April 6, 2006.  He started completing the\nform in February 2006.  An employee of his employer physically wrote his answers into\nthe last copy of the SCA.  Applicant reviewed it and signed it.  When he signed the\nSCA, he certified, as it states in the signature block, that \u201cMy statements on this form,\nand any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge\nand belief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false\nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.\u201d   Applicant\nanswered Question 26(b), \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or\naccess authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred\nfrom government employment?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d even though he had his\naccess suspended from February 25, 2005, to March 29, 2005.  He did not disclose the\naccess suspension because he interpreted the question to apply only to his security\nclearance, which remained in effect. (Tr. 38-46, 55-61, 67; Exhibit 1)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information\nThe security concern for Guideline K is set forth in AG \u00b6 33 and states as follows:\n\u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability\nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d\nThe guideline notes two disqualifying conditions that could raise security\nconcerns under these facts: (1) AG &34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with the rules for the\nprotection of classified or other sensitive information,\u201d and, (2) AG \u00b634(h), \u201cnegligence\nor lax security habits that persist despite counseling by management.\u201d  The evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s six incidents of failing to lock the safe, remove classified information from a\nprinter, and secure a classified hard drive in the safe shows these disqualifying\nconditions are clearly applicable. Applicant was retrained by management after the\nincidents. His access was suspended for a month in 2005, yet one more incident\noccurred in 2006. Then, management finally removed his access to classified\ninformation in 2006.  Applicant could not credibly explain how the lapses in security\nprocedures occurred.  It was only in 2007 that he offered the reason that his grief over\nhis sister\u2019s unexpected death may have caused him to forget to press on the safe\nhandle as part of the locking procedure.\nThe guideline also includes three mitigating conditions that could be applicable\nhere. Under AG \u00b635(a), \u201cso much time as elapsed since the behavior, or it has\nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d might be applicable on the passage of time element alone.  Therefore,\nthe latest incident was only two years ago, occurring after a suspension and several\nretraining sessions.  The incidents did not happen infrequently, nor under unusual\ncircumstances.  The passage of time is insufficient to overcome the pattern of\nnegligence exhibited by Applicant.\nNor are his present explanations for the incidents persuasive.  It does not take\nmuch attention to duty and security requirements to spin a dial on a safe and pull on a\nsafe handle at the end of a day to make certain the safe is locked.  Repeatedly,\nApplicant could not do that.  Finally, leaving a classified hard drive in a computer at the\nend of the work day is a more serious breach of security requirements.  The mitigating\ncondition does not overcome the two disqualifying conditions under these facts.\nThe other two possible mitigating conditions are not applicable.  First, because\nApplicant did not respond favorably to his security retraining as shown by his\nsubsequent failures to lock the safe.  Second, as a well-trained military officer who had\na clearance for 35 years and security training through out that time, there was certainly\nnot any improper or inadequate training causing his several security failures. \n\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under Guideline E is set forth in AG \u00b615 and is stated as\nfollows:\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d\nThe Government\u2019s concern here is two-fold.  First, that the pattern of security\nbreaches by Applicant in 2004 to 2006 demonstrate questionable judgment and an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about Applicant\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  Second, the\nGovernment is concerned about Applicant\u2019s failure to answer Question 26(b) truthfully\nwhen he denied he had ever had his access authorization denied, suspended or\nrevoked.\nThe three disqualifying conditions under this guideline which apply are:  \u00b616(a),\n\u201cinvolving deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct \ninvestigations, \ndetermine \nemployment \nqualifications, \nor \ndetermine\ntrustworthiness,\u201d \u00b616(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue\nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not safeguard protected information,\u201d and \u00b616(d), \u201ccredible adverse information\nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself\nfor an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\nThis includes but is not limited to consideration of (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations.\u201d  \nApplicant committed each of the breaches of security regulations, responded to\nthem as each was investigated by his employer,  admitted he knew he had been\nsuspended from access in 2005 for one month.  He claimed his latest security  violation\nwas under investigation in April 2006 when he signed the SCA and that he had a\nsecurity clearance at that time, but Question 26 was also clearly directed toward the\naccess suspension occurring for one month in 2005.  Applicant had a pattern of security\n\n8\nrule violations in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  These disqualifying conditions clearly meet the\nfacts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s actions.\nThe mitigating conditions under this guideline are several, all involving efforts\nmade by any Applicant to acknowledge and correct their behavior.  Examining each of\nthem, I concluded that none apply to Applicant under the facts of this case. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated retired military officer, who for some unknown reasons could not lock a safe\ncontaining classified information on repeated occasions. These failures are serious\nerrors in the requirements to protect classified information.  His behavior did not change\nover a two-year period.  His employer finally revoked his access in 2006 because it\ncould no longer trust him to comply with the security requirements. Based on the\nevidence of his actions, the employer\u2019s action was prudent because there is a likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence of such security breaches.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his conduct in handling of\nprotected information, and his failure to disclose to the Government on his 2006 SCA\nhis access suspension in 2005.  Therefore, I conclude the Guideline K, Guideline E, and\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His passport had not\nbeen destroyed or rendered unusable or otherwise invalid.  Neither had it been surrendered to a\n\u201ccognizant security authority.\u201d  The passport was in the possession of Applicant\u2019s own attorney. \nThe record will not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns\narising out of his possession of a foreign passport, and the Judge\u2019s holding to the contrary is\nerror.  Applicant\u2019s failure to mitigate appears to be, in part, a result of his compliance with\ninstructions by the Judge, with the apparent concurrence of Department Counsel.  Under the\ncircumstances, the Board concludes that the best corrective action is to remand the case to the\nJudge for a new decision.

Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 21, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 14, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Wilford H. Ross granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact were supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge erred in his\nwhole person analysis.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Germany.\nFrom 1985 until 2000 he was an officer in the German military.  Between 1995 and 1998 he served\nin the United States as part of an officer exchange program.  Applicant married an American citizen\nin 1997 and had a daughter.  However, they subsequently divorced.  Applicant\u2019s daughter and his\nex-wife live in the United States.\nAfter leaving the German military Applicant began working for a U.S. defense contractor.\nHe became a U.S. citizen in 2004.  He holds a U.S. passport.  He also has a German passport, which\nhe obtained in 2004 and which is valid until 2014.  Upon being advised about U.S. concerns over\nhis having dual citizenship, he \u201ctook steps to renounce his German citizenship . . . On February 20,\n2008, the Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted the Applicant\u2019s Application to Renounce German\nCitizenship to the German Consulate-General . . . Applicant\u2019s counsel took possession of the\nApplicant\u2019s German passport at the hearing in order to have it available to surrender to the German\nauthorities after the Certificate of Renunciation has been issued.  The passport cannot be\nsurrendered to the German authorities before that time.\u201d  Decision at 3.  (emphasis added)\n\n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel argued on appeal that the finding highlighted above is not supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  In making this finding, the Judge relied on a document submitted by\nApplicant, a copy of the form, in German with an English translation, whereby he expressed his\nintention to renounce his German citizenship.  The pertinent section of that document reads as\nfollows: \u201cI will turn in my German passport/ID document at the time of receipt of my Certificate of\nRenunciation.\u201d  Department Counsel stated, \u201c[A] reasonable reading of the record establishes only\nthat German authorities expected individuals who had renounced their German citizenship to\nsurrender their German passport (a benefit of German citizenship) upon finalization of citizenship\nrenunciation.  The German process, as established by the record, did not preclude surrender of the\npassport contemporaneously with renouncement of citizenship.\u201d  Brief at 10.  The Board has\nexamined the record and finds Department Counsel\u2019s position persuasive.  We find nothing in the\nrecord to support the view that Applicant\u2019s actual receipt of a certificate of renunciation from the\nGerman government was a condition precedent to his surrender of his passport.  The record does not\nsustain the challenged finding.   \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\n\n4\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDespite the implication of the Judge\u2019s challenged finding, there is no basis to conclude that\nApplicant was, in fact or in law, precluded from complying with the provisions of FCMC 11(e).\nThis provision mitigates the Foreign Preference security concerns arising from possession of a\nforeign passport, when \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated . . .\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.11(e).  At the end of the hearing, the Judge\nadvised Applicant\u2019s attorney \u201cto take possession of [Applicant\u2019s] passport and the [citizenship\nrenunciation] application . . . I notice that this application says that you\u2019re not really supposed to\nsurrender the passport to them until you get your certificate of renunciation . . . What I\u2019d like you to\ndo . . . is check with the German Consulate in Los Angeles, which I assume is where this goes . . .\n[a]nd see what they\u2019re willing to take.  If they\u2019ll take the passport now, do it.  Otherwise, I want you\nto take possession of it until such time as it is surrendered. [Applicant\u2019s Attorney]: I will do that,\nyour honor. [Department Counsel]: Your Honor, are you going to be leaving the record open for that\nentire period of time? [Judge]: . . .  Once he has possession of the passport, I don\u2019t think we have to\nworry about it . . . when are you going to send it in to Los Angeles?

Let\u2019s leave the record open until the end of next week for\ndocumentation and see how long this takes.\u201d  Tr. at 133 - 135.  Subsequently Applicant submitted\nExhibit N, a copy of the signed renunciation certificate, along with a letter from his attorney to the\nGerman consulate, advising that Applicant \u201cwill forward his German Passport to your office upon\nreceipt of the Certificate of Renunciation.\u201d  Exhibit N at 4.  \nIn her appeal brief, Department Counsel persuasively argued that, at the time of the close of\nthe record, Applicant had not satisfied the criteria set forth in FCMC 11(e), which are broad.  His\npassport had not been destroyed or rendered unusable or otherwise invalid.  Neither had it been\nsurrendered to a \u201ccognizant security authority.\u201d  The passport was in the possession of Applicant\u2019s\nown attorney, rather than surrendered to a person authorized to perform responsibilities pertinent to\nnational security.  The record before us will not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns arising out of his possession of a foreign passport, and the Judge\u2019s holding to\nthe contrary is error.  However, in this case, we note that Applicant\u2019s failure to mitigate appears to\n\n5\nbe, in part, a result of his compliance with instructions by the Judge, with the apparent concurrence\nof Department Counsel.  Under the circumstances, the Board concludes that the best corrective\naction is to remand the case to the Judge for a new decision.  On remand the Judge is permitted to\nreopen the record on the motion of either party to present any additional evidence they deem\nappropriate to resolve the issues identified herein. \n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMichael Coleman, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his use of marijuana, at times\nwhile he held a security clearance, and a February 2006 drug-related arrest. He also failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns raised by his failure to disclose his drug use and arrest during a July 2006\ninterview with a government investigator, and his failure to report his arrest to his employer as\nrequired. Clearance is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s most recent background investigation, adjudicators\nfor the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security\n1\nclearance. On August 13, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nfacts that raise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines under Guideline\nH (illegal drugs) and Guideline E (personal conduct).2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on October 22, 2007, and I convened a hearing on November 15, 2007, at which the parties\nappeared as scheduled. I admitted four exhibits proffered by the government (Gx. 1- 4). Applicant\ntestified, presented one witness, and offered one exhibit, which was admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(Ax.) A . On November 29, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged under Guideline H (illegal drugs) Applicant used marijuana from\n\u201cin at least about 1986 and October 2006\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was arrested on February 17, 2006,\nand charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, for which he performed 50 hours\nof community service and completed 10 weeks of pre-trial intervention drug counseling (SOR \u00b6 1.b);\nthat he attended said pre-trial intervention drug counseling between September 2006 and December\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that in October 2006, he tested positive for drugs during a urinalysis administered\nduring his pre-trial intervention counseling (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he used marijuana while holding\na security clearance he received in April 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nThe government further alleged under Guideline E (personal conduct) the Applicant failed\nto report  his February 2006 arrest as required by his employer (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he intentionally\nfailed to disclose his arrest when he was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2006, and\nonly disclosed his arrest during a second such interview in December 2006 when the government\ninvestigator confronted Applicant with the information about Applicant\u2019s arrest (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and\nthat Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance is also disqualifying under\nGuideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.c).\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted without explanation all of the allegations. His\nadmissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 38 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a production electronics\ntechnician, which involves assembly and installation of communications and data processing\n\n Gx. 1; Tr., 6 - 7, 44 - 45.\n3\n Gx. 4.\n4\n Tr., 44 - 45.\n5\n Gx. 3.\n6\n Gx. 2.\n7\n Tr., 33, lines 3 - 13.\n8\n Gx. 4.\n9\n3\nequipment racks aboard submarines and at shore facilities. Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force\nfrom 1989 until receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions as a senior airman\n(paygrade E-4) in 1995. In the Air Force, he performed similar duties (cable and equipment\ninstallation) in missile launch facilities. Applicant was granted a secret security clearance while he\nwas in the Air Force. He has held that clearance without interruption since January 1998.  It was\n3\nmost recently renewed in December 2005, most likely on an interim basis pending the outcome of\na background investigation that commenced when he submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) on December 21, 2005.  \n4\nAfter leaving the military, Applicant worked for two other defense contractors while holding\na security clearance performing similar work until late 2001. His clearance did not lapse while he\nwas either unemployed or worked in retail sales from November 2001 until he was hired by his\ncurrent employer in November 2002. He testified that he went to work immediately upon being hired\nby his current employer because his clearance was still active.5\nOn June 14, 2006, Applicant\u2019s employer submitted an Adverse Information Report, which\ninformed the Defense Security Service that Applicant had been arrested on February 6, 2006, and\ncharged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He claims he reported\nthe arrest to his immediate supervisor a day or two after it happened; however, as of June 2006, he\nhad not yet reported the incident to the security office as required by company policy. Applicant\nsigned a copy of that policy when he was hired.6\nIn July 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of his\nbackground investigation. The interview covered issues related to Applicant\u2019s finances, and he did\nnot disclose his arrest because the investigator did not ask him about it and because his attorney, who\nalso represented him at this hearing, advised him not to talk about the arrest.  His attorney, while\n7\nquestioning the Applicant in this matter, acknowledged he was not giving advice to Applicant about\nsecurity procedures.8\nA copy of the police report of the arrest revealed police found a bag of marijuana and several\nmarijuana cigarettes in Applicant\u2019s vehicle.  In December 2006, during a subsequent interview with\n9\na government investigator, Applicant discussed the arrest after the investigator asked him about the\n\n Gx. 2.\n10\n Gx. 2; Tr., 41 - 42.\n11\n Tr., 44.\n12\n Tr., 35 - 36.\n13\n Tr., 47 - 52.\n14\n Gx. 2; Tr., 28- 29; Ax. A.\n15\n Directive. 6.3.\n16\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness\n17\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\n4\nincident. In describing the arrest, Applicant stated that all the police found was the remains of a\nmarijuana cigarette and a pipe with marijuana residue in it.10\nIn the December 2006 interview, Applicant stated he used marijuana a few times in high\nschool, but had not used marijuana in more than 20 years. As a result of his arrest, he was assigned\nto pre-trial intervention, which required him to attend weekly drug counseling sessions from\nSeptember 2006 until December 2006. In October 2006, Applicant came up positive for marijuana\nafter a urinalysis test. During his interview and in his testimony, Applicant offered a \u201csecond hand\nsmoke\u201d theory to explain the test results, asserting he inhaled marijuana by hanging out with friends\nwho used it in his presence.  However, Applicant also testified he used marijuana the night he was\n11\narrested.  Applicant no longer associates with his friends who use marijuana.\n12\n13\nApplicant is a reliable worker. His former supervisor, who has worked closely with him for\nmost of the past five years, regards him as trustworthy and, despite knowledge of Applicant\u2019s arrest\nand drug use, recommends his security clearance should be renewed.  Applicant completed\n14\nsatisfactorily all of the terms of his pre-trial intervention. He performed 50 hours of community\nservice working at a local animal shelter, and he still does volunteer work there with his daughter.15\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n16\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in the \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n17\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n18\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n19\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n20\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n21\n5\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties at\nhearing require that Revised Adjudicative Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline H (drug\ninvolvement) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n18\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n19\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.20\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  In addition to\n21\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations, the government submitted sufficient information to\nshow that Applicant did not report his February 2006 arrest to his company\u2019s security office as\nrequired by the security disclosure policy he signed when he was hired in 2002 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He also\ndid not disclose his arrest during his first interview with a government investigator (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nWhile holding a security clearance, he admitted to using marijuana in February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.c),\nbut denies any use since then, despite testing positive while in drug counseling in October 2006.\nIn response to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant admitted the allegation, but asserted in his second\n(December 2006) interview that he did not volunteer information about his drug arrest or his drug\nuse on advice of his attorney. However, all of the information about this claim demonstrates his\nattorney was not giving advice about whether to comply with company procedures or other\nrequirements to disclose such adverse information. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s response to SOR \u00b6 2.b\n(as well as his \u201csecond hand smoke\u201d explanation for his October 2006 failed drug test) is not credible\n\n \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance;\u201d\n22\n \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\n23\nsecurity official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative;\u201d\n \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer as a condition of\n24\nemployment;\u201d\n \u201c the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\n25\nbeing confronted with the facts;\u201d\n \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\n26\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically\nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the\ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully;\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 24.\n27\n6\nbecause he lied to a government investigator in December 2006 about the details of his arrest and\nabout the full extent of his use of marijuana.\nApplicant may not be disqualified under Guideline E for the SOR \u00b6 2.c allegation. While it\nwas proven that he used drugs while holding a clearance, such conduct is covered under Guideline\nH (drug involvement) and must be addressed according to \u00b6 25(g).  As to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b,\n22\navailable information requires consideration of the disqualifying conditions listed in \u00b6\u00b6 16(b)  and\n23\n16(f)  of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines. \n24\nI also have considered possible application of the mitigating conditions listed at \u00b6\u00b6 17(a)25\nand 17(b),  but neither is supported by this record. Applicant did not make a prompt, good-faith\n26\neffort to correct his omission in his first interview because he did not disclose his arrest until nearly\nfive months later, when he was confronted with that information in a second interview. His claim\nregarding \u00b6 17(b) fails because his attorney advised him only about the disposition of the criminal\ncharges, not about company or government disclosure requirements. Even if Applicant had received\nqualified advice not to disclose his arrest, he was not subsequently truthful. He lied about what was\nfound in his car and he lied about his drug use. Applicant has failed to carry his burden of persuasion\nin response to the government\u2019s information. Accordingly, the Guideline E security concerns are not\nmitigated.\nDrug Involvement. Under Guideline H, \u201c[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations and\n27\nhis testimony about his drug use, the government presented sufficient information to show he used\nmarijuana in 1986 and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was arrested and charged with marijuana possession\nin February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he attended drug counseling between September and December\n2006 (SOR 1.c); that he tested positive for illegal drugs during that counseling (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that\nhe used marijuana while holding a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.e).\n\n \u201cAny drug abuse (see above definition);\u201d\n28\n \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use;\u201d\n29\n \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\n30\npossession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d\n See footnote 20, supra.\n31\n \u201c(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) dissociation from drug-using\n32\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation;\u201d\n \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\n33\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n See footnote 15, supra.\n34\n See footnote 14, supra.\n35\n7\nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c is not disqualifying. It merely presents additional information\nrelated to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. As to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e, available information requires\nconsideration of the disqualifying conditions listed in \u00b6\u00b6 25(a),  25(b),  25(c),  and, as noted above,\n28\n29\n30\n25(g)  of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Further, of the Guideline H mitigating conditions,\n31\nI have considered \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) - (4)  and have concluded Applicant may not benefit from any of those\n32\nfactors. While he no longer associates with friends who still use marijuana, his lack of candor about\nhis drug use precludes a definitive finding that he has abstained from marijuana use for any\nmeaningful length of time. Until his hearing, he denied any use in the past 20 years, and lied to a\ngovernment investigator about the drugs that were found in his car when he was arrested in February\n2006. \nI have also considered \u00b6 26(a),  and I decline to apply it here for many of the same reasons.\n33\nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility precludes a finding his drug use was remote in time, was infrequent,\nor that it is unlikely to recur. Because he lied about using marijuana since 1986, and lied about the\ndetails of his arrests in February 2006, and tested positive for drugs in October 2006, I conclude he\nprobably used marijuana at or after the time he started drug counseling in September 2006. Most\nimportant, his reluctance to take responsibility for his actions by fully and truthfully disclosing\ninformation about his drug use casts unmitigated doubt on his current reliability. Applicant has failed\nto carry his burden of persuasion in response to the government\u2019s information. Accordingly, the\nGuideline H security concerns are not mitigated.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines E and H. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  At 38 years of age, Applicant has yet to demonstrate the level of maturity\n34\nand trustworthiness expected of one in whom the government puts its trust. Applicant\u2019s response to\nthe adverse information in his background only reinforced the government\u2019s concerns about his\njudgment and trustworthiness. A fair and commonsense assessment  of the information before me\n35\nshows that the Applicant has not overcome the security concerns about his drug use and lack of\n\n See footnote 18, supra.\n36\n8\ncandor. As a result, doubts persist about his ability to protect classified information and to exercise\nthe requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one who holds a security clearance. Such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the national security.  \n36\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a :\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b :\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c :\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d :\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Paragraph 2 alleges that Applicant\u2019s valid Nigerian passport, his use of that passport in February 2007, and his equal loyalty to the U.S. and Nigeria indicates a foreign preference that may influence him to make decisions harmful to the U.S. He admitted all allegations under paragraph 1 except for subparagraph 1.e. He denied SOR 1.e. because his mother-in-law and father-in-law are also citizens of the U.S., and have lived in the U.S. for the past 23 years.

Perry, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on April 23, 2007.\nOn October 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign influence\n(Guideline B) and foreign preference (Guideline C). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on December 6, 2007. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on February 26, 2008, and the hearing was held on March 25, 2008.\nThe transcript was received on April 2, 2008.\nAt the hearing, the government submitted four exhibits (GE). The fourth exhibit\n(administrative notice exhibit) contains facts from United States Government agency\nApril 25, 2008\n\n2\npublications that describe the government of Nigeria, its human rights record, and\nvarious problems U.S. citizens face in traveling to the country. At the hearing, testimony\nwas taken from the Vice President (VP) of Applicant\u2019s employer and Applicant. He also\nsubmitted two exhibits (AE). The first exhibit (AE A) represents Applicant\u2019s request to\ntake administrative notice of the factual representations set fourth at nine locations of\nthe government\u2019s administrative source material. (GE 4) \nFindings of Fact\nForeign Influence\nThe SOR alleges in paragraph 1 that Applicant\u2019s ties and travel to Nigeria raise\nforeign influence concerns under Guideline B. Paragraph 2 alleges that Applicant\u2019s valid\nNigerian passport, his use of that passport in February 2007, and his equal loyalty to the\nU.S. and Nigeria indicates a foreign preference that may influence him to make\ndecisions harmful to the U.S. He admitted all allegations under paragraph 1 except for\nsubparagraph 1.e. He denied SOR 1.e. because his mother-in-law and father-in-law are\nalso citizens of the U.S., and have lived in the U.S. for the past 23 years. Applicant also\nadmitted subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b., but denied 2.c., claiming he could not recall\ntelling the investigator his loyalties were equally split between the two countries.\nApplicant is 36 years old. He was born in Nigeria and came to the U.S. in 1993\nfor educational reasons. According to his security clearance application (SCA, GE 1), he\nattended a university from January 1994 to December 1995. He transferred to a\ntechnical institute in August 1997, where he was enrolled until December 1998. He\nentered another university in this region in August 2002, and was awarded a Master\u2019s of\nBusiness degree in May 2005. \nGE 1 shows that between May 1996 and January 1998, Applicant was employed\nas an applications engineer with a private company; Applicant was apparently promoted\nto a software engineer position (at the same company) in January 1998, and worked in\nthat position until January 2000. From January 2000 to December 2005, he was\nemployed by a leading software company as a senior software engineer. Since\nDecember 2005, Applicant has been employed in same position with his current\nemployer. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, 77 years old, is a resident citizen of Nigeria. (SOR 1.a.) Since\n1977, she has been living in the southwestern part of Nigeria that is politically calm and\nstable; the area is not part of the Niger Delta region. (Tr. 34-36; GE 4). She still\noversees a private kindergarten school she owns, although she has relinquished the\nday-to-day operations to the principal. Her continuing association with the school keeps\nher mind challenged. Applicant\u2019s mother has never worked for the Nigerian government.\nEven though she owns the school, Applicant does not expect to inherit the property. \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in February 2007 at the age of 73 (GE 1), after a\nlengthy illness. The record does not disclose his father\u2019s employment, but he was\n\n According to Applicant\u2019s SCA (GE 1), they married in July 1998. \n1\n3\nretired when Applicant provided an interview to a federal investigator in September\n2006. (GE 3)\nApplicant contacts his mother by telephone about twice a month. He has been\nsending her about $300.00 every three months since 1996. The money symbolizes\nApplicant\u2019s respect for her efforts in properly raising him during his formative years. (Tr.\n59)\nApplicant\u2019s 40-year-old brother (SOR 1.b.) is a resident citizen of Nigeria. He\nlives in the same city as Applicant\u2019s mother. He is employed as an architect and owns\nhis own firm. Although Applicant\u2019s brother is licensed by the Nigerian government, he\nhas never worked on any government projects. (Tr. 41) Applicant contacts him about\nonce every two or three months.  \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a resident citizen of Nigeria. (SOR 1.b.) She is 42 years old,\nand lives in the same region as Applicant\u2019s mother. She teaches pharmacy at a local\nuniversity that receives public and private funds. Applicant is uncertain whether his\nsister\u2019s position makes her an employee of the Nigerian government. (Tr. 42) Applicant\nmaintains contact with his sister at a frequency of about once every three months. \nApplicant\u2019s has three remaining brothers who reside in the U.S. One is 34 years\nold, a permanent resident (SOR 1.c.), who has been living in the U.S. since 1998. The\nother two brothers were born in the United Kingdom and are naturalized U.S. citizens.\nOne is 56 years old and received his U.S. citizenship in September 2004. He has been\nliving in the U.S. since 1988. (Tr. 43) The last brother is 46 years old, and has lived in\nthe U.S. since 1995. He received his U.S. citizenship in 2004. (Tr. 43; GE 1) Applicant\u2019s\nthree brothers living in the U.S. are married with children. None of Applicant\u2019s brothers\nhave ever worked for the Nigerian government. (Tr. 45) Applicant last saw his three\nbrothers at their father\u2019s funeral in February 2007. (Tr. 52-54)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were born in Nigeria (SOR 1.e.), but\nbecame naturalized citizens of the U.S. They have lived and worked in the U.S. since\n1983. (Tr. 45; AE B )\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria (SOR 1.f.), and resides in\nthe U.S. with Applicant. He testified that they were married in September 1999,  and\n1\nhave three children, six, four, and three months. The three children were born in the\nU.S.\nApplicant has traveled to Nigeria (SOR 1.g.) in 2001, 2003, 2006, and 2007. In\n2001, he spent two weeks visiting his family in Nigeria. In 2003, he spent two weeks in\nNigeria visiting his mother and father for their birthdays. In 2006, he returned to Nigeria\nto comfort his sick father. Applicant\u2019s last trip to the country was to bury his father in\n2007. (Tr. 49) He used his Nigerian passport on all trips.\n\n4\nThe only financial interest Applicant and his wife have in Nigeria is approximately\n$25,000.00 in stock. They have no other financial interest in the country. Applicant has\nlived in the same house in the U.S. since March 2001. (GE 1) He believes the house is\nworth about $750,000.00. \nApplicant indicated he would report any efforts to pressure him to the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) because U.S. security and his family\u2019s security are\nparamount. Applicant\u2019s loyalty is only to the U.S., and that is why he emigrated to the\nU.S. in 1993. \nApplicant has not voted in a foreign election since becoming a U.S. citizen in\n2003 (Tr. 32), but has voted in three U.S. national or regional elections. In his position\nas the sound supervisor at his church since 1999, Applicant has directed a team in\nvideo taping the church sermons and music. (Tr. 57)\nForeign Preference\nUntil early March 2008, Applicant had a Nigerian passport scheduled to expire in\n2011. (SOR 2.a.) He used his Nigerian passport to travel to Nigeria in 2007. (SOR 2.b.)\nApplicant denied (in his answer to the SOR) telling the Office of Personnel Management\ninvestigator that he had divided loyalties to the U.S. and Nigeria. (SOR 2.c.) Applicant is\nmistaken as the second interview he had with the investigator in September 2006 (GE\n3), Applicant referred to his split loyalties. However, in his one-page attachment of\ncorrections to his interviews in 2006, dated August 2, 2007 (GE 3), Applicant stated:\nRegarding my loyalty to the United States: My loyalty lies with the United\nStates. The only reason why my wife and I kept our Nigerian passports is\nfor the ease of travel back and forth from US to Nigeria. However, our\nunquestioned loyalty lies with the US. In my security processing with NSA,\nI have submitted a Foreign Citizenship Renunciation Certification. I have\nincluded a copy of this certificate. (GE 3)\nBecause Applicant did not know his use of his Nigerian passport was a potential\nsecurity problem (Tr. 28), he continued to use it after becoming a U.S. citizen in July\n2003, and after receiving a U.S. passport in August 2003. Since receiving the SOR in\nOctober 2007, Applicant has not used his Nigerian passport, and has no intention of\nrenewing it. (Tr. 31)\nIn an attachment to GE 3, there is a form (Form G6411) entitled \u201cFOREIGN\nCITIZENSHIP RENUNCIATION CERTIFICATION,\u201d signed by Applicant and a security\nofficer on June 28, 2007. Just underneath the title of the form is a space for\nidentification of the \u201cCOUNTRY FORMERLY A CITIZEN OF.\u201d That space is blank. The\npurpose of the form is to verify the loyalty of an applicant who seeks sensitive\ncompartmented information (SCI). The form includes instructions to return a foreign\npassport and forego any other privileges of foreign citizenship.\n\n5\nAt the hearing, Applicant referred to the renunciation form he signed in June\n2007 in explaining the measures he had taken to renounce his citizenship. (Tr. 23) In\naddition to signing the form, he surrendered his passport to the security officer for\ndestruction in early March 2008. (Tr. 51) The VP of Applicant\u2019s employer displayed an\nenvelope containing the shredded passport. (Tr. 71) The VP testified that Applicant\u2019s\nwife transferred her Nigerian passport to the FSO for destruction on March 25, 2008.\n(Id.)\nWhen asked about the delay between signing the form in June 2007 and\ndestroying his Nigerian passport, Applicant testified, \u201cWell, I - - I - - I didn\u2019t see any\nurgency in doing it. I just kind of left it behind, you know. Not that I needed it. I didn\u2019t\nneed it any way.\u201d (Tr. 51, 52) When asked again to explain his answer he had just\nprovided concerning his delay in destroying his passport, Applicant stated, \u201cI said I\ndidn\u2019t see any urgency in destroying the passport. I - - I thought it was, you know, that\nthis was given up for the time being and I - - just kept the passport.\u201d(Id.)\nApplicant has not voted in a Nigerian election since becoming a U.S. citizen. (Tr.\n31, 32) He has voted in U.S. elections in 2004, November 2006, and January 2008.\nSince 1999, he has directed a video reproduction team for his church. (Tr 57, 58)\nCharacter Evidence\nThe VP has been working for Applicant\u2019s employer since 2002, and recalls that\nApplicant was hired in December 2005. The VP is not familiar with Applicant\u2019s job\nperformance because he does not work on classified projects. The VP believes\nApplicant is security conscious and has no security violations. He recommends him for\na position of trust. Finally, the VP is aware Applicant destroyed his passport (Tr. 70),\nand is aware his wife\u2019s Nigerian passport was turned over for destruction on the day of\nthe hearing. \nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken administrative notice GE 4 that consists of the following government\ndocuments:\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Background Note: Nigeria,\ndated October 2007;\nU.S. Department of State, Consular Information Sheet, Nigeria, dated April 16,\n2007;\nU.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007\nU.S. Department of State, Nigeria: Country Reports of Human Rights Practices-\n2006, dated March 6, 2007; and,\n\n6\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current\nIssues, dated April 12, 2007 (Congressional Research Service Report) at 1; \nNigeria, since gaining its independence in 1960, has been controlled more by\nmilitary rulers than democratically elected civilian rulers. Even though the government\nreturned to civilian rule in 1999, the government continues to have a poor human rights\nrecord. The lack of law and order in various areas of the country results in internal,\nperiodic armed conflicts between religious, political and ethnic factions, and external\nconflicts with travelers to the country, particularly in the Niger Delta region. Recognizing\nthe troubling problems in the Niger Delta region, the current president, elected in May\n2007, has pledged to restore peace and security to the region, while instilling long-term,\nelectoral reform throughout the country. President Bush considers Nigeria an important\npartner in the war on terror. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n7\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk of\nforcing an applicant into  a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and\nthe U.S. \nForeign Preference (FP)\nWhen an individual acts in a way that indicates a preference for a foreign country\nover the U.S., then he or she may be disposed to provide information or make decisions\nharmful to the U.S. \nAnalysis\nForeign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns where those contacts\nand interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or induced by a foreign\nentity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\nentity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign country where the\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to whether the foreign\ngovernment targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated\nwith the risk of terrorism. \nThe mere possession of family ties in foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the foreign influence guideline. When assessing the family ties, it is\nimportant to weigh the totality of these ties in a foreign country, rather than trying to\nweigh them in isolation. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2003)\nConsidering the record as a whole, the government has established its case under the\nFI guideline. FI disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies. Applicant\u2019s family ties to his\nrelatives, who are resident citizens of Nigeria, require him to present evidence in\nmitigation to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister and brother are resident citizens of Nigeria. While they\nrequire \nlicenses \nfrom \nthe \nNigerian \ngovernment, \nthey \nhave \nnever \nbeen\nagents/employees of the government. Applicant\u2019s second brother is a citizen of Nigeria,\nand a permanent resident alien of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s two other brothers are citizens of\nthe United Kingdom and the U.S. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are\ncitizens and residents of Nigeria and the U.S. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Nigeria and\nthe U.S., and lives with Applicant. Applicant has traveled to Nigeria in 2001, 2003, 2006,\nand 2007. His contact with his mother (about twice a month) and his sister and brother\n(about once every two or three months) create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation\nor manipulation within the scope of FI DC 7.a. \nI have concluded that FI DC 7.e. (a substantial business, financial , or property\ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business,\nwhich could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation) does not apply. Given the approximate value (approximately $750,00.00)\nof Applicant\u2019s home in the U.S., the $25,000.00 Applicant has in Nigerian stock is not\n\u201csubstantial\u201d financial interest that could expose Applicant to a heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence. \nThree of the six mitigating conditions (MC) under the FI guideline may apply to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, and sister have never been employed or agents of\nthe Nigerian Government. While there are law and order problems in Nigeria, they are\nnot in the politically stable area where Applicant\u2019s mother, brother and sister reside.\nGiven the good relations this country has with the U.S., it is highly unlikely the Nigerian\n\n I recognize relations between friendly nations can change, and not all cases of espionage against the U.S.\n2\nare committed by countries hostile to U.S. interests. ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar.29, 2002)\n9\ngovernment would attempt to target the family members of a U.S. citizen.  FI MC 8.a.\n2\napplies. \nFC MC 8.b. also applies in Applicant\u2019s favor based on his loyalty to the U.S.\nThough a person\u2019s statements of how he would act or react to a potential future event\ncannot be given much weight, Applicant\u2019s statements regarding coercion from foreign\nsources are entitled to some favorable consideration. ISCR Case No. 02-26826\n(November 12, 2003). Applicant has stated he would resist and report any attempt at\npressure to the appropriate authorities because of his concern for the security of the\nU.S., as well as his family. \nThere are a number of other reasons why I believe Applicant will not yield to\nforeign efforts to influence or exploit him through his family members. He has lived\ncontinuously in the U.S. since he turned 21 years old in 1993. He owns his home and\nhas lived there since 2001. While he and wife still own about $25,000.00 worth of stock\nin Nigeria, the stock cannot be considered \u201csubstantial,\u201d and pales in comparison to the\nvalue of his U.S. home. He married his wife (a naturalized U.S. citizen) in 1999. His\nchildren, ages 6, 4, and three months, were born in the U.S. After receiving continuing\neducation at a university and a technical institute in the late 1990s, he received his\nMasters of Business degree in May 2005. Applicant has continuously worked for\nAmerican employers since 1996. He and his wife have been U.S. citizens since 2003.\nApplicant has participated in American democracy by voting. He has been active in his\nchurch since 1999. Two of Applicant\u2019s three remaining brothers are naturalized U.S.\ncitizens that have lived in the U.S. for at least nine years. Applicant\u2019s last brother is not\na citizen of the U.S., but is a permanent resident, and has lived in the U.S. since 1998.\nFinally, his VP at his employer recommends him for a position of trust. Considering his\neducation accomplishments, his U.S. employment, and his family ties in this country, I\nexpect Applicant to resolve any potential conflict in favor of the U.S. His travel to Nigeria\nin 2001, 2003, 2006, and 2007 to visit or bury a member of his family are the\nreasonable actions of immigrants with relatives in a foreign country. \nForeign Preference (FP)\nWhen a person demonstrates by his actions that he prefers a foreign country\nover the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful the U.S. The record reflects before Applicant\u2019s FSO destroyed the passport in\nearly March 2008, he had a Nigerian passport that was valid until to 2011. He used his\nNigerian passport in February 2007 to participate in the burial of his father. FP DC\n10.a.(1) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member -\npossession of a current passport) applies. Applicant\u2019s possession of a valid passport\nuntil March 2008 after he used the passport in February 2007 constitutes proscribed\nconduct under FP DC 10.a.(1) While a person may describe himself as a dual citizen\n\n10\nbased on his feelings for the country where he was born, Applicant\u2019s use of his Nigerian\npassport before and after his September 2006 statement of divided loyalties is clearly\nevidence of his actions of foreign preference that occurred after he became a U.S.\ncitizen. Possession and/or use of the foreign passport after being naturalized as a U.S.\ncitizen constitutes the exercise of a privilege of his Nigerian citizenship that he was not\nentitled to. \nThough Applicant filled out a renouncement declaration in June 2007 (one-page\nattachment to GE 3), purportedly evidencing his willingness to renounce his Nigerian\ncitizenship, very little weight can be assigned to the document as probative evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s intent to renounce his Nigerian citizenship at the time. There is no evidence\nthe document was supplied to Nigeria or a U.S. agency, although Applicant believed his\ncompany was about to enter a contract with a U.S. security agency. Furthermore, the\ndeclaration (within the document) also directs the signer to destroy his passport, yet,\nApplicant waffled a bit when asked why he waited until March 2008 to destroy his\npassport. The delay strongly suggests Applicant had not resolved his intentions about\nrenouncing his citizenship in June 2007. \nA careful reading of his August 2007, attached corrections to his September\n2006 interview (GE 3), and his testimony regarding his willingness to renounce his\nNigerian citizenship weigh in his favor under FP MC 11.b. (the individual has expressed\na willingness to renounce dual citizenship), but are inadequate to satisfy his burden of\npersuasion under the FP guideline. Applicant\u2019s destruction of his Nigerian passport in\nMarch 2008 invokes the application of FP MC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered o the cognizant authority, or otherwise invalidated) Considering all the\nevidence under FP MC 11.b. and 11.e, I conclude Applicant has met his burden of\npersuasion under the FP guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FI and FP guidelines must still be evaluated in\nthe context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Applicant\u2019s regular contact with his three\nresident, citizen family members in Nigeria is overcome by his strong ties to the U.S.\nthat began when he emigrated from Nigeria to the U.S. almost 15 years ago. Having\nviewed the evidence in its entirety, I am confident he will resist and report any effort at\ncoercion from a foreign nation while continuing to demonstrate that his preference for\nU.S. interests is paramount.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C): \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 3,\n2005. On November 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nC for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n1\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 20, 2007, and requested\nthat his case be decided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nItem 2.\n2\nThe government submitted five items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4 at 3.\n4\n2\nhearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on December\n2\n31, 2007.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to\n3\nApplicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging\nreceipt of his copy of the FORM on January 15, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. After\nseeking and receiving additional time to respond from DOHA, Applicant responded to\nthe FORM in a letter, dated February 15, 2008, that he sent via Express Mail on\nFebruary 19, 2008, and DOHA received on February 21, 2008. In the letter, he disputed\nseveral factual inaccuracies in the FORM and some of Department Counsel\u2019s analysis,\nbut made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by the Government.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to consideration of anything submitted by Applicant.\nHe submitted a two-page \u201cDepartment Counsel\u2019s Reply to Applicant\u2019s Response to the\nFile of Relevant Materials,\u201d dated March 7, 2008, in which he briefly responded in\nattempt to counter five of the fifteen points in Applicant\u2019s response. This \u201cReply\u201d\ncontains legal arguments that are incorrect, and cites at least one case relying on\nsuperseded regulatory authority. To the extent it contains new information that\nDepartment Counsel wants to have considered, that material was not forwarded to\nApplicant for his objection or rebuttal as required in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7. Accordingly,\nexcept for the fact that Department Counsel offered no legal objection to consideration\nof Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, this \u201cReply\u201d will be completely disregarded and\nforms no basis for any findings or conclusions below. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 13, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 64-year-old contracts manager for a defense contractor, where he\nhas worked since June 1983. His mother and father were born in Germany in 1912 and\n1903, respectively. He was born in Israel in October 1943. He moved with his parents,\nyounger brother and sister, to the United States and they all became naturalized U.S.\ncitizens. Applicant\u2019s naturalization certificate was issued February 19, 1962. \nApplicant obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1967 and a master\u2019s degree in 1976.\nHe was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve in June\n1967. The record does not indicate how much time he spent on active duty, if any, but\nhe retired from the Air Force in 1988 as a Major. He stated that he did not travel to\nIsrael during his Air Force career because he did not want to face Israeli military service\nobligation issues.  The record is also unclear, but evidence indicates that he has held a\n4\nsecurity clearance almost the entire period since 1967, without incident. \n\nItem 4 at 2, 3, 7, 8, 10.\n5\nItems 4 and 5.\n6\n3\nIn his answer to the SOR, dated November 20, 2007, and his sworn answers to\nDOHA interrogatories, dated June 19, 2007, and August 14, 2007, Applicant admitted\nthe truth of all factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR, with explanations.\nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nApplicant applied for an Israeli passport, which was issued to him on June 5,\n1998. Having never renounced his Israeli citizenship, and with no intention to do so, he\nbelieves Israeli law requires him to use an Israeli passport when entering or leaving\nIsrael. He traveled to Israel for about ten days in July and August, 2005, and presented\nboth his Israeli and his U.S. passports to Israeli border authorities. His passport was\noriginally due to expire in June 1999. Applicant obtained three extensions, until June\n2000, May 2007, and June 2008. The passport is valid, and Applicant intends to\nmaintain a valid Israeli passport in the future for use in visiting Israel, particularly since\nhis children may move there.5\nApplicant answered two sets of DOHA Interrogatories on June 19, 2007, and\nAugust 14, 2007.  In the first response, he stated that he did not intend to surrender or\n6\ndestroy his Israeli passport. The second Interrogatory forwarded him a copy of the\n\u201cMoney Memo,\u201d dated August 16, 2000, regarding the possession or use of a foreign\npassport, and asked him again whether he intended to destroy, surrender, or invalidate\nhis Israeli passport. He again responded, \u201cNo.\u201d In his August 30, 2006 memorandum\nimplementing the revised adjudicative guidelines within DoD, the Under Secretary of\nDefense (Intelligence) explicitly stated that the revised guidelines supersede the \u201cMoney\nMemo\u201d concerning application of the Foreign Preference guideline. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process paragraph of the AG. The Administrative\nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 security concerns involving foreign preference arise because,\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;\n\n5\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other\nsuch benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business interests in\nanother country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s actions in obtaining and maintaining his currently valid Israeli\npassport raise security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(b) above. He was born an\nIsraeli citizen, but became a U.S. citizen in 1962. Obtaining an Israeli passport in 1998\nwas an action to obtain recognition of his continuing Israeli citizenship by the Israeli\ngovernment after he was too old to face compulsory military service there. He intends to\ncontinue possession and use of a current Israeli passport. \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate those security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n\n6\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\nApplicant\u2019s Israeli citizenship is based on his birth there. However, he came to\nthe United States at an early age and has been a U.S. citizen since 1962. He did not\nreturn to Israel until 2005, but obtained a passport recognizing his continuing Israeli\ncitizenship in 1998. This resumed assertion of Israeli citizenship forms the basis of the\nsecurity concern under this guideline, and is not mitigated by the fact that the basis of\nthat citizenship was birth location. Accordingly, \u00b6 11(a) provides minimal, if any, grounds\nfor mitigation in this case. Applicant is expressly unwilling to renounce dual citizenship,\nprecluding any mitigation under \u00b6 11(b). Applicant exercised the rights and privileges of\nan Israeli citizen by obtaining a passport when he was 54 years old, and 36 years after\nhe became a U.S. citizen, so \u00b6 11(c) provides no mitigation. \nApplicant provided no evidence of approval by a cognizant security authority for\nhis use of his Israeli passport, and has refused to destroy, surrender, or otherwise\ninvalidate it. Accordingly, \u00b6\u00b6 11(e) and 11(f) were not established. Since the allegations\ndo not include voting in Israeli elections, \u00b6 11(f) is not pertinent.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nindividual who is responsible for his choices and conduct. He held a security clearance\nthroughout his years in the Air Force and afterwards, without incident. Thirty-six years\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen, he sought and obtained an Israeli passport in recognition\nof his desire to be recognized as an Israeli citizen. However, he avoided any exercise of\nthe rights and privileges of Israeli citizens until 1998 because he did not want to face\n\n7\nApplicant objected that Department Counsel\u2019s whole person analysis ignored his record of military service and\nthe fact that his commission as a second lieutenant contains the boilerplate language expressing the\nPresident\u2019s \u201cspecial trust and confidence in [his] patriotism, valor, fidelity and abilities.\u201d W hile such service is\ncertainly relevant to evaluating Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, it is by no means determinative. The wording\non a commissioning certificate is not evidence that the President had any personal knowledge of Applicant\u2019s\nqualities, and his fitness in 1967 is of limited probative value given his intervening conduct.\n7\nIsraeli military service obligations. This is no longer a concern. Applicant\u2019s conduct is\nrecent, ongoing, and entirely voluntary. After being advised of the security concerns\nraised by his conduct, Applicant indicated a continuing unwillingness to change it. His\nmotivation is to effect recognition of his Israeli citizenship and spend more time there in\nthe future. His exercise of Israeli citizenship, and acceptance of the obligations thereof,\nincreases the potential for pressure or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s service as an officer in\nthe U.S. Air Force was prior to his obtaining and maintaining the validity of a foreign\npassport in recognition of his foreign citizenship.  While the \u201cMoney Memo\u201d is no longer\n7\nbinding guidance, the concerns underlying it remain valid and Applicant offered\ninsufficient evidence to mitigate these concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his obtaining, using and ongoing\npossession of a foreign passport in recognition of his foreign citizenship. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1987.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was also born in Iran. He met her while she was attending an \nAmerican university. They married in 1991. She became a U.S. citizen in 1996. They \nhave a ten-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter, both born in the U.S. Neither \nchild speaks Farsi, or has ever been to Iran.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in Iran in about 1992. His father was a business \nowner with no connection to the Iranian government. Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport had \nexpired and he did not return to Iran for his father\u2019s funeral. He was concerned that Iran \nmight require him to perform military service. His mother is about 89 or 90 years old. \nApplicant is unsure of her birth date. She is a citizen and resident of Iran. She lives in a \nmulti-story house that her husband left her. She has tenants in the building and receives \nrent from them. Applicant does not provide her economic support. She has never visited \nApplicant in the U.S. Applicant has returned to Iran twice since he left in 1974, in 1995 \nand 1998. Those are the only two occasions Applicant has seen his mother in more \nthan 33 years. He speaks with her on the telephone about four times a year.3  \n \n \nApplicant was the youngest of four brothers and four sisters. There are six \nremaining children, counting Applicant. The sister he stayed with when he first came to \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 14-16, 45-47; GE 1, 2; AE O. \n \n2 Tr. at 22-25; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 25-30, 48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nthe United States was a naturalized U.S. citizen. She died of cancer in 1998. She left \ntwo children who were both born in the U.S. A brother died in Iran in about 2002. His \nthree remaining sisters and one brother reside in the U.S. Two of his sisters are U.S. \ncitizens; one sister and one brother are permanent residents.4 \n \n \nApplicant has one sibling residing in Iran, his brother who is about five years \nolder than Applicant. His brother works in a private industry in Iran. To Applicant\u2019s \nknowledge, this brother has never worked for the Iranian government. Applicant has \nseen this brother twice in more than 30 years, once when he returned to Iran in 1995, \nand again in 1998. Applicant and this brother do not get along, as this brother beat \nApplicant when they were children. This brother called Applicant about six or seven \ntimes in 2006. Applicant believes his brother was looking for some type of absolution for \nthe abuse he heaped on Applicant as a child. Other than those calls, Applicant has had \nvery little contact with his brother. Applicant estimates with the exception of the \noccasions in 2006, he has spoken to his brother only four or five times in the last 20 \nyears. They last spoke in 2006.5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and brother in Iran do not know what he does for a living or \nthat he applied for a security clearance. Only one of his siblings knows that he applied \nfor a security clearance. His sister, who is an American citizen, helped Applicant \ncompile the family data for his security clearance application.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are divorced. Her mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen. \nHis wife\u2019s step-father is a native-born U.S. citizen. Her siblings are in the United States. \nHer father resides in Iran, but she has no communication with him.7  \n \n \nApplicant considered himself solely a U.S. citizen after he was naturalized, \nbelieving that constituted a renunciation of his Iranian citizenship. Iran continued to \nconsider him an Iranian citizen. He renewed his expired Iranian passport in about 1993, \nin anticipation of returning for a visit to Iran. Applicant consulted the U.S. State \nDepartment, which recommended that he not travel to Iran on a U.S. passport, as the \nU.S. passport could be confiscated and he could be arrested. This is consistent with the \nadvice in the State Department\u2019s Consular Information Sheet, as discussed below.8 He \nreturned to Iran in 1995, for a trip to pay respects to his deceased father. Applicant \nstayed at his mother\u2019s house and also saw his brother and one sister on the trip. He \nwas sick for most of the trip and did not feel that this gave him the closure that he \ndesired. He renewed his Iranian passport and returned to Iran again in 1998. He once \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 30-34, 38-42; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 34-37, GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 42-43. \n \n7 Tr. at 57-58. \n \n8 Tr. at 49, AE T; HE II. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nagain stayed at his mother\u2019s house and saw his brother and sister. Applicant did not \nhave a clearance at the time, but he reported both trips to his company.9  \n \n \nApplicant does not plan on returning to Iran. He did not go to Iran for his brother\u2019s \nfuneral in 2002. He has no intention to return for his mother\u2019s funeral when she passes \naway. His Iranian passport expired in 2003, and he did not renew it.10 In about 2006, \nApplicant discovered that under the policy in place at the time that he could not possess \na foreign passport and obtain a security clearance.11 Applicant called a DoD number for \nclarification on what to do about the expired Iranian passport. He was told that he \nshould go to the American Embassy. Applicant stated he was already in the U.S., and \nasked if he could just have someone witness him destroy the passport. The person told \nhim not to do that as the passport could come in handy some day. Applicant realized \nthat the person was not knowledgeable in this area and contacted the Iranian Interests \nSection of the Pakistan Embassy. He was told to return the passport to them. Applicant \nsent the expired Iranian passport to the Pakistan Embassy on September 12, 2006, \nwriting in the letter, \u201cI am returning my Iranian passport as I no longer need it and am a \nsingle citizen of the USA.\u201d12 On November 8, 2007, he sent another letter to the Iranian \nInterests Section of the Pakistan Embassy, stating: \n \nThis is a clarification of my letter of Sept 12-2006 when I returned my \npassport to your office. The purpose of this letter is to clearly state that I \ndenounce my Iranian citizenship as I am a sole citizen of the United \nStates and have been for almost 20 years.13 \n \n \nApplicant is proud to be an American citizen. He votes in U.S. elections. He has \nsubstantial U.S. assets, including a house worth more than $1,000,000, with about a \n$380,000 mortgage. He and his wife have savings and investments worth about another \n$600,000. Applicant still has affection for his mother, but because he has only seen her \ntwice in the last 30 years, they are not as close as a typical mother-son relationship. He \nwould do nothing to jeopardize his wife and children, and \u201cthe security of the United \nStates comes first above everything else.\u201d If his mother or brother were ever threatened \nbecause of him, he would contact his Security Officer and the U.S. Government security \nofficials. As one witness stated, \u201c[m]y opinion is that [Applicant] wants more than \nanything to have his children and grandchildren grow up American. In my mind, that is \nthe definition of a man committed to this nation.\u201d14 \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 49-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. at 54-55. \n \n11 Memorandum of August 16, 2000, by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, \nControl, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I) entitled \u201cGuidance to DoD Central Adjudication \nFacilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudication Guideline.\u201d The so-\ncalled \u201cMoney Memorandum\u201d was superseded by the implementation of the revised adjudicative \nguidelines on September 1, 2006. \n \n12 Tr. at 52-54; AE A. \n \n13 AE B. \n \n14 Tr. at 44-45, 48, 56, 60-61; AE G, P-S. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted numerous character letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nHe is described as a man of integrity, a hard-working talented engineer, who is \ntrustworthy, honest, law-abiding, dedicated, professional, and responsible, and a loyal, \nproud, committed U.S. citizen who should be granted a security clearance. He has \nreceived an excellent performance evaluation and various awards, accolades, and \nreferences15. \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d The U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n \nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n \nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n \nIts dismal human rights record. \n \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian- \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n15 AE C-L. \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personnel possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 7(a), Acontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Applicant has two family members in Iran, a \ncountry that is clearly hostile to the United States.16 It is considered the most active \nstate sponsor of terrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, \nserious human rights abuses against its people. Applicant\u2019s immediate family in Iran \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG && 7(a) and (b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n                                                          \n16 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); HE I-XI. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant has visited Iran and seen his elderly mother and brother twice in more \nthan 30 years. He and his brother have been estranged for years, and have had \nminimal contact except for a few years ago when his brother was apparently trying to \nmake amends for his actions against Applicant as a youth. He still has affection for his \nmother, but described it as less than normal because of their very limited contact. \nNeither his brother nor his mother has any association with the government of Iran. \nApplicant\u2019s closest family is in the United States. He is most committed to his wife and \ntwo children. He has four siblings and their families who are American citizens or \npermanent residents. His life, career, close family, assets, and allegiance all lie in the \nUnited States. I find it unlikely that Applicant would ever be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of Iran or a terrorist organization and the \ninterests of the U.S.  I further find there is no conflict of interest, because Applicant has \nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in America, that he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG && 8(a) and \n(b) are applicable. No other mitigating condition is applicable. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \nApplicant possessed and used an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) applied at one point, but the passport expired in 2003, and was surrendered in \n2006. The renewal of his Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen could raise concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of his Iranian citizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nApplicant considered himself exclusively a U.S. citizen after he was naturalized, \nbelieving that conferring of U.S. citizenship constituted a renunciation of his Iranian \ncitizenship. Iran, however, continued to consider him an Iranian citizen. He followed \nU.S. State Department advice and renewed his Iranian passport to travel to Iran in 1995 \nand 1998. He has no intention of ever returning to Iran. He surrendered his expired \n\n \n10 \n \n \nIranian passport to the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistan Embassy and formally \nrenounced his Iranian citizenship. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Iran. He was \nsent to Europe for school at about 16 years of age. He went from Europe to the U.S. \nwithout returning to Iran. He became a U.S. citizen in 1987, and his life and immediate \nfamily are now here. Applicant is an established, highly regarded engineer, with \nconsiderable U.S. ties and assets. Since Applicant left Iran more than 33 years ago, he \nhas only returned twice.  He did not return to Iran in 1992, when his father passed away.  \nApplicant believed the attainment and oath of becoming a U.S. citizen also served to \nrenounce his Iranian citizenship. Iran felt otherwise and continued to consider Applicant \none of its citizens. He wanted to pay respect to his deceased father, so he decided to \nlook into the possibility of traveling to Iran. He followed U.S. State Department advice \nand renewed his Iranian passport to travel to Iran in 1995 and 1998, as traveling to Iran \non a U.S. passport would be dangerous and ill-advised. The renewal of his Iranian \npassport was not because Applicant maintained a sense of loyalty or allegiance to Iran; \nit was the only viable option for Applicant to travel to Iran, and the method suggested by \nthe State Department. For the first time in more than 20 years, Applicant returned to \nIran in 1995, and visited his mother and brother. Applicant was sick most of the trip and \ndid not attain the sense of closure that he was hoping for. He returned to Iran for the last \ntime in 1998. He has no intention on returning to Iran for any purpose. He did not return \nin 2002 for his brother\u2019s funeral, and he has no intention to return when his elderly \nmother eventually passes away. Applicant has only seen his mother and brother twice \nin more than 33 years. He maintains some affection for his mother, but is essentially \nestranged from his brother. When Applicant decided that he would never return to Iran, \nsurrendered his expired passport, and renounced his citizenship, he was committing to \nhis immediate family and his life in America. He closed the book on his past Iranian life. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an Applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. Iran is the most active state sponsor of \nterrorism and has a dismal human rights record. That is not a good combination. I also \nnote that Applicant left Iran more than 33 years ago and only returned twice. He has \nbeen a U.S. citizen for more than 20 years. His wife is a U.S. citizen. Her mother, step-\nfather, and siblings are all in the U.S. His children were born in the U.S. and have never \nbeen to Iran. He has the respect of colleagues and U.S. assets of more $1,000,000. His \nmother is about 90 years old. His mother and brother have no connection to the Iranian \ngovernment. These facts minimize any potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. Applicant was sincere, open, and honest at the hearing. In the unlikely event \nthat his mother or brother were subjected to coercion or duress from the Iranian \ngovernment or terrorist groups, I further find that with Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., including his uncompromising commitment to his \ncountry, wife, and children, that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the U.S.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his Foreign \nInfluence and Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 18, 2005, Applicant signed and certified a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF-86). On October 11, 2006, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Sensitive Positions. On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nMay 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 24, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to an administrative \njudge on December 10, 2007, and it was then reassigned to a second administrative \njudge on January 9, 2008.  On January 31, 2008, the case was assigned to me.  I \nconvened a hearing on February 11, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called one witness, introduced nine exhibits (Ex.), and offered for \nadministrative notice facts about Nigeria compiled from five official documents of the \nU.S. Government. (The four-page compilation was identified as \u201cAdministrative Notice.\u201d  \nThe documents from which the compilation was drawn were marked HE I through V.)  \nEx. 1 through 4 were admitted without objection. Ex. 5 and Ex. 6 were admitted over \nApplicant\u2019s objections.  Ex. 7, 8, and 9 were withdrawn. Applicant called two witnesses \nand testified on this own behalf. The hearing was continued to permit the parties to \npursue additional discovery. \n \nThe hearing was resumed on April 17, 2008.  Applicant submitted one exhibit, \nwhich was marked as Ex. A and admitted without objection. Applicant submitted for \nadministrative notice a three-page document containing facts about Nigeria derived \nfrom official U.S. government publications previously offered by the Government. This \ndocument was marked HE VI and included in the record. Applicant again testified on his \nown behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the February 11, 2008 hearing (Tr. 1) on \nFebruary 20, 2008.  DOHA received the transcript of the April 17, 2008 hearing (Tr. II) \non April 28, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG C, Foreign \nPreference (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.); two allegations of disqualifying conduct under \nAG B, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.); and three allegations of disqualifying \nconduct under AG E, Personal Conduct.  In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthree AG C allegations and denied one.  He admitted both AG B allegations in the SOR, \nand he denied the three AG E allegations in the SOR. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), and employed \nsince May 2003 as a senior manager by a government contractor.1 Applicant was born \n \n1 Applicant has not held a security clearance in the past.  However, he claimed the U.S. Postal Service \nconducted an investigation of his background in July 2001.  (Ex. 2.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nin Nigeria and immigrated to the U.S. in 1980.  He came to the U.S. to pursue his \neducation, and in 1983, he was awarded a bachelor of business administration degree \nfrom a U.S. university.  (Ex. 2; Tr. I, 75-77.) \n \n \nApplicant was married to a U.S. citizen from 1982 to 1990, when they divorced.  \nIn August 2002, Applicant was in Nigeria and married in absentia to his second wife, a \ncitizen of Nigeria who had three children born in Nigeria. At the time of the marriage in \nabsentia, Applicant\u2019s second wife was residing in the U.S. with her children. Applicant \nadopted his second wife\u2019s children. She became a U.S. citizen in 2005, and her three \nchildren also become U.S. citizens.  Applicant and his second wife have one child \ntogether.  (Ex. 2; Tr. I, 174-177, 181-182.) \n \n \n  Applicant\u2019s mother, who is 80 years old, is a citizen and resident of Nigeria.  \nApplicant sends his mother approximately $100 every month for her support.  Recently, \nhe has increased the support he sends his mother to about $200 per month because \nshe needs additional money to pay for cancer treatments.  At his hearing, he testified he \nlast spoke with his mother about 2 to 3 months ago.  ( Ex. 4; Tr. I, 122-126.) \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on January 15, 1999.  At the time he \nbecame a U.S. citizen, he held a Nigerian passport with an expiration date of May 2001. \nHe applied for a U.S. passport. On January 28, 1999, he was issued a U.S. passport.  \nHe used his U.S. passport to travel to Nigeria from 1999 until about September 11, \n2001. On November 20, 2001, Applicant renewed his Nigerian passport to use when \ntraveling outside the U.S. He renewed the Nigerian passport because he feared he \nmight be targeted by terrorists if he presented his U.S. passport when traveling to \nNigeria. He used his Nigerian passport to enter and exit Nigeria during the periods from \nJuly 19, 2002 through September 17, 2002 and from December 31, 2002 through at \nleast May 21, 2003.  (Ex. 2; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Answer to SOR; Tr. I, 80-81, 149-150, 102-\n106.) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Nigeria in 2002 and 2003 in order to participate in a political \nmovement.2  Later, the movement coalesced into a political party.  Applicant ran for a \nhigh public office in Nigeria as a member of the political party. Applicant told his future \nemployer, who was also a personal friend, that he planned to run for public office in \nNigeria. The election was held in April 2003. Applicant did not vote in the election.  \nApplicant was not elected.  He returned to the U.S. in May 2003. (Ex. 5; Ex. 6; Tr. I, \n103-104, 110, 114-117, 160, 166; Tr. II, 29-30.) \n \n \nApplicant denied that his acquisition and use of a Nigerian passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen was an exercise of dual citizenship.  He denied that running for \npolitical office in Nigeria was an exercise of dual citizenship.  He stated he thought his \nNigerian citizenship was extinguished when he pledged his allegiance to the U.S. and \n \n2 During the time he was in Nigeria, he defined himself as a self-employed consultant.  He denied he \nworked for wages in Nigeria.  He asserted that he supported himself by living off $20,000 in savings that \nhe took with him.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \naccepted U.S. citizenship. He did not believe it was necessary to communicate with \nauthorized officials of the Nigerian government to renounce his Nigerian citizenship \nwhen he became a U.S. citizen.  He stated his involvement with the political movement \nin Nigeria was to educate Nigerians.  He also stated that the political party that evolved \nfrom the movement had no chance of winning an election in Nigeria. (Tr. I, 78-79, 84-\n88, 113-115.) \n \n \nI carefully observed and considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility at his \nhearing. I conclude that Applicant was not credible when he denied he exercised dual \ncitizenship with Nigeria and the United States.  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on March 18, 2005. \nQuestion 15 on the SF-86 reads as follows: \u201cYour Foreign Activities \u2013 Passport  In \nthe last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign \ngovernment?\u201d In response to question 15, Applicant answered affirmatively. He stated \nthat he had obtained a Nigerian passport, valid for five years, on November 20, 2001. \nHe explained further: \u201cObtained passport after September 11, 2001 terrorist incident in \nthe USA primarily for identification purposes when traveling outside USA.\u201d In response \nto Question 16 on the SF-86, Applicant provided the following information on his foreign \ntravel: \u201c2002/12/02 to 2003/05/03  NIGERIA  Participated as candidate for state election \nin Lagos in May 2003.\u201d  (Ex. 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator on August 25, 2006.  He \ntold the investigator he had kept his Nigerian passport which had expired in May 2001.  \nHe further stated he did not intend to renew his Nigerian passport. The report of the \npersonal subject interview was not clear whether Applicant was referring to his Nigerian \npassport which expired in May 2001 or his Nigerian passport scheduled to expire on \nNovember 19, 2006. The investigator testified that if Applicant had told him he had \nrenewed his Nigerian passport after it expired in May 2001, he would have noted that \nfact in his report. The investigator did not have access to Applicant\u2019s SF-86 and did not \nknow Applicant had renewed his Nigerian passport in November 2001. Applicant also \ntold the investigator that \u201call foreign travel since becoming a U.S. citizen has been on \nthe U.S. passport.\u201d  (Ex. 4: Personal Subject Interview; Tr. I 61-64; 67-71.) \n \n \nIn the interview, Applicant described his 2002 travel to Nigeria as volunteer work \nfor a non-political group seeking the betterment of Nigeria through education.3  He told \nthe investigator that he found conditions in Nigeria oppressive, and he stated that the \npeople did not respond to his efforts to educate them.  He stated that he gave up in May \n2003 and returned to the U.S.  (Ex. 4: Personal Subject Interview; Tr. I, 63-64.) \n \n \nThe authorized investigator who interviewed Applicant appeared as a \ngovernment witness and testified that the personal subject interview report he prepared \n \n3 Government Ex. 6 shows the homepage of a Nigerian political party.  A photograph of Applicant in \nNigerian native dress appears on the homepage. The homepage identifies him as the party\u2019s candidate.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nafter interviewing Applicant accurately reflected what Applicant had told him.  (Tr. I, 58-\n64.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was dated October 24, 2007. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant stated he had voided his expired Nigerian passports and had sent them, \nalong with a letter renouncing his Nigerian citizenship, to the Nigerian embassy. \nApplicant asserted the letter was attached to his answer, but it was not. At his resumed \nhearing, Applicant provided a letter, dated October 16, 2007, which read, in pertinent \npart, as follows:  \u201cI am a former Nigerian citizen and would like to return issued Nigerian \nPassports in my possession to the Nigerian authority.  Please let me know when I can \nbring the passports to the embassy and obtain a written acknowledgement from your \noffice.\u201d  Applicant included his mailing address and telephone number on the letter.  (Ex. \nA.) \n \n \nApplicant retained the passports. He cancelled them by marking each page \n\u201cVOID\u201d in the presence of his security officer. Department Counsel stipulated to \nApplicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s representation that the passports were cancelled. Applicant did \nnot send a letter to the Nigerian embassy renouncing his Nigerian citizenship. At his \nhearing he testified he had not received a response from the Nigerian embassy to his \nletter of October 16, 2007.  He testified he had not initiated any follow-up inquiries to the \nembassy, and he had not returned his voided passports to the embassy.  He stated he \nhad not officially renounced his Nigerian citizenship because he didn\u2019t think that it was \nnecessary after he \u201cswore to the flag of the United States\u201d at his naturalization \nceremony. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 3; Tr. I, 186; Tr. II, 14-21, 24.) \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Nigeria, drawn from  \nofficial US government documents:4 \n \nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa composed of 36 states and a \ncapital territory.  It has a population of approximately 140 million, making it \nthe most populous nation in Africa, accounting for half of West Africa\u2019s \npeople.  Since gaining independence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria has \nexperienced periods of political instability and turmoil, as well as economic \ncrisis.  Nigerian political life has been scarred by conflict along both ethnic \nand geographic lines and dominated by military coups and long military-\nimposed transition programs rather than civilian rule.  The military has \nruled Nigeria for approximately 28 of its 47 years since independence, and \nin May 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule. \n \n \n4 See U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007; U.S. Department of \nState, Consular Information Sheet, Nigeria, dated April 16, 2007; U.S. Department of State, Travel \nWarning: Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007; U.S. Department of State, Nigeria: Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices \u2013 2006, dated March 6, 2007; and Congressional Research Service, CRS Report for \nCongress, Nigeria: Current Issues, dated April 12, 2007. The Government\u2019s summary of these documents \nis marked HE I.  Applicant\u2019s summary of these documents is marked HE VI. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPresidential and legislative elections were held in Nigeria on April 21, \n2007, and President Obasanjo stepped down on May 29, 2007. The \ncurrent president is Musu Umaru Yar\u2019adua, a moderate and respected \ngovernor from the northern state of Katsina, who pledged publicly to make \nelectoral reform, peace, and security in the Niger Delta, and continued \nelectoral reform his top priorities. \n \nThe Nigerian government\u2019s human rights record is poor, and the \ngovernment continues to commit serious human rights abuses.  The State \nDepartment\u2019s Report on Human Rights Practices notes government \nofficials at all levels committed serious abuses.  U.S. citizens have \nexperienced harassment and shakedowns at checkpoints and during \nencounters with Nigerian officials.  Areas of Nigeria are marked by serious \ninstability and outbreaks of armed conflicts between religious, political, \nand ethnic factions.  Ongoing religious and ethnic conflicts exist in Nigeria \nbetween Muslim and Christian groups and among other ethnic groups. \n \nThe lack of law and order in Nigeria poses considerable risks to travelers, \nincluding the risk of armed robbery or kidnapping. Violent crime, \ncommitted by ordinary criminals, as well as by persons in police and \nmilitary uniforms, can occur throughout the country.  The U.S. Department \nof State updated its Travel Warning for Nigeria on October 30, 2007, in \nwhich it warned U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of \ncontinued deteriorations of the security situation in the Niger Delta region.  \nKidnapping for ransom of persons associated with the petroleum section, \nincluding U.S. citizens, remains common in the Niger Delta area.  The \nTravel Warning also states that al-Qaida leadership has expressed an \ninterest in overthrowing the government of Nigeria. \n   \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative  judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States.\u201d  Such an individual \u201cmay be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  These disqualifying conditions are as follows: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and, \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and  \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant acquired a U.S. passport and a Nigerian passport after becoming a \nU.S. citizen. He used his Nigerian passport to enter and exit Nigeria from July 19, 2002 \nthrough September 17, 2002 and from December 31, 2002 to at least May 21, 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s acquisition of a Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen raises a \nconcern that he actively exercised dual citizenship with Nigeria. While in Nigeria in 2002 \nand 2003, he involved himself in Nigerian politics and ran for public office in Nigeria. \nThese actions showed an allegiance to a country other than the U.S. \n \nI have carefully reviewed the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and the Foreign \nPreference AG. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct raises potentially disqualifying \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b610 (a)(1), \u00b610(a)(6), and AG \u00b610 (d). \n \nUnder AG \u00b611(a), dual citizenship might be mitigated if it is based solely on an \napplicant\u2019s parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Under AG \u00b6 11(b), an \nindividual\u2019s dual citizenship might be mitigated if he or she has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship.  Under AG \u00b611(c), an individual\u2019s exercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship might be mitigated if it occurred before \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.  Under AG \u00b611(d), an \nindividual\u2019s use of a foreign passport might be mitigated if it were approved by his \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \ncognizant security authority.  Under AG \u00b6 11(e), an individual\u2019s use of a foreign passport \nmight be mitigated if he presented credible evidence that the passport had been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant asserted at his hearing that he had voided his expired Nigerian \npassports, and he provided credible evidence to corroborate his assertion.  Thus, AG \u00b6 \n11(e) applies in mitigation. \n \nApplicant denied current Nigerian citizenship, but he failed to provide credible \nevidence to sustain a conclusion that he had expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship. Applicant also denied he exercised dual citizenship with Nigeria by acquiring \nand using a Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. Because he feared that \nterrorists might target him if he used his U.S. passport to travel to Nigeria, he acquired \nand used a Nigerian passport to protect himself and to mislead others about his U.S. \nnationality. He denied that, when he ran for political office in Nigeria after becoming a \nU.S. citizen, he showed a preference for Nigeria over the U.S.  He asserted that his \noath of allegiance to the U.S. nullified any potentially disqualifying conduct that \ndemonstrated a preference for Nigeria over the U.S. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nassertions were not credible and that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), and 11(d) are \ninapplicable in mitigation. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The following facts raise security concerns under disqualifying condition AG \n\u00b6 7(a):5  \n \n \nNigeria is a country in chaos, without the benefit of a stable lawful government, a \nsituation that threatens U.S. security interests.  American citizens with immediate family \n \n5 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d   \n\n \n10 \n \n \nmembers who are citizens or residents of Nigeria could be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Nigeria.  She is 80 years old and \nsuffering from cancer. Applicant is a dutiful son and each month he sends his mother \nmoney for her support and medical treatments. In the past, Applicant sent his mother \n$100 per month for her support. Recently, he increased his monthly payments to his \nmother to $200 per month to help her with medical expenses related to her cancer.  \nAdditionally, Applicant is in regular telephone contact with his mother.   \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his mother is filial and based on long-standing family \nties of affection and obligation.  Applicant is a dutiful son who looks after the welfare of \nhis mother. He is in frequent contact with her, and she relies upon him for her support. \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s age, citizenship, and residency in Nigeria create a heightened risk \nthat Applicant could be targeted for exploitation, pressure, or coercion by individuals or \ngroups operating outside of the law in Nigeria. These groups might also threaten U.S. \nsecurity interests. Applicant failed to provide information to rebut or mitigate these \nsecurity concerns.  I conclude that the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and \n8(c) are inapplicable. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nGuideline E,  Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, a personal conduct security concern arises when an \napplicant displays \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\u201d because such \nconduct \u201ccan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability \n\n \n11 \n \n \nto protect classified information.\u201d Additionally, Guideline E takes special note of \u201cany \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nI have carefully considered all of the potentially disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline E. I have especially considered AG \u00b6 16(b), which reads as follows: \n\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official \ngovernment representative.\u201d \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts in a personal security  \ninterview with an authorized investigator in August 2006.  Specifically, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant told the investigator that after he became a U.S. citizen in January 1999, \nand once his Nigerian passport expired in May 2001, he did not renew his Nigerian \npassport, when, in fact, the record established that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose that he renewed his Nigerian passport after it expired in May 2001. (SOR \u00b63.a.)  \nThe SOR also alleged that in his interview with the authorized investigator, Applicant \nasserted that, after he was issued a U.S. passport in January 1999, he used only his \nU.S. passport for foreign travel, when, in fact, he had used his Nigerian passport instead \nof his U.S passport to enter and exit Nigeria during the period beginning July 19, 2002 \nthrough September 17, 2002 and the period beginning December 31, 2002 to at least \nMay 21, 2003. (SOR \u00b63.b.)  Additionally, the SOR alleged that when he was interviewed \nby the authorized investigator, Applicant omitted material facts about his political activity \nin Nigeria by stating that the party he represented in national elections was non-political \nand working for the betterment of the country through education, when in fact it was an \nactual political party and Applicant ran for a high national office as a representative of \nthat party. (SOR \u00b63.c.) \n \n \nApplicant denied he deliberately falsified his answers to the questions of the \nauthorized investigator. The authorized investigator appeared as a government witness \nand credibly testified that the report of his interview with Applicant accurately presented \nwhat Applicant had told him. Applicant failed to present credible evidence of factual \nerror in the authorized investigator\u2019s report. Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. I \nconclude that AG \u00b616(b) applies to the facts of this case and raises a security concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s truthfulness, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \n \n \nI have carefully reviewed the several mitigating conditions under Guideline E, \nand I conclude that none of them apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n12 \n \n \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is a mature adult of 50 years of age. He is a college graduate and a CPA. In \nhis professional work, he must meet requirements of honesty and accuracy. In his \ninterview with an authorized investigator, he deliberately provided false or misleading \ninformation about whether he renewed his Nigerian passport, his use of his Nigerian \npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen, and the nature and extent of his political activity \nin Nigeria.  In his answer to the SOR, he provided misleading information when he said \nhe had returned his passports to the Embassy of Nigeria and had officially revoked his \nNigerian citizenship.  In fact, he had done neither.   \n \n As a U.S. citizen, Applicant traveled to Nigeria in 2002 and 2003. He used his \nNigerian passport to enter and leaved Nigeria. Once in Nigeria, he joined a political \nmovement which became a political party. He undertook actions which gave primacy to \nhis Nigerian citizenship over his U.S. citizenship.  While he attempted to minimize his \npolitical activity in Nigeria, the facts established that he ran for public office as a \nmember and representative of a Nigerian political party, thus exposing himself to the \npossibility of exploitation, pressure, or exploitation by a foreign group or government. \nThis conduct raised serious security concerns.  \n \nWhile Applicant provided credible evidence to corroborate his assertions that he \nhad voided his expired Nigerian passport and was not in possession of a current foreign \npassport, he failed to demonstrate that he was reliable, trustworthy, and capable of \nprotecting classified information. His general lack of candor made it difficult to rely on \nthe veracity of his statements. \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Adjudicative \nGuidelines C, B, and E.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Appellant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nBRAEMAN, Kathryn M., Administrative Judge: \n \nHistory of the Case \n \n            The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant on June 27, 2007. The SOR detailed reasons why the \nGovernment could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.1 \nThe SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial Considerations (Guideline F) in \nparagraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2 issued on December 29, \n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective September 1, \n2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of July 31, \n2007 where she admitted all of the allegations, and requested a hearing.   While \nApplicant paid some of her debts, she was unable to document efforts to establish a \nplan to resolve the remaining debts that resulted in large part from serious health issues \nwhen she was not covered by insurance.  Consequently, clearance is denied. \n \n     1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.    \n     2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with her Statement of Reasons (SOR). \nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n            Department Counsel on August 21, 2007, submitted a Ready to Proceed notice.  \nSubsequently the case was assigned to me on August 22, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing \nissued on August 28, 2007, set the matter for September 26, 2007. \n \n            At the hearing Department Counsel offered eight documents (Exhibits 1-8) that \nwere admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant offered and I admitted four \ndocuments (Exhibits A-D). She also testified.  At her request, and as the Department \nCounsel did not object, I left the record open until October 10, 2007, in order for her to \nsubmit supplemental information.  (TR 33; 52; 61-62)  However, no additional evidence \nwas submitted.  The transcript (TR) was received on October 4, 2007. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \n            Applicant is 53 years old and has worked as a warehouse specialist for a \ndefense contractor for 16 years, from 1991 to the present. Applicant completed a \nSecurity Clearance Application (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in June 2006. \n(Exhibit 1; TR 29)    \n \nShe married her first husband in 1971 and divorced in 1997; they had three \nchildren, now 37, 35, and 28.  She married her second husband in 1999; they have \nbeen separated since March 2006.  (Exhibit 1, TR 29-30)  \n \nFinances \n \n            When Applicant\u2019s first husband left the military in 1995, he was unable to find \nemployment until 1997.  In January 1997 they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; and their \ndebts of $21,000 were discharged in April 1997.   Their financial problems were made \nworse by their separation and divorce and by her health problems. She had a lot of \nmedical bills from her diabetes and had three children to support. (Exhibits 2, 3; TR 34-\n36; 44) \n             \n            Applicant disclosed on her SF 86 that she had two judgments in 2000 and \n2001.  She reported that she had bills over 180 days delinquent \u2013 a gas bill for $724, a \n2005 hospital bill for $1032, a 2005 hospital bill for $44,000, a 2005 credit card for $205, \na credit card bill for $72, a 2005 hospital bill for $370, a car loan for $5714, a 2004 \nhospital bill for $47, an electric bill for $238, a telephone bill for $237, a 2001 hospital bill \nfor $208, a 2001 loan for $5,656, and a 2000 credit card bill for $1,310. (Exhibit 1)   \n \n            Applicant admitted she accumulated 43 debts totaling about $34,000.  (Answer; \nExhibits 4, 5, 6)    She stated that she had subsequently paid a judgment from a dentist \n(SOR 1.e.), her cable bill (SOR 1.w.), a medical bill (SOR 1.aa.) and her telephone bill \n(SOR 1.ee. and 1.ff) in order to have telephone service restored.  I accept her testimony \nas her records were destroyed in a September 2006 house fire while she was in the \nhospital in 2006; she had a fire where her rental house burnt down in September 2006 \n\n \n \n3 \n \nand was a total loss.  She had renter\u2019s fire insurance which allowed her to get another \nrental house. She then had to buy all the essentials she lost. For several debts \nApplicant testified she does not know which creditor has the account as in some \ninstances the debts have been sold to collectors.  She has plans to resolve the smaller \nbills with minimal payments. (Exhibit A; TR 37-40; 51) \n \n            Applicant has had serious medical problems in the last two years, including two \nheart attacks. The first in September 2005 kept her off work until March 2006; the \nsecond one in September 2006 kept her off work for a month.  She also has been \ndiagnosed with congestive heart failure.  These health issues have added to her \nfinancial difficulties as during that time her job did not provide health insurance, so she \nhad to pay for the medicine she needed.  Her company\u2019s policies allow the health \ninsurance to lapse when an employee is off work for a certain period of time.   (Exhibit \nC; TR 43-46)  She received only $485 in disability insurance reimbursements.  (TR 47)  \nIn August 2007 she had additional health issues that kept her off work as she was again \nhospitalized.  (TR 48)  She had financial responsibility for all of her medical bills and \nmedications as she did not have insurance to cover them (Exhibits B, D; TR 53) \n \n            Recently in August 2007, Applicant consulted someone from her church to serve \nas a financial counselor; this person was consulting with Applicant to decide what plan \nwould work for Applicant to resolve her debts.  The plan was not finalized as this woman \nhad a death in her family and was unable to continue to meet with Applicant.  (TR 31-\n33; 48-49)  Applicant submitted no post-hearing documents describing her plan to \nresolve her delinquent debts. \n \n            Applicant is paying her current bills on time.  (TR 50)  She currently works forty \nhours per week.  (TR 51-52) \n \nPolicies \n \n            Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any particular adjudication \npolicy or condition is not decisive.   \n \n            Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I \nweighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and determined the following \nsecurity concern and AG was relevant to my determination: \n \nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern caused by financial problems is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                          \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation.  \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial \ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n            The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \napplicant's access to classified information. Then the applicant may present evidence to \nrefute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive \nOrder 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an \napplicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do \nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial \noverall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those \ninferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of \nrecord.   \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an \nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.3 It is merely an indication that the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a security clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n      \n            The government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nreflecting debts of about $34,000 to 43 creditors for medical and other debts.   \nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. Her financial problems are sufficiently significant to raise security \nconcerns. \n \n            With the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case \nagainst her.  \n \n     3Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \n \n            Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n            AG \u00b6 20(a) partially applies[1] because her financial problems \u201coccurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d She fell behind on the majority of \nher bills because of serious health issues where she had no health insurance provided \nby her long-term employer.  Also, she had periods of time where she could not work.  \nShe is now paying her bills on time.  She does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) \nbecause she will continue to be under financial stress until she is able to meet with her \nfinancial advisor, and to develop and implement her plan to resolve these debts.   \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that security concerns may be mitigated when, \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nAs discussed above, Applicant\u2019s financial issues result from a series of serious medical \nissues and a household fire that destroyed all of her possessions.  She explained how \nshe \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d by paying some of her debts.  \nHowever, she failed to demonstrate financial responsibility, as she did not provide \n \n[1]See generally ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available \nunder the good faith mitigating condition for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n  \n\n \n \n6 \n \nevidence that she has developed or implemented a plan to resolve her remaining \ndelinquent debts.  She receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b).   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies in part. Although Applicant did receive some financial \ncounseling, she did not finalize a plan to provide evidence that her financial problems \nwill be resolved in the future or are under control.  She testified and I accepted her \ntestimony as truthful that five SOR debts are paid.  To her credit, she was current on her \nmonthly expenses, but again, she provided no budget or plan to demonstrate her \nresponsibility and to demonstrate these financial problems are under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part because she \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort\u201d to repay \nsome of her overdue creditors; however, the majority of her debts remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply as Applicant did not \u201cdispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem.\u201d \n \nIn sum, Applicant credibly promised to resolve her remaining delinquent debts, \nbut she provided no details about her payment plan as to how she might do so.   \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \nApplicant is a full time worker, and has been one for sixteen years. She had \nseveral serious health issues that created high medical bills and prevented her from \nworking full time as she recovered.  Having considered both the record and Applicant in \nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I conclude she is a sincere person who made efforts \nto reform her financial practices.  However, she is not yet on the road to financial \nrecovery. While there is little potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress as \nshe has stable employment, she has substantial debts and very limited resources.   \n \nIn conclusion, financial issues remain a security concern. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude she failed to mitigate the security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations. I rule favorably for Applicant in subparagraphs \n1.e., 1.w., 1.aa., 1.ee, and 1.ff as she credibly testified that she paid these five debts \n(although receipts were not available due to a fire that destroyed all of her \npossessions).   \n \n Appellant\u2019s laudable, recent efforts, however, are not sufficient to remedy her \nfailure to provide proof of payments or payment plans for the majority of her delinquent \ndebts. So I rule against Applicant for subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d., subparagraphs \n1.f. through 1.v., subparagraphs 1.x. through 1.z., subparagraphs 1.bb. through 1.dd., \nand subparagraphs 1.gg. through 1.rr. Her recent, positive steps are not sufficient to \npersuade me that she should hold a security clearance. She could have done more to \naddress her delinquent debts.  \n \nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process \nsection, I make the following formal findings: \n                                               \n\n \n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1.

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts that stem in part from the payment failures of her\nspouse during periods of income losses attributable to his underemployment.  While Applicant and\nher spouse have since begun paying off their listed debts, their efforts are for the most part quite\nrecent and incomplete.  Based on the limited repayment efforts she and her spouse have\ndemonstrated to date, she is unable to mitigate security concerns associated with her past history of\ndelinquent debts.  Applicant successfully refuted allegations that she falsified his security clearance\napplication, but failed to mitigate additional security concerns attributable to her failure to provide\nrequested financial releases, and agree to a follow-up OPM interview.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 11, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on August 14, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on September 12, 2007.  A\nhearing was held on September 12, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of one witness (an OPM investigator) and\nthree  exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was\nreceived on September 20, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to permit\nher the opportunity to document her payments to her creditors.  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted seven days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn was allowed five days\nto respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant furnished a two-month checking account summary\ncovering the period of July to September 2007, statements documenting her payments on a non-listed\naccount, pay offs of her student loans, and payments on her creditor 1.e and creditor 1.f/g debts.  For\ngood cause demonstrated, Applicant\u2019s supplemental exhibits are admitted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits\nC through F. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated seven delinquent debts\nexceeding $40,000.00.  Under Guideline E, she is alleged to have (a) falsified her electronic\nquestionnaire for investigations (e-QIP) of August 2006 by omitting her debts over 180 and 90 days\n\n3\ndelinquent, respectively, and (b) failing to cooperate by (i) declining to execute financial releases in\nNovember 2006 and (ii) declining to submit to an additional interview at her place of employment\nor agree to a more convenient time for the agent to return.\nFor her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to three of the listed debts, but denied the\nremainder of them (claiming they belonged to her spouse).  Applicant denied falsifying her e-QIP\nand failing to cooperate.  She claimed she gave the investigating agent copies of her cleared checks\nand denied any further contact with the agent until January 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 39-year-old accounts payable specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated\nherein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBetween 2003 and 2005, Applicant and her spouse opened joint accounts with the creditors\nlisted in the SOR.  These debts appear on her credit report as joint marital debts and must be\nconsidered as such, absent probative evidence that the debts were created by her spouse alone and\nwere neither intended to benefit Applicant nor did so in fact.  This is a rather tall evidentiary burden,\nwhich Applicant has not met.  She has neither challenged her disputed creditors and the credit\nreporting firm nor otherwise demonstrated at hearing that the debts are not her responsibility. \nBurdened by her parenting responsibilities with her two children, she regularly deferred to\nher spouse to pay their debts.  Her husband, who was underemployed during key periods between\n2003 and 2005, stopped paying on some of their debts.  Applicant assures that after the birth of her\nsecond child, her spouse took over the responsibilities for paying their bills and did not confide in\nher about the financial difficulties they were experiencing (R.T., at 33).  Her spouse admits to not\nkeeping her informed of their financial problems (see ex. A).  Without informing Applicant, he\nborrowed heavily on their Navy Credit Union accounts to repay their other debts during their period\nof reduced family income (R.T., at 46-48).\nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant and her spouse have initiated efforts to pay  some of their\ncreditors.  Applicant documents paying off her creditor 1.a account and making payments on her\ncreditor 1.e repossession deficiency and creditor 1.f/g credit union accounts (see exs. C and F; R.T.,\nat 40).  She documents also paying off her non-listed student loan accounts (see ex. E).  She claimed\nshe has since paid off the $11,000.00 balance with funds furnished by her aunt, who she has not yet\nbegun to repay.  Applicant was afforded an opportunity to supplement the record with payment\ndocumentation regarding this creditor 1.d debt (R.T., at 44-45).  Her supplemented bank statement\nand other statements provided make no references to her creditor 1.d debt. Whether this debt was\nactually paid or not cannot be documented from the post-hearing materials furnished by Applicant.\nAs for her debts covering creditors 1.b and 1.c, she provides no documented repayment.\nApplicant assures she is working on repaying the remaining listed accounts, and has tasked\nher spouse to contact creditors 1.b and 1.c and 1.e through 1.g). Her spouse just recently started a\nnew job and now brings home around $4,000.00 a month (R.T., at 48-49).   Previously, he netted less\nthan $1,200.00 a month, which produced, together with Applicant\u2019s $1,800.00 a month (R.T., at 48),\n\n4\na monthly net of around $3,000.00 a month (R.T., at 52).  Applicant and her spouse have no mutual\nfunds or savings accounts and  maintain a very small checking account (R.T., at 51-52).  Neither\nApplicant nor her spouse have received financial counseling since they began encountering financial\ndifficulties. \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in August 2006, Applicant omitted her debts over 180 and 90\ndays delinquent, respectively.  She attributes her omissions to her unawareness at the time that she\nhad any delinquent debts (R.T., at ).  She had deferred to her spouse to pay the bills and was not told\nof any delinquent debts.  Her spouse corroborates Applicant\u2019s claims.  When asked, though, by an\ninterviewing OPM agent in November 2006 to complete financial releases, Applicant declined (see\nex. 3; R.T., at 24-25).  She did indicate that she and her spouse fully intended to pay off their\ndelinquent obligations, and she agreed to provide copies of her canceled checks (see ex. 3).  The\nsame OPM agent returned in December 2006 to interview Applicant (R.T., at 25).  At this interview,\nshe provided copies of her checks, but declined to be interviewed further about her finances.  The\nagent offered to be flexible about scheduling, but Applicant (claiming he was rude) still refused to\nbe interviewed again (R.T., at 25-26, 35).  \nAt hearing, Applicant said she checked with her supervisor after her interview with the OPM\nagent and was told she did not require a clearance (R.T., at 58).  She claimed her human resource\nmanager suggested she apply for a clearance, but initially never advised her that her company was\nsponsoring her clearance application (R.T., at 59-61).  She says that her resource manager advised\nher later (after she completed her e-QIP and was interviewed by OPM) that  she needed a clearance\nfor her company\u2019s federal contract (R.T., at 63-64).  She states that had she known initially that her\ncompany had sponsored her for a clearance she might have provided the requested financial releases\n(R.T., at 65).  Applicant could not corroborate her claims in any way.  The information provided\nApplicant,  both by her supervisor/human resources manager in the beginning and by the OPM agent\nwho subsequently came to interview her in November and December 2006, was sufficient to apprise\nher of the nature of the Government\u2019s background investigation and her corresponding need to be\ncooperative in all phases of the investigation.\nApplicant is well regarded by her supervisor and work colleagues and is reputed to be\nresponsible and trustworthy (see ex. B).  A coworker grades her with high marks in her business and\npersonal life (ex. B).\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n5\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is an accounts payable specialist for a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts over a three-year period spanning 2003 and 2005, while deferring to\nher spouse to pay their bills.  Each of the accounts are considered marital debts.  These debts,\nconsidered together, and without resolution,  raise  security  concerns, along with the omissions of\nthe same in her e-QIP.  Security significant, too, are Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to cooperate with\nan interviewing OPM agent about her security clearance application.\nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and her past failures to document payments on any\nof her listed debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and\nDC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to her deferring to her spouse who was not able to\nattend to the debts during periods of reduced income, and tried unsuccessfully to cover their other\ndebts with Navy credit union loans.   Except for her student loans, neither Applicant nor her spouse\nhad any contact with their creditors to resolve their debts before receiving the SOR. \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has initiated efforts to resolve some of her listed\ndelinquent debts. Specifically, she is able to document paying off one of her listed creditors\n(creditor 1.a) and repaying her student loans.  She documents also paying on one of the non-listed\ncreditors and initiating repayment of her creditor 1.e repossession deficiency and her Navy Credit\nUnion debts (creditors 1.f and 1.g).   She expresses hope of working on her remaining creditor\naccounts.  Because of her husband\u2019s work losses that contributed to their financial difficulties,\nApplicant may rely somewhat on MC 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) of the Guidelines for financial considerations. \nWithout financial counseling and a stronger repayment history, though, mitigation credit is\nmore difficult for Applicant at this time.  Her repayment efforts to date entitle her some advantage\nof MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) of the Guidelines. However, her repayment efforts, while encouraging, remain a work\nin progress. With her spouses\u2019s increased contributions to the family\u2019s aggregate income, Applicant\nshould be able to make continued progress in the repayment of her listed delinquent debts.  At this\ntime, though, it is still too soon to make any safe predictions about her ability to repay her debts in\nthe foreseeable future.  Based on her repayment history to date, Applicant may not take advantage\nof any of the other available mitigating conditions.\n\n7\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person\ncleared to access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the\nholder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial\ndifficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the debt accumulations\nof Applicant and her spouse and the limited steps they have taken to date to resolve them, Applicant\ndoes not mitigate security concerns related to her established debt delinquencies.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.b through 1.g of\nthe SOR.  Applicant is entitled to mitigation credit with respect to creditor 1.a, for which she\nprovides payment documentation.\nE-QIP issues\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under\nthe personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of her omissions of her debts in the e-QIP she\ncompleted in August  2006.  By omitting debts attributable to her over 180 and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively, Applicant failed to furnish materially important background information about her\ndebts that was needed for the Government to properly process and evaluate her security clearance\napplication. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions are attributable to her accepted impressions that she had no\ndebts of her own that were over 180 and 90 days delinquent with creditors 1.a through 1.g.\nApplicant\u2019s impressions, while mistaken, were made in good faith, without any indicated intent to\nmislead. Applicant\u2019s explanations, considering the circumstances surrounding the furnished\ninformation at the time, enable her to refute the falsification allegations.  Considering all of the\nevidence produced in this record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 2.a\nand 2.b of Guideline E.\nCooperation issues\nInterested in following up on Applicant's e-QIP submission after obtaining a copy of her\ncredit report, an OPM agent tried in vain to resolve his agency\u2019s concerns with his initial and\nfollow-up interview in November 2006. In the first interview, he asked for the standard financial\nrelease to enable him substantiate information in Applicant\u2019s obtained credit report.  Asked to\nprovide a financial release, Applicant declined, citing privacy concerns.  His attempts, in turn, to\nschedule a follow-up interview with Applicant to discuss her finances were rebuffed.  By all\ntangible indications in the developed record, Applicant failed to cooperate with the OPM agent\ntasked to investigate her background eligibility for holding a security clearance.  To date, Applicant\nhas still not provided the requested financial releases, or agreed to reschedule another OPM\ninterview.  \nAppraising the security significance of Applicant\u2019s cooperation failures, a number of\ndisqualifying conditions under the personal conduct guideline are applicable.  Applicant\u2019s failure\nand refusal to provide the requested financial releases and sit for a second OPM interview raises\n\n8\nsecurity concerns covered by the personal conduct guideline that normally mandate an unfavorable\nclearance action.  Specifically, 15(a) (refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security investigator\nfor subject interview, completing security forms or releases, and cooperation with medical or\npsychological evaluation) applies herein to Applicant\u2019s refusal to provide a financial release or\nagree to reschedule a second OPM interview when expressly asked by the appearing OPM agent\nin December 2006.  In such a case (as here) where the clearance applicant persists in her refusal to\nprovide requested financial information and meet for a requested interview, cooperation strains\nemerge that are at odds with that agency\u2019s security requirements.\nApplicant can be granted no excuse from the accepted regulatory requirement of cooperating\nwith the Government\u2019s background investigation of her security clearance worthiness and\neligibility.  Applicant\u2019s refusals to complete financial releases and agree to the rescheduling of a\nsecond OPM interview to address her reported debts in her latest credit report  (as here) represent\nmaterial breaches of her fiducial responsibilities to cooperate with the Government in all stages of\nprocessing of her security clearance application.  While Applicant might well believe she does not\nneed a security clearance for her work assignment based on information supplied by her supervisor,\nher employer manifestly determined otherwise and submitted the required application materials in\nApplicant\u2019s behalf.  \nBased on Applicant\u2019s  repeated and continuous refusal to cooperate with the Government\nin its background investigation of her clearance eligibility, no mitigating conditions under the\npersonal conduct guideline are available to her.  While her most recent efforts in supplying updated\nfinancial information about her repayment initiatives are encouraging, more probative\ndemonstrations of her willingness to cooperate are needed before Applicant can be fully credited\nwith eliminating all residual concerns about her willingness to cooperate with Government\ninvestigators and the Government\u2019s correlative concerns about her reliability and trustworthiness\nto hold a security clearance.\nAltogether, Applicant\u2019s extenuation and mitigation efforts fail at this time to quell the still\nactive concerns about her reliability and trustworthiness associated with her past failures to\ncooperate fully with the instituted background inquiries of OPM.  Unfavorable  conclusions\nwarrant, accordingly, with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraph 2.c of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

On July 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 2, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non August 24, 2007.  The case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge\non August 29, 2007.  I received the case assignment on December 13, 2007.

These documents are attached to\n1\nthe record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O for Identification.  This exhibit was not admitted into evidence and the documents\nwere not considered in making this decision.\n2\nmade to hold the hearing via video tele-conference.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non February 6, 2008, setting the hearing for February 25, 2008. Due to mechanical\ndifficulties, the hearing was not held on that day.  \nThe hearing was convened on March 13, 2008.  The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K, without\nobjection. The Applicant requested that the record remain open for the submission of\nadditional documents.  Given his location overseas, the record was held open until\nMarch 31, 2008, for the receipt of additional matters.  The Applicant submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits L, M and N in a timely fashion, all of which were received without\nobjection.   DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on March 24, 2008.  The record\n1\nclosed on March 31, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 43, divorced and is a retired non-commissioned officer in the\nArmed Forces.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security\nclearance previously granted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant retired from the Armed Forces in May 2003 as an E-6.  He began\nwork as a full-time employee for a Defense contractor in June 2003.\nThe Applicant married his now ex-wife in August 2002.  She turned out to be an\nex-convict and a con artist.  During their marriage, which ended in April 2004, she ran\nup the bills described in the SOR, as well as others.  She also deceived the Applicant\nconcerning an alleged pregnancy of hers.  Eventually, she was arrested in one State on\na parole violation from another State, was convicted, and her present whereabouts are\nunknown.  (Transcript at 43-45; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)  \nBeginning in February 2004, the Applicant began paying off his past-due\nindebtedness.  That month he paid off NCO Financial.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  In\nDecember 2004, he paid Beneficial.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)  Other available records,\nincluding the Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report, dated February 26, 2008, show at\nleast ten additional paid collection accounts.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 18, 21, 24, 26-33\nand Government Exhibit 9.)  Since 2004, the Applicant has paid at least $8,209.14\ntowards these additional accounts.\n\n3\nThe Applicant testified that these payments were pursuant to his plan for\nresolving his past due indebtedness.  He did not have the funds to pay all of the debts\nat once, but as he got funds together, he would contact a creditor and make an\narrangement that he could immediately fulfill.  (Transcript at 65-67.)  As of the date the\nSOR was issued, according to all the information available to the Government at that\ntime, the Applicant still owed four creditors.\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $12,862.00\nfor a repossessed automobile that was purchased by his ex-wife.  He began paying\ndown this account in July 2007.  (Transcript at 40-43, 45-48; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  The\nApplicant successfully paid this debt for a negotiated amount ($12,115.00) on March 24,\n2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits L, M and N.)  \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $10,075.00\nto a credit union.  This debt was related to a loan he took out to pay his ex-wife\u2019s\nindebtedness.  The Applicant has been making payments on this debt with an allotment\nfrom his military retirement pay.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The available records show\nthat the credit union began crediting his account in December 2004.  He has continued\nto make payments on this account by allotment.  As of the date of the hearing he had\npaid at least $2,150.00 on this account and still owed $8,008.05.  (Government Exhibit 2\nat 19-20; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  The Applicant testified that, once the debt in\nsubparagraph 1.a. was paid off, he would increase the payments on this debt to\n$2,000.00 a month until it was resolved.  (Transcript at 49-53.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $15,574.00\nto the same credit union as subparagraph 1.b.  This debt was related to a loan he took\nout to pay his ex-wife\u2019s indebtedness.  The Applicant has been making payments on\nthis debt with an allotment from his military retirement pay.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  The\navailable records show that the credit union began crediting his account in October\n2004.  He has continued to make payments on this account by allotment.  As of the date\nof the hearing he had paid at least $3,400.21 on this account and still owed $11,434.90.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 16-17; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  The Applicant testified that,\nonce the debts in subparagraphs 1 and 2 were paid off, he would increase the\npayments on this debt to $2,000.00 a month until it was resolved.  (Transcript at 53-55.)\nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $438.00\nfor a cable bill.  He paid this debt in full on May 10, 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)\nAs of the date the record closed, he had paid $18,103.21 towards the four debts\nin the SOR.  Since March 2004 the Applicant has paid at least $26,312.35 towards all of\nhis past due debts.  His current indebtedness stands at $19,442.95.  Finally, the\nApplicant testified that he is able to pay all of his current debts in a timely fashion and\npay his past due obligations as discussed above.  (Transcript at 48-49.)\n\n4\nMitigation\nThe Applicant had a successful military career.  He submitted documents that\nshowed he was a respected non-commissioned officer.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 6;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)\nThe Applicant also submitted letters from supervisors and co-workers.  They\ndescribe the Applicant as \u201cvery honest,\u201d and a \u201cconsummate professional.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit I.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n5\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThe Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b.,\n1.c. and 1.d.  The evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. . . . divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n The Applicant was involved in a disastrous marriage with a convicted con artist\nwho left him thousands of dollars in debt.  While obtaining his divorce he also\nimmediately went to work paying his past due debts off.  As described at length above,\n\n6\nthe Applicant had a plan to pay off his past due indebtedness and, for over four years,\nhas been successfully fulfilling it.  I find the behavior occurred under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this\npotentially mitigating condition.\n \nAG \u00b620(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b620(d).\nThe Applicant is able to pay his current bills and also pay close to $2,000.00 a month\ntowards the older debts.  His past due indebtedness has been reduced from over\n$45,000.00 to less than $20,000.00  He has control over his current indebtedness and,\nfor several years, has paid a substantial amount of money towards the arrearage.  I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant was involved in a bad\nmarriage with a bad person.  She left him deeply in debt.  Rather than avoid it, he\nimmediately began to pay his debts once he knew their full extent and has already paid\na substantial amount towards them.  He has a plan to pay all of his debts and is fulfilling\nit.  He has behaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and\nthat the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 33-year-old diplomatic protective security officer, employed by a federal contractor since November 2006. She has never held a security clearance. She is married and has two children, ages 12 and 13. Her supervisor describes her as knowledgeable, honest, dedicated, poised, and able to handle any situation with confidence (AX M). Two of Applicant\u2019s neighbors testified about her integrity and her commitment to her family and her work (Tr. 100, 102, 106).

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGregory Moohn, Union Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nDuring 2001-2006, Applicant underwent five surgical procedures and incurred 30 delinquent\nmedical debts totaling about $23,959.  She also incurred delinquent debts for cell phones given to\nfamily and a friend and for rented videos not returned by family members.  All debts except the\nmedical debts have been paid in full.  Applicant is enrolled in a credit counseling program and has\na five-year payment plan for her medical debts.  Security concerns based on financial considerations\nare mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on October 16, 2006.  On July 12, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security clearance. This action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960),\nas amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations)\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 20, 2007, admitted the factual allegations,\noffered explanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 2, 2007.\nOn October 16, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for November 7, 2007.  The notice\nwas sent to an attorney, based on information from Applicant.  The attorney decided not to take the\ncase.  Applicant\u2019s personal representative entered his appearance on November 3, 2007.  The case\nwas heard on November 7, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until November 25 to enable\nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence.  She submitted her additional evidence on the\nafternoon of November 7, and it has been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) CCC.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s comments on the post-hearing submission are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit\nI.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old diplomatic protective security officer, employed by a federal\ncontractor since November 2006.  She has never held a security clearance.  She is married and has\ntwo children, ages 12 and 13.  Her supervisor describes her as knowledgeable, honest, dedicated,\npoised, and able to handle any situation with confidence (AX M).  Two of Applicant\u2019s neighbors\ntestified about her integrity and her commitment to her family and her work (Tr. 100, 102, 106).\nIn February 2000, Applicant received a diploma with honors from a professional career\ndevelopment institute (AX X; AX Y).  In April 2001, she completed training at a technical institute\nand received a certificate as a medical assistant (AX S; AX U).  In April 2006, she completed her\ncollege education and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice administration (AX R; AX V).\nIn November 2006, she completed training as a uniformed protection officer (AX T) and in April\n2007, she completed basic firearms training (AX W).  She is now in a graduate program, scheduled\nto graduate in September 2008 with a master\u2019s degree in administration of justice and security (AX\nJ at 2).  She has student loans of about $43,000, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, that are in a deferred status\n(Government Exhibit (GX) 4 at 4-5; AX J; AX AA at 18-20).\nApplicant worked at various jobs before attending college and graduate school.  She lived\nin the southwest United States before moving to the east coast in June 2006, looking for better\n\n3\nemployment opportunities.  A friend from her former residence described her as strong-willed, goal-\ndirected, hard-working, and a person of high integrity. (AX N).  A former supervisor described her\nas extremely reliable, a team player, and possessing excellent skills in dealing with people (AX O;\nTr. 82). A medical doctor for whom she worked described her as responsible, dependable,\ncompassionate, and well liked (AX P).  Another former supervisor described her as exceptionally\nwilling, capable, pleasant, and requiring little or no supervision (AX Q; Tr. 84).  \nIn May 2002, Applicant opened two cell phone accounts for her husband while they were\ngeographically separated, and expected him to pay the bills when they were due.  He failed to make\nthe payments, and these accounts were placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  In December 2004,\nApplicant opened a cell phone account for a friend, trusting her to make the payments.  When the\nfriend failed to make the payments, the accounts were placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a).  In August\n2007, Applicant contacted the collection agencies and paid all three accounts in full (Tr. 54; AX B;\nAX F).  \nBetween 2001 and 2006, Applicant had five surgical procedures but had no medical\ninsurance.  She incurred the 30 medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, totaling about $23,959.  For three\nof the surgeries, she was on unpaid leave for about six weeks (Tr. 64-65).  She offered to pay $20\nper month on the medical bills, but her offer was rejected (Tr. 47).  She was unaware that credit\ncounseling services existed until her sister, who also had financial problems, enrolled in a credit\ncounseling program and told Applicant about it (Tr. 66).  In October 2007, Applicant contacted a\ncredit counseling service and consolidated most of her medical debts in a five-year plan calling for\npayments of $515 per month, beginning in November 2007 (AX C).  Three smaller medical debts\n($256, $50, and $25) were paid in full in August 2007 (AX D).\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c were late charges for videos incurred in June and September\n2001.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g was for unreturned videos, incurred on an unknown date and referred\nfor collection in April 2004.  Applicant did not realize her family members had not returned the\nvideos, and the accounts were referred for collection.  She paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in July 2007\n(AX E) and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g in October 2007 (AX I; AX CCC).\nThe three collection accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e were for two medical bills for her\ndaughter that were not covered by insurance and a gas bill incurred at her previous residence.  She\nbelieved her children\u2019s medical bills would be covered by Medicaid, but they were not.  Applicant\nwas unaware of these bills until she saw her credit report (Tr. 56).  All three collection accounts were\npaid in full in August 2007 (AX G at 1, 4, 5, 6).  The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f also was a medical\nbill for one of her children.  Applicant contacted the creditor in July 2007 and paid the bill in full in\nSeptember 2007 (AX H).\nApplicant was aware of the delinquent medical debts in SOR \u00b6 1.b for several years.  She\napplied for a home loan in 2006 and was turned down (Tr. 92-93).  She was interviewed about her\ndebts by a security investigator in January 2007 (GX 3 at 8), began contacting her creditors in May\n2007, and was able to make some payment arrangements (Tr. 48).  She paid off several small debts\nbetween July and October 2007.  Her financial breakthrough occurred when her sister told her about\nthe availability of credit counseling services, and she was able to arrange a repayment plan for her\nmedical debts.  \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s husband works for a construction company and was recently promoted to\nsuperintendent.  They have experienced marital problems and lived apart for a while, but they are\nnow reconciled (Tr. 60-61).  She and her husband are now temporarily living apart because he is\nworking on a job out-of-state (Tr. 95).  Her monthly take-home pay is about $3,400, and her\nhusband\u2019s is $3,600 (Tr. 94; AX BB)  She does not have health insurance (Tr. 87).  She owes about\n$16,000 on a car loan (GX 4 at 3).  Her rent and car payments are current (Tr. 34; GX 4 at 3).  In her\npersonal financial statement submitted to the credit counseling agency, she reported a net remainder\nof $659 per month, of which $515 is used for monthly debt payments to the agency (AX C).  She\nknows that the payment plans negotiated by the credit counseling agency will be cancelled if she fails\nto make the monthly $515 payment to them (Tr. 68-69).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCell phone\n$275\nPaid in full, Aug 07\nAX B\n1.b\n30 Medical\ndebts placed for\ncollection\n$23,959\nThree debts paid in full in\nAug 07; paying $515 per\nmonth on remaining debts\nAX C; AX D\n1.c\nOverdue videos\n$215\nPaid in full, Jul 07\nAX E\n1.d\nTwo cell phones\n$805\nPaid in full, Aug 07\nAX G\n1.e\nMedical and gas \n$309\nPaid in full, Aug 07\nAX G\n1.f\nMedical bill\n$161.86\nPaid in full, Sep 07\nAX H\n1.g\nOverdue videos\n$250\nPaid in full, Oct 07\nAX I; AX CCC\n1.h\nStudent loans\n$43,000\nDeferred\nGX 4 at 4-5; AX J;\nAX AA at 18-20\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n\n5\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concern under Guideline F is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or\nintent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there\nis \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nDepartment Counsel conceded that there was no evidence the student loans alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.h were delinquent (Tr. 115-16).  The concession is supported by the evidence of record.\nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and it is resolved in her\nfavor.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e) are raised by the evidence of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f.  Applicant\u2019s credit history reflects her inability to satisfy her debts until recently.  Between\n2001 and 2006, she was incurring medical bills faster than she could repay them.  \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised, because there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending.\nThere is evidence that she was financially naive, negligent, and too trusting when she provided cell\nphones to a friend and her husband, assumed legal responsibility for them, and failed to monitor the\nrecipients\u2019 payments; however, this conduct is not the kind of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending\u201d\ncontemplated by AG \u00b6 19(b).  Her negligence is relevant, however, to the whole person analysis\nrequired by the adjudicative guidelines.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive\nprongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d\nor \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of the\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d\nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established.  Although Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nbegan several years ago, the debts were unresolved until recently.  Her medical debts are not fully\nresolved, because she has just begun a five-year repayment plan.  The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d)\nalso is not established, because Applicant\u2019s financial history reflects numerous delinquent debts.  \nThe third prong (under circumstances unlikely to occur) is established for the medical debts.\nThey were the result of multiple serious medical conditions requiring surgery.   Although she still\nhas no medical insurance, her medical problems are not likely to occur.  \nThe debts for cell phone accounts and unreturned videos are recent, multiple, and could raise\nquestions about her good judgment at the time.  Applicant did not know her children\u2019s medical bills\nwere not covered by Medicaid, but she failed to monitor payment of those bills.  However, Applicant\nappears to have learned from her unwise generosity and lack of attention to her financial liabilities.\nHer meticulous response to DOHA interrogatories, her answer to the SOR, and her recent financial\n\n7\nmanagement reflect attention to detail that previously was lacking.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is\nestablished for the medical debts in SOR \u00b6 1.b but not for the remaining debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c-\n1.f.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nThe medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b were beyond Applicant\u2019s control.  She offered small\nmonthly payments, but they were rejected.  She moved to a new location seeking better employment\nopportunities, found her current job, and continued her education in an effort to improve her\nemployment opportunities.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the medical debts in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant is in a credit counseling program.  She\nhas paid off many smaller debts and has a five-year plan to pay off her medical bills.  She has not\nyet established a track record for her five-year plan, but she has been steadily paying off her other\ndelinquent debts for several months.  I conclude this mitigating condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d). The\nconcept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness,\nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL\n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by\npayment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  \nApplicant contacted her creditors in May 2007, paid off several debts, and has negotiated a\nfive-year payment plan for her medical debts.  Her security clearance application and the ensuing\ninvestigation undoubtedly provided motivation for her to right her financial ship.  However, until\nshe learned about the availability of credit counseling from her sister, she was unaware of the tools\navailable to resolve her situation.  Based on all the evidence, including her sincere and credible\ntestimony at the hearing, I am satisfied that she initiated a good-faith effort to pay her debts out of\na strong sense of obligation as well as her desire to obtain a clearance and a better job.  I conclude\nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \n\n8\nApplicant is a mature adult.  She has worked for years to improve her job skills and become\nqualified for increased responsibility and higher pay.  The delinquent debts arising from the cell\nphone accounts and overdue videos were the product of inattention and naivete.  However, they arose\nwhile Applicant\u2019s life was complicated by illness, marital strife, the turbulence of a family move,\nthe busy schedule of full-time employment and college classes, and sole responsibility for parenting\ntwo adolescent girls.  After Applicant\u2019s home loan application was rejected and she found herself\nunder scrutiny in connection with her security clearance application, she realized aggressive action\nwas needed.  She availed herself of credit counseling when she learned about it from her sister.  She\npresented herself at the hearing as very determined, scrupulously honest, and sincere.  While she has\nnot yet established a track record for her five-year plan to pay off her medical bills, she has been\npaying off other bills for several months.  I am satisfied she has a clear plan to regain financial\nstability, the financial ability to carry out her plan, and the determination to see it through.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:\n  For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school graduate. He has never been married and has no children.2 Applicant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance in 1995 and 1997. In 1998, he was arrested for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. All of the charges were dismissed or otherwise disposed without going to trial. Applicant admitted to the arrests but denied all the charges. He stated he has never used illegal drugs but he had friends that did. Applicant described what led to the arrests in a statement provided for his background investigation on September 18. 2007. He stated the first arrest was for what the police believed were marijuana plants, except that the plants were not marijuana. The second case involved the police searching Applicant\u2019s car. He stated a friend was with him and the friend dropped his cocaine on the floor of the car when the police arrived. The police arrested everybody in the car. Applicant denied knowing that his friend had drugs. He stated the charge was dismissed because it was an unlawful search. He stated the third arrest occurred because someone kept asking Applicant to sell him drugs.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn January 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nJ, Criminal Conduct and Guideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 1, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 14, 2008, and the hearing was convened as \nApril 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nscheduled on April 10, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April \n22, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. Applicant did not object to \nGE 1 through 6 and 8 through 11, and they were admitted. Applicant objected to GE 7, \nwhich is a police report of an alleged sexual assault by Applicant. He objected to the \nadmission of the report because it contained a \u201cmalicious complaint\u201d by the complainant \nand he is denied the right to confront her. I withheld ruling on the exhibit. The Appeal \nBoard has addressed this issue and held that a police report was admissible over an \napplicant\u2019s objection, stating \u201cthe DOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side \nof initially admitting evidence into the record and then to consider a party\u2019s objections \nwhen deciding what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.\u201d1 Applicant\u2019s objection is \noverruled and GE 7 is admitted. I will consider Applicant\u2019s objection when determining \nthe weight to give the document. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through C, which were received without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school \ngraduate. He has never been married and has no children.2  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance in 1995 and \n1997. In 1998, he was arrested for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. All of the \ncharges were dismissed or otherwise disposed without going to trial. Applicant admitted \nto the arrests but denied all the charges. He stated he has never used illegal drugs but \nhe had friends that did. Applicant described what led to the arrests in a statement \nprovided for his background investigation on September 18. 2007. He stated the first \narrest was for what the police believed were marijuana plants, except that the plants \nwere not marijuana. The second case involved the police searching Applicant\u2019s car. He \nstated a friend was with him and the friend dropped his cocaine on the floor of the car \nwhen the police arrived. The police arrested everybody in the car. Applicant denied \nknowing that his friend had drugs. He stated the charge was dismissed because it was \nan unlawful search. He stated the third arrest occurred because someone kept asking \nApplicant to sell him drugs. He wrote that after several months of asking, Applicant sold \nhim tree sap for $40, telling him it was opium. He was arrested for the sale, but the \nmaterial tested negative for controlled substances, and the charge was dismissed.3 \n \n \nIn July 2004, Applicant and a friend took two pieces of equipment from the rear of \na business. He described the incident as \u201cdumpster diving\u201d and the items as two broken \n                                                          \n1 ISCR Case No. 04-12449 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2007). \n \n2 Tr. at 23, 27; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-23; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 3-5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nlasers which were in a scrap pile to be discarded. The police were called and stopped \nthe car after it left the area. The owner of the business asked for the property to be \nreturned. Applicant and his friend returned the items and the police let them go without \nan arrest or charges.4 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in August 2004, and charged with (1) driving under the \ninfluence (DUI); (2) driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or more; (3) hit and run \ndriving causing property damage; and (4) unlawful left turn on divided highway. \nApplicant was driving after drinking and struck two parked cars. The accident had \napparently caused his car to turn around. The car was damaged but operable. He then \ndrove off southbound in the northbound traffic lanes. He drove to an intersection where \nhe was able to turn into the correct lane. A police officer was driving by shortly after the \naccident occurred. He observed a cloud of dust, Applicant\u2019s car facing the wrong way, \nand Applicant\u2019s car driving away. The officer caught up to Applicant\u2019s car and paced it \nfor less than a tenth of a mile, noting that Applicant was driving about 50 miles per hour \nin a 35 zone. He stopped the car, initiated a field sobriety test, and placed Applicant \nunder arrest. Applicant requested a blood test, which indicated a blood alcohol level of \n.170%. In December 2004, Applicant pled guilty to counts (2), (3), and (4). Count (1) \nwas dismissed. He was sentenced to serve ten days incarcerated to be served in the \nweekend work program; probation for three years; ordered to complete a first offender \nalcohol program; his license was restricted for 90 days; and he was ordered to pay \napproximately $1,500 in fines and fees. Applicant admitted to the arrest and conviction. \nIn his September 18, 2007 statement, he wrote that he \u201cdrove about 50 more feet after \nthe accident.\u201d He testified that he did not really agree with the hit and run part of the \ncharges, because his car was \u201cjust a few feet down the road,\u201d but \u201cthat\u2019s what they \nwanted to call it.\u201d5  \n \n \nA girlfriend of one of Applicant\u2019s friends filed a police report in August 2005, \nstating that Applicant had sexually assaulted her in May 2005. The following is a \nsummary of her report. She met Applicant in about March 2005 at a hacking seminar \nand he introduced her to her boyfriend, who had been friends with Applicant since high \nschool. After being out at a show together, the three went to Applicant\u2019s residence at \nabout 2:00 in the morning. Applicant\u2019s roommate said they were making too much noise \nand asked them to move into Applicant\u2019s bedroom. At about 3:45 Applicant asked her if \nshe wanted to take a powder he called \u201c2CB.\u201d She stated that Applicant also had \npsilocybin mushrooms and cocaine in his possession. She took the powder and \u201cpassed \nout completely\u201d shortly thereafter. Over the next six hours she regained consciousness \nintermittently only to lapse back into unconsciousness. During the times she regained \nconsciousness, she remembered seeing Applicant with his mouth on her exposed neck \nand breasts and him rubbing his fully clothed body against her. She discussed the \nincident with her boyfriend the next day. He was also on the bed and saw what she \ndescribed. He prevented Applicant from removing any more of her clothing and from \ntouching her below the waist. He told her that he did not stop it because he thought that \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 25; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3, 6. \n \n5 Tr. at 25-26; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4, 8-11. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nshe and Applicant may also have been dating. She decided to report the incident when \nall three of them were in a hotel room at a conference they were attending and \nApplicant again attempted to fondle her breasts through her clothing as she was lying \non a bed. Her boyfriend walked into the room as this occurred. This incident was \nseveral weeks before she filed the police report. Several months later, she told the \npolice that she did not want Applicant prosecuted and she refused to cooperate further \nin their investigation. The case was closed.6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was in bed with the girl and his friend, and that he \ntouched her breast, but he stated it was fully consensual. He stated that she placed his \nhand on her breast. He denied that he offered her a drug or that he had any drugs at his \nhouse. He stated that she became very mad at him about three months later when he \ncomplained about her driving and she thereafter filed the false report.7 \n \n \nA one-page report dated September 2006, from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation was submitted as GE 2. It listed Applicant\u2019s full name, date of birth (DOB), \nand social security number. It stated: \n \nFBI [city] files contain reference to [Applicant], aka \u201c[nickname],\u201d DOB: \n[Applicant\u2019s DOB], which contain allegations that he is a computer hacker \nwho has gained unauthorized access to computer systems located in [----- \n-----] Library System (--LS) in [state], as well as to the computer system of \na private company resulting in monetary damages. Additional allegations \nwere that [Applicant] and others used computers at [--]LS to gain access \nto computers at the [state] Secretary of State\u2019s Office. These entities \nconfirmed that computer intrusions had in fact occurred. The allegations \nwere made by a subject of a computer intrusion case as well as a system \nadministrator for one of the systems affected. The files do not reflect that \n[Applicant] was ever charged with a crime as a result of the allegations.8 \n \nThe report notes at the bottom as standard language that \u201c[t]his document contains \nneither recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI.\u201d9 \n \n \nApplicant denied ever illegally hacking into any system and specifically denied \nhacking into the Library System and Secretary of State\u2019s Office, as alleged in the FBI \nreport and in the SOR. Applicant described himself as an \u201cethical hacker.\u201d He admitted \nthat he has used the nickname listed as the aka in the FBI report. His job is to hack into \nthe Government\u2019s computer systems with the Government\u2019s permission to test their \n                                                          \n6 GE 7. \n \n7 Tr. at 24, 26; GE 3. \n \n8 GE 2. \n \n9 Id. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nsecurity. He also does volunteer work and has hacked into friend\u2019s systems with their \npermission.10  \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals have been excellent. One appraisal \ncommended him for keeping abreast of industry developments, new hacker techniques, \nand the latest tools to mitigate risks, and noted him as an expert in those areas. The \nGovernment has recognized him for his \u201coutstanding contribution in Information \nSecurity\u201d at the Government facility.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 19, 27-30; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3. \n \n11 AE A-C. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested on three occasions on drug-related charges. He was \nconvicted of driving with his blood alcohol over the limit and hit and run. He was a \nsuspect in a sexual assault case and was stopped by the police after taking equipment \nfrom the rear of a company. Applicant denied all the criminal conduct with the exception \nof driving over the limit. I find there is insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant \ncommitted any of the specific criminal acts other than the conviction for driving over the \nlimit and hit and run. The driving over the limit and hit and run conviction establishes AG \n\u00b6 30(a) and (c) as security concerns. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing his \ncriminal acts. AG \u00b6 32(b) is not applicable. He admitted committing the DUI and denied \nthe remaining allegations. His denials are some evidence that he did not commit the \noffenses. AG \u00b6 32(c) is applicable to all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.e. The DUI and \nhit and run occurred in August 2004, more than three and a half years ago. He has not \nbeen arrested since then and he is well regarded by his employer and its Government \nclient. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) have been raised for consideration. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nSystems is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer \nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication, \ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of \ninformation. \n \n \nApplicant denied committing the acts alleged in the SOR. The only evidence \nsubmitted was a one-paragraph report from the FBI which references allegations made \nby a subject of a computer intrusion case and a system administrator for one of the \nsystems affected. I find that this report is insufficient evidence for the Government to \nsatisfy their burden to present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. The allegations under Guideline M are concluded for Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In August 2004, Applicant was \nintoxicated, drove anyway, and hit two cars. He left the scene of the accident but he \nwas quickly arrested by a police officer. I am concerned that he has not been totally \ncandid about or truly accepted responsibility for the hit and run. He testified that he was \n\u201cjust a few feet down the road,\u201d when that is clearly counter to the eye witness police \nreport and to the offense to which he pled guilty. I am also concerned about the \nprevalence of drug-related incidents in his life. He was arrested three times on drug \ncharges. The alleged victim of the sexual assault also stated that Applicant had drugs. \nHe admitted he had friends that used drugs and that he was driving the car when drugs \nwere found by the police officer. He also admitted that he sold a substance that he told \nthe buyer was an illegal drug. That is at the minimum extremely poor judgment. \nApplicant has the burden of proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him a security clearance. He has consistently put himself in high risk situations \nwhere he was at the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong people. Until he is \ntotally candid and can disassociate himself from those situations and people, I cannot \nfind that he has met his burden of persuasion. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in November 2004 and was granted a discharge of about $1,627,682.18 in debt in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in August 2003 in the approximate amount of $327,890.39 for failure to pay withholding taxes and the debt had not been paid as of May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). At his hearing, Applicant admitted the bankruptcy and tax lien, but contested the amounts of debt discharged and taxes owed. After a thorough review and consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 50-year-old senior product designer, who has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2005. Applicant developed a portable satellite signal receiver capable of supporting top secret information and he seeks a secret-level clearance so that he can gather information in the field to further this and other products designed for the U.S. military. Applicant served in the Army National Guard from July 1978 to July 1988, as a military forward observer in special operations and in winter survival. He held clearances up to the top secret level for his duties in the Guard. In September 1994, Applicant co-founded a product design and development company that had gross sales of 2.6 million and 20 employees at its peak. Applicant was chief architect of the company\u2019s pro",

As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 10, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial considerations) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant\nwhen the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on August 7, 2007, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge. On September 12, 2007, the government moved to amend\nthe SOR to allege: (1) the filing of a bankruptcy (originally SOR \u00b6 1.a) and its discharge (originally\nSOR \u00b6 1.b) as one allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a as amended) and to include in that allegation the amount\nof debt discharged; and (2) to allege as SOR \u00b6 1.b rather than \u00b6 1.c and include the amount of a\nfederal tax lien filed against him in August 2003 for failure to pay withholding taxes.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 19, 2007. On October 4, 2007, I granted the\nmotion and scheduled a hearing for November 8, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Five government\nexhibits (Ex. 1- 5) were admitted, Ex. 3 over Applicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted six exhibits (Ex. A-F), which were admitted without any objections. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition\nin November 2004 and was granted a discharge of about $1,627,682.18 in debt in March 2005 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a), and that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in\nAugust 2003 in the approximate amount of $327,890.39 for failure to pay withholding taxes and the\ndebt had not been paid as of May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). At his hearing, Applicant admitted the\nbankruptcy and tax lien, but contested the amounts of debt discharged and taxes owed.\nAfter a thorough review and consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript,\nI make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior product designer, who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since January 2005. Applicant developed a portable satellite signal receiver capable of\nsupporting top secret information and he seeks a secret-level clearance so that he can gather\ninformation in the field to further this and other products designed for the U.S. military.\nApplicant served in the Army National Guard from July 1978 to July 1988, as a military\nforward observer in special operations and in winter survival. He held clearances up to the top secret\nlevel for his duties in the Guard.\nIn September 1994, Applicant co-founded a product design and development company that\nhad gross sales of 2.6 million and 20 employees at its peak. Applicant was chief architect of the\ncompany\u2019s products, which in the commercial sector included wireless devices, specialized\nelectronic enclosures, invasive medical devices (catheter-type drug delivery system), touch screen\nkiosks, superconductor process machinery, computer peripherals, reconfigurable modular furniture\n\n3\nand ergonomic seating, and yacht building. The company was awarded small business innovative\nresearch grants by NASA in 1999/00 for the creation and design of a hygiene system for astronauts,\nand by the U.S. Navy to design and develop a modular composite cabin for fast attack craft.\nAfter the terrorism acts of September 11, 2001, existing contracts and to his belief guaranteed\nfuture business totaling almost $3 million were cancelled due to government reallocation of funds\nand non passage of funding legislation. The company had a million-dollar payroll at the time and a\ncash crunch. In 2002, the company suffered a loss of about $722,000 from a contract to build a\nmovement tracking device for a sports technology company. Due to enormous design requirements,\nthe product could not be completed within budget, and the company \u201cborrowed\u201d man-hours from\nother jobs for the project. The customer refused to pay for the overcharges and instead required\nApplicant\u2019s company to borrow $500,000 from the customer to complete the project. Applicant\u2019s\ncompany was to repay the debt with the first gross receipts from the finished project. Lacking the\nrevenue to cover employee salaries, vendors, and its federal tax obligations, Applicant decided to\npay his employees\u2019 salaries first and then a small business administration loan (SBA), and to not pay\nstate and federal employee withholding taxes starting with the second quarter of 2002:\nSo we were able to eventually complete the project at a loss, we did end up recouping\nthe $500,000 at that point, and you can see by the nature of the difference in the dates\nthat we were delinquent on our payments, so we made payments as much and as\nquickly as we could. There were specific months where we absolutely could not\nmake payments to the IRS, and those decisions were made because we were\nguaranteed money going forward and on the advice of what used to be a friend, my\naccountant, he suggested that we forego paying some of these and that within a\nmatter of six months we would be able to recoup them, and that was true in certain\ncases and in other cases that was not true.\nIt was a very poor decision on my part to do that. I did that with my business partner,\nI did it with the folks I hired in-house to assist me and my accountant, and we made\nthose in order to not lose my staff. (Tr. 68)\nIn an effort to keep the business going, the employees took a 20 per cent cut in pay, and Applicant\ntook no pay for a few months. He had earned $156,915.52 in 2002, but significantly less in 2003\n($45,570). Employees left on their own accord as they could see the business was failing.\nIn September 2002, Applicant married his current spouse. He had two children from his\nprevious marriage and she had three children. Needing more room, they put an addition on the home\nthat belonged to his spouse before their marriage. In June 2003, Applicant and his spouse took out\na conventional 30-year mortgage loan of $447,800 on the home. Repayment terms were set at $3,443\nper month.\nIn August 2003, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant and his business partner in the\namount of about $327,890. Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds for 2003 and 2004, totaling about\n$15,000 were intercepted and applied toward the debt. Following an offer in compromise by his\n\nThe government alleged a federal tax lien against Applicant in the amount of $327,890.39 (SOR \u00b6 1.a).\n1\nApplicant listed on his bankruptcy petition a federal tax debt of $218,384.16 (Ex. 3, Schedule E). On his SF 86, he listed\nan estimated tax lien of $125,000 (Ex. 1). Available IRS documentation shows he owes $170,945.45 (Ex. D). Applicant\ntestified his business partner entered into an offer in compromise, and paid around $70,000 to settle his debt. (Tr. 102)\nThe $170,945.45 is solely Applicant\u2019s responsibility (\u201cOne [option] was to do as much as possible to pay back the IRS\ndebt first, that\u2019s why the number went from $327,000 down to approximately $200,000, at which time I worked out with\nmy former business partner, who is single with no kids or married with no children, he decided the best thing he was\ngoing to do was to do an offer in compromise, succeeded in doing so and cutting that debt in half, so the debt you see\nhere is actually mine, it\u2019s not split across two people.\u201d Tr. 71).\nApplicant indicated on his SF 86 that he was employed as a freelance product designer from April 2004 to\n2\nJanuary 2005. (Ex. 1) He listed on his bankruptcy petition (Ex. 3)  $41,188 in earnings for 2004, which he now claims\nwas his and his spouse\u2019s joint income (Tr. 116). The bankruptcy was not filed jointly.\nApplicant testified he was told to list his former business partner as a creditor so that he could not file suit\n3\nagainst him in the future. (Tr. 80-81)\n4\nbusiness partner, as of October 2007, Applicant is being held personally liable for past due federal\ntaxes of $154,544.49 for 2002 and $16,400.96 for 2003.1\nAfter speaking with their creditors, include the state tax authority, the IRS, and the bank\nlender of the SBA loan,  Applicant and his business partner determined they should complete\nwhatever contracts they could on their own, and then close down the company and sell assets to\nrepay its obligations. The company ceased operations as a viable entity in September 2003, and was\nformally closed in August 2004. The vendors were paid and state taxes satisfied with the proceeds\nfrom the sale of company assets.\nApplicant was self-employed from April 2004 to January 2005. He billed out at $225 per\nhour for his consulting services. Applicant had household earned income of at least $41,188 and\nunemployment compensation of $11,166 in 2004.2\nIn November 2004, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy seeking discharge of\nconsumer/non-business debts. He listed liabilities totaling $1,846,066.34, but that included\n$218,384.16 in unsecured priority claims owed the IRS for failure to pay employee withholding taxes\nin 2002 and 2003.  Among the unsecured nonpriority claims were the $500,000 loan from the sports\ntechnology company and a $411,384.16 claim by his business partner, both disputed as valid debts\nby Applicant,  and also his and his spouse\u2019s mortgage obligation of $441,046.75 that they continued\n3\nto pay on after the bankruptcy. Consumer credit card obligations totaling $56,501.27 and loan debt\nof $193,000 (including the $123,000 still owed on the SBA loan) were reportedly used for the\nbusiness. Applicant was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in March 2005. The tax debt was\nnot subject to the discharge. \nWith a sizeable mortgage and two children and three stepchildren at home, Applicant was\nnot in a position to repay the tax debt in full. He did not want to negotiate a repayment schedule with\nthe IRS, as the IRS would consider his income and determine a repayment amount from allocation\ntables that would not take into account his particular expenses. An IRS case officer recommended\nto Applicant that he get a job, pay down the debts that he could, and then negotiate an offer in\ncompromise with the IRS. Applicant started his present job in January 2005. In his initial interview\n\n5\nwith the company, Applicant disclosed that he had operated a company that suffered financial\nhardship.\nNeeding a secret clearance for his duties, Applicant executed a questionnaire for sensitive\npositions (SF 86) on January 31, 2006. He disclosed pleasure travel to the United Kingdom in 1999,\nto the Carribean in December 2001, April 2002, and April 2004, and to Bermuda in September 2002\nand August 2003; an April [sic] 2004 bankruptcy filing to resolve business-related debt of $150,000;\nand a federal tax lien of $125,000 on his personal assets filed in March [sic] 2003. He added that he\nwas currently working out an offer in compromise.\nCredit checks of February 28, 2006, and April 24, 2007, reflect the bankruptcy. As of\nFebruary 2006, Applicant was current in his mortgage, but the account had been 30 days past due.\nOpen revolving charge accounts that he held with his spouse were in good standing. As of April\n2007, he had only one outstanding credit card balance, which was in the amount of $600 and rated\nas current. His mortgage balance was $424,000.\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories concerning the IRS debt, Applicant indicated on May\n29, 2007, that he was deferring action on the debt and planned to enter into an offer in compromise\nat a later date. He indicated that on the advice of a case officer, he was not in contact with the IRS.\nApplicant estimated it would be about four years before he was in a financial position to negotiate\nan offer in compromise. Recognizing that the tax lien could jeopardize approval of his clearance,\nApplicant indicated all he could do was to assure that he presents no security risk.\nWith the exception of their honeymoon trip in 2002, which was a gift from his parents,\nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s pleasure trips were paid for by his spouse who withdrew funds from her\n401(k) and/or cashed out some stocks. She also borrowed against her retirement to pay for their\nwedding. Applicant continues to pay his mortgage on time, as reflected in a credit report of\nNovember 7, 2007. He was continuing to rely on consumer credit, owing respective balances of\n$1,366 and $1,369 on revolving charge accounts opened in December 2002 and March 2003. Both\naccounts are rated as current. His children and stepchildren, who range in age from 13 to 19, still live\nat home.\nAs of November 2007, Applicant and his spouse were spending what they take in\n(\u201cfinancially, what goes in goes out\u201d Tr. 84). Every three months, he was withdrawing his 401(k)\nmonies to meet his expenses. Despite an annual salary of $98,700, Applicant had not saved any\nfunds toward entering into an offer in compromise. He has substantial orthodontia expenses, with\none child about to come off braces, two that just started with braces and another about to start. He\nhopes to qualify for a home equity or line of credit that would give him the funds to pay off the IRS.\nApplicant has not contacted the IRS as it would open his case and he fears the IRS would then\ngarnish his wages based on an allocation table.\nApplicant has been dedicated and reliable in his work performance. Company vice presidents\nwho have had the opportunity to work with Applicant appreciate his openness, his strong work ethic,\nand his commitment to the company. The chief financial officer has discussed financial matters,\nworking relationships with suppliers, and best practices. He trusts Applicant \u201cimplicitly.\u201d The\nexecutive vice president has found Applicant to be \u201cconscientious, reliable, and accountable\u201d in\nbudget matters. The facility security officer is aware that Applicant had business-related financial\n\n6\nproblems in the past. He has not witnessed any conduct on Applicant\u2019s part that which cause\nconcerns for Applicant\u2019s ability to access classified information.\n \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18). Applicant was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge\nin March 2005 of debts largely due to a failure of his business in 2002/03. He currently owes the IRS\nmore than $170,000 in delinquent employee withholding taxes that he had a fiduciary responsibility\nto pay quarterly between June 2002 and March 2003. Guideline F disqualifying conditions \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply.\nApplicant had no control over the government\u2019s failure to appropriate funds for contracts that\nApplicant had or anticipated from NASA or the U.S. Navy following the terrorist acts of September\n11, 2001. However, mitigating condition \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances), applies only in mitigation of the bankruptcy. Applicant had\n\n7\ncontrol over the decision that was made to utilize money owed to the federal government in an\nattempt to save his failing company. The government must be assured that those persons granted\naccess can be counted on to fulfill their legal obligations, even if compliance results in personal\nhardship to self or others.\nThe debts discharged in bankruptcy and the IRS debts that were not discharged were\nincurred more than four years ago under circumstances that are not likely to recur (see MC 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment)). Yet, I am unable to apply MC 20 (a) because his decision to withhold payment of\npayroll taxes casts significant doubt about his judgment.\nApplicant remains under significant financial pressure that raises the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress, and he is not likely to resolve the situation in the near future. As\nof November 2007, Applicant had not contacted the IRS about the debt because he did not want the\nIRS to open a new case and assess a repayment amount based on allocation tables that would not\naccount for his high expenses. While he has a good credit rating, he is taking early withdrawals from\nhis 401(k) every few months so that he can meet his expenses. In the past three years, he has not\nsaved any of the funds he needs to approach the IRS with a reasonable offer in compromise. MC\n20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) is not satisfied by waiting for the IRS to intercept his tax refunds.\nWhole-Person Analysis\nUnder the \u201cwhole-person\u201d evaluation required by AG \u00b6 2(a) (The adjudicative process is an\nexamination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the\nperson is an acceptable security risk), Applicant has shown himself to be a valuable contributor to\nhis employer and to the national defense. He held a security clearance for about ten years as a\nmember of the Army National Guard. While the business downturn was central to his decision to\nnot pay the required employee withholding taxes to the IRS, his exercise of poor judgment was not\nlimited to the business, but extended to his personal finances as well. He and his spouse borrowed\nfrom her retirement to take vacations to the Caribbean even in 2004, after the IRS had filed the tax\nlien against him. He continues to put his personal interests ahead of his obligation to repay the tax\ndebt. When he completed his SF 86 in January 2006, he indicated he was \u201ccurrently working out an\noffer in compromise,\u201d but in May 2007 told DOHA that it would be about four years before he\nwould even be in a position to make an offer. Under the totality of the circumstances, I cannot\nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the amended SOR, DOHA alleges under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant has two brothers and one sister who are resident citizens of Pakistan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and one brother and two sisters who are resident citizens of India (SOR \u00b6 1.c). DOHA further alleges that Applicant traveled to India nine times between June 2000 and July 2007, and to Pakistan five times between June 2000 and September 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admits the allegations, explaining that his travel to India and Pakistan was to visit family and/or to attend a wedding. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 50-year-old senior electrical engineer who has worked on the same radar system for a U.S. defense contracting firm since he started his employment in March 1985 (Ex. 1, Tr. 93). He held a confidential security clearance from 1985 until 1995 when it was upgraded to secret (Tr. 117-18). He has complied with his security responsibilities (Ex. C, Ex. D, Tr. 61, 98). For about a year from July 2006, Applicant had collateral duties as the Information Systems Security Officer for his area (Ex. C, Tr. 99-101). He was selected for the position by his supervisor and company security personnel (Ex. 100). He received additional security training (Ex. P, Tr. 127) for his duties, which included monitoring access and weekly network audits (Tr. 61, 100). Applicant is the youngest of nine children (five sons and four daughters) born in P",

Coyne, Esq.; Joseph Devlin, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 26, 2006, in renewal of his secret clearance. On January 24,\n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B that\nprovided the basis for its action to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to\nan administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 8, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me, and on April 18,\n2008, I scheduled a hearing for May 9, 2008. On May 7, 2008, Applicant, acting pro se,\nJuly 24, 2008\n\nSee U.S. Department of State's publications:  Pakistan's Fata Challenge:  Securing One of the World's Most\n1\nDangerous Areas, reporting the May 20, 2008, testimony of John Negroponte, Deputy Secretary of State, and\nA New Strategy for Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan, reporting the June 25, 2008, testimony of Richard\nA. Boucher, Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs.\n2\nrequested a brief continuance that was granted without any objection from the\ngovernment. On May 21, 2008, I rescheduled the hearing for June 27, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled on June 27, 2008. Two government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-2) and 16 Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-P) were admitted and Applicant and two\ncoworkers testified on his behalf. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received by\nDOHA on July 8, 2008. Based on review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, and the facts for administrative notice, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn April 16, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to Pakistan and to India. The request was based on publications\nfrom the U.S. State Department, the Congressional Research Service, the Director of\nNational Intelligence, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce. The government\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not\nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record. \nOn April 24, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. The parties were informed that any objections would\nbe taken up at the hearing. Before the introduction of any evidence on June 27, 2008, I\nconfirmed the parties had no objections, although counsel for Applicant expressed\nconcerns about the relevance of some of the facts. I agreed to take administrative\nnotice of facts pertaining to Pakistan and to India. At Applicant\u2019s request, I also agreed\nto take notice of provisions of the National Industrial Security Program Operating\nManual (DoD 5220.22-M) dated February 28, 2006, in assessing Applicant\u2019s record of\nsecurity compliance.\nOn July 11, 2008, I informed the parties that consistent with DOHA Appeal Board\nrulings stressing consideration of the most current political conditions in foreign\ncountries when evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292, Apr.\n12, 2007), I intended to review for purposes of taking administrative notice recent\ntestimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee by high-ranking U.S.\nState Department officials concerning U.S.-Pakistan relations.  The parties filed no\n1\nobjections by the July 21, 2008, deadline for comment.\n\nFor ease of reference, his siblings are identified by number and gender starting with the eldest brother as\n2\nbrother #1 and the eldest sister as sister #1.\n3\nMotion to Amend SOR\nApplicant was granted a continuance of his hearing for time to prepare his case\ngiven his very then recent return from India for his sister\u2019s funeral. Before presenting\nany evidence on June 27, 2008, the government withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.b alleging the\nPakistani citizenship and Indian residency of Applicant\u2019s sister in light of her death.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleges under Guideline B, foreign influence, that\nApplicant has two brothers and one sister who are resident citizens of Pakistan (SOR \u00b6\n1.a), and one brother and two sisters who are resident citizens of India (SOR \u00b6 1.c).\nDOHA further alleges that Applicant traveled to India nine times between June 2000\nand July 2007, and to Pakistan five times between June 2000 and September 2005\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admits the allegations, explaining that his travel to India and\nPakistan was to visit family and/or to attend a wedding. After considering the evidence\nof record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior electrical engineer who has worked on the same\nradar system for a U.S. defense contracting firm since he started his employment in\nMarch 1985 (Ex. 1, Tr. 93). He held a confidential security clearance from 1985 until\n1995 when it was upgraded to secret (Tr. 117-18). He has complied with his security\nresponsibilities (Ex. C, Ex. D, Tr. 61, 98). For about a year from July 2006, Applicant\nhad collateral duties as the Information Systems Security Officer for his area (Ex. C, Tr.\n99-101). He was selected for the position by his supervisor and company security\npersonnel (Ex. 100). He received additional security training (Ex. P, Tr. 127) for his\nduties, which included monitoring access and weekly network audits (Tr. 61, 100).\n Applicant is the youngest of nine children (five sons and four daughters) born in\nPakistan to resident citizens of that country (Ex. 1).  Brother #1, who is now 71,\n2\nimmigrated to the United States and became naturalized in November 1977 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n89. Two sisters (sisters #2 and #3) had married and immigrated to India before\nApplicant's birth (Tr. 107, 145-46).\nApplicant found it difficult growing up as a Hindu in an overwhelmingly Muslim\ncountry (Tr. 86). Under the sponsorship of brother #1, Applicant immigrated to the U.S.\nfrom Pakistan in March 1979. He began part-time college studies the following month.\nFrom September 1979 to June 1983, he pursued full-time undergraduate study, and\nearned his degree in electrical engineering (Tr. 86).\n\nAlthough Applicant and his spouse knew one another beforehand, Applicant's mother arranged the marriage\n3\n(Tr. 131-32). \nThe U.S. State Department strongly discourages travel to the city where brother #4 resides, due to recurring\n4\nviolence characterized by random bombings, shootings, and kidnapping for ransom. Americans and other\nW esterners continue to be targets of hostility, including anti-W estern mob violence, in the area. See Country\nSpecific Information\u2013Pakistan, dated September 27, 2007.\n4\nIn August 1982, Applicant married his spouse in Pakistan (Tr. 86, 132-33).  A\n3\nnative of Pakistan, she immigrated to the U.S. in March 1983 (Tr. 132). In October\n1984, they had the first of their two sons. The younger was born in January 1988 (Ex. 1,\nEx. B). Both sons were born in the U.S. and remain U.S. citizens (Ex. 1).\nAs soon as he was eligible, Applicant applied for U.S. citizenship, and he became\nnaturalized in January 1985 (Ex. 1, Tr. 86). Applicant renounced his Pakistani\ncitizenship on acquiring his U.S. citizenship (Tr. 87), and he obtained his U.S. passport.\nHis most recent U.S. passport was issued to him in late August 2004 (Ex. 1). Applicant's\nspouse is a dual citizen of Pakistan and the U.S.  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen\nin August 1996 (Ex. 1).\nAfter he earned his degree, Applicant worked in the computer industry for about\na year (Tr. 128) until March 1985 when he started with his present employer. In July\n1987, Applicant and his spouse moved to the community where they still maintain their\nresidence (Ex. 1, Tr. 84). In March 1988, Applicant and his nephew (brother #1's son)\nopened a jewelry store business in the town. In the articles of organization\n(incorporation) Applicant is listed as director and treasurer, his nephew as director and\npresident, and Applicant's spouse as secretary (Ex. E). Applicant's spouse continues to\nwork full-time at that location (Ex. E, Tr. 120-21). In April 1999, they expanded the\nbusiness by opening a second store in another locale where his nephew and his\nnephew's spouse conduct the operations (Ex. H, Tr. 121). Applicant and his nephew\ncontribute through their business to local community service organizations (Ex. F).\nApplicant is an active member of an ethnic cultural/religious organization in his area (Ex.\nJ).\nApplicant and his spouse bought their present home in July 1998 (Ex. 1, Tr. 84).\nTheir two sons excelled academically in the local public schools, and both were active in\nschool activities. After high school, they went on to the same polytechnic university in\nthe U.S. Since earning his bachelor's degree in 2006, the elder son has worked as an\nengineer for Applicant's employer at a different facility (Ex. A, Tr. 89-90). The younger\nson just completed his junior year in college with a cumulative grade point average of\n3.47. He is pursuing a double major; in computer and systems engineering, and in\nelectrical engineering (Ex. B, Tr. 90-91).\nTwo of Applicant's brothers are lifelong resident citizens of southern Pakistan.4\nBrother #2 served within the Pakistani government as an appointed representative of\nminority affairs from November 1988 to October 1999. For about two years from\nSeptember 2006, he was an advisor at the state level on minority issues. He was\n\n5\nreappointed in 2008 to again serve as minority affairs representative at the national\nlevel (Ex. 2, Tr. 156). Brother #4 is a physician in general practice in Pakistan. He has\nthree children, including a son who resides in the U.S. His daughter is married and living\nin the United Arab Emirates (UAE). His youngest child is still a minor. (Tr. 141-42).\nBrother #3 moved from Pakistan to India in about 1981, and he acquired Indian\ncitizenship. To Applicant's understanding, brother #3 owns rental property in India.\nBrother #3 has two sons who live in the U.S. and India, respectively (Tr. 144).\nSister #1 lived in Pakistan until about 2003 when she moved to India to be near\nher adopted son. She remained solely a Pakistani citizen, and traveled back to Pakistan\non occasion when her health permitted it (Tr. 110, 133). Some 25 years older than\nApplicant (Ex. 1, Ex. K), she was \"like a mother to him\" and he telephoned her every\nSaturday (Tr. 105). She died in April 2008 (Ex. K).\nSisters #2 and #3 are longtime resident citizens of India, sister #2 since before\n1947 (Tr. 107) and sister #3 since 1951 (Tr. 146). Neither sister worked outside of the\nhome. Sister #2's spouse owned a business before he retired (Tr. 145-46). Sister #3\nhas one son who is involved in stock trading in India (Tr. 147). Sister #4 in order of birth\ndied before Applicant completed his September 2006 e-QIP (Ex. 1). Sister #5 has been\na lifelong resident citizen of Pakistan. She is married to a landlord and has grown\nchildren (Tr. 142-43).\nApplicant had weekly telephone contact with sister #1 before her death. As of\nJuly 2007, the frequency of telephone contact with brothers #2 and #3 was every three\nweeks, with brother #4 every two weeks, with sisters #2 and #3 about once a month,\nand with sister #5 from once every three months to once monthly (Ex. 2, Tr. 137, 143,\n147). \nApplicant traveled back to Pakistan and to India to see his family after he\nimmigrated to the U.S. Before his mother died in 1990, he went to Pakistan every two or\nthree years (Tr. 111). Since 1990, his trips have been no longer than two or three weeks\nin duration, and primarily to see sister #1 with whom he had a particularly close\nrelationship. About 80 percent of his trips were to see sister #1, whether she was in\nPakistan or India (Tr. 103-05), although he also visited with his other siblings. He stayed\nwith brother #4 when in Pakistan and with brother #3 when in India (Tr. 153-54). He\ntraveled to India and Pakistan from June to July 2000, and again in July 2001. While on\nbusiness trips for his employer to Kuwait in December 2001 and January 2002, he\nspent a few days in India. He took advantage of another business trip to Kuwait in\nJanuary 2003, and spent seven days visiting those family members in Pakistan. Over\nthe January/February 2004 time frame, he spent 20 days in India, but also stopped in\nPakistan to see his other siblings. In November 2004, Applicant traveled with his spouse\nand children to India for the wedding of a nephew (a son of brother #3, Tr. 162).\nApplicant spent 13 days in Pakistan in September/October 2005, eight days in India in\nMarch 2006, and ten days in India in July 2006. He and his immediate family vacationed\nto India in July 2007 (Tr. 163). (Ex. 1, Answer). Applicant traveled to India at least twice\n\n6\nin 2008 when sister #1 was hospitalized, and he was there on her death in April 2008\n(Tr. 147-48, Ex. K). His siblings in Pakistan came to India for the funeral (Tr. 144) so\nApplicant saw them as well. Applicant has not contacted his siblings in India or Pakistan\nsince his sister's funeral, although sister #1's son and brother #4 called him to ask how\nhe was doing (Tr. 148, 161).\nWith the death of his beloved sister, Applicant no longer has the same desire to\ntravel to India or Pakistan. He recently went to the security office at work and offered to\nturn in his U.S. passport so that it would be available to him only for business travel.\nThe security office refused to accept it (Tr. 149).\nBrothers #2 and #4 come to the U.S. once every two to four years to visit their\nsons. Applicant sees them at least once for dinner when they are in the U.S. (Tr. 140,\n161). His brothers are aware that he works for a U.S. defense contractor (Tr. 156).\nApplicant's spouse's three siblings are citizens of Pakistan. Her brother lives in\nthe United Arab Emirates where he is employed in the food service business (Tr. 152-\n53). Applicant took advantage of flight stopovers during his trips to the region in June\n2000, July 2001, January 2002, January 2004, September 2005, and July 2007 and\nvisited with his brother-in-law in the UAE (Ex. 1, Ex. 2). Applicant otherwise has\ntelephone contact with him about once every six months (Ex. 2), although his spouse\ncalls her brother every three or four weeks (Tr. 152). Applicant's spouse's sisters reside\nin Pakistan. Applicant believes they do not work outside of the home (Tr. 150). He last\nsaw them in person when in Pakistan in September 2005, and his telephone contact\nwith them is no more frequent than once very six months (Ex. 2). His spouse calls her\nsisters once a month (Tr. 151).\nApplicant has no financial interests in either India or Pakistan (Tr. 112). He does\nnot send any financial support to his or his spouse's relatives abroad (Tr. 155).\nAs the lead engineer in a testing area that utilizes classified software, Applicant\nhas consistently met his work commitments, including compliance with security\nprocedures. He has been called on by his employer to travel overseas to train and\nsupport foreign customers and to troubleshoot problems with the radar system that he\nhas focused on throughout his career with the defense contractor. He exceeded his\ndepartment's training requirements for 2007 (Ex. C). Applicant's professionalism and\nconscientious work in support of production integration and testing of the radar system\nhave brought the respect of his coworkers and the test community. He is considered to\nbe an integral member of the radar test team and a valuable asset to his employer (Ex.\nD).\nAfter review of U.S. government publications concerning Pakistan and India and\ntheir respective relations with the U.S., I take administrative notice of the following facts:\n\n7\nPakistan\nPakistan is a parliamentary democracy that has maintained diplomatic relations\nwith the U.S. since 1947. U.S. military aid to Pakistan has been suspended at times due\nto concerns about Pakistan\u2019s program to develop nuclear weapons. Pakistan has been\nimplicated in the sale of nuclear technology to third countries, including to North Korea.\nPervez Musharraf, then Army Chief General, became Pakistan\u2019s chief of state following\na military coup in October 1999.  The overthrow of a democratically elected government\ntriggered an additional layer of sanctions by the U.S., including restrictions on foreign\nmilitary financing and economic assistance to Pakistan other than refugee and counter-\nnarcotics assistance. The U.S.-Pakistan relationship changed significantly after\nSeptember 11, 2001. Under President Musharraf, Pakistan pledged to support the U.S.\ncampaign to eliminate the Taliban in Afghanistan, and to provide extensive support on\nthe war on terrorism.  Pakistan has captured more than 600 al-Qaida members and its\nsupporters, and afforded the U.S. unprecedented levels of cooperation by allowing the\nU.S. military to use bases within Pakistan, helping to identify and detain extremists,\ntightening its border with Afghanistan, and blocking terrorist financing. The U.S.\nresumed military aid, increased economic assistance, and provided debt relief to\nPakistan, making Pakistan among the world\u2019s leading recipients of U.S. aid since 2001.\nIn 2004, the U.S. recognized closer bilateral ties with Pakistan by designating Pakistan\nas a major non-NATO ally. Serious political crises in Pakistan in 2007, culminating in the\nassassination of former prime minister and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in\nDecember 2007, severely undermined the status of the military-dominated Musharraf\ngovernment, and it led to President Musharraf retiring from the army and taking the\npresidential oath of office as a civilian. Since parliamentary elections in February 2008,\nPakistan has been under the rule of a more moderate civilian government. The U.S.\nremains committed to pursuing a long-term comprehensive partnership with Pakistan.\nAlthough considered a \u201cfrontline partner\u201d in the war on terror, Pakistan remains a\nmajor source of Islamic extremism. Pakistan\u2019s western tribal areas provide sanctuary for\nTaliban and al-Qaida extremists and insurgent activity. A number of extremist groups\nwithin Pakistan continue to target American and other Western interests, high-level\nPakistani government officials, as well as members of minority indigenous and religious\ngroups. Anti-American sentiment is high among some Islamists in Pakistan. The\nDepartment of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against nonessential travel to\nPakistan in light of the threat of terrorist activity, including to the province where\nApplicant's brothers #2 and #4 and sister #5 reside.\nThe human rights situation in Pakistan worsened in 2007, stemming in part from\nPresident Musharraf\u2019s decision to impose a state of emergency suspending basic civil\nliberties, including freedom of speech and assembly. While the state of emergency was\nlifted in December 2007, about a dozen of the more than 6,000 activists detained during\nthe 42-day state of emergency were still under house arrest. Regulatory restrictions\ncontinued on the press and freedom of assembly. Other reported human rights\nproblems included restrictions on the citizens\u2019 right to change their government,\nextrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest,\n\n8\nlack of judicial independence, widespread corruption and trafficking in persons, and\nfailure to discipline and prosecute those persons responsible for abuses.\nIndia\nIndia is a stable multiparty federal democratic republic with a bicameral\nparliament. The central government has broad administrative powers in relation to its\nstates. Indian society and political organization are determined largely by the Hindu\ncaste system of occupational and social hierarchies, by religion, and language, although\nthe influence of these factors has been diluted if not subsumed in the economically\nprosperous and heterogeneous cities. The Indian government generally respected the\nrights of its citizens in 2007, although serious problems persisted, in part because of a\nlack of accountability in the government and security forces and lax enforcement of the\nhuman rights laws. Human rights abuses included the extrajudicial killing of persons in\ncustody, disappearances, torture, rape by police and security forces, poor prison\nconditions, prolonged detention, excessive force in combating terrorism and regional\ninsurgencies, endemic corruption in the government and police forces, restrictions on\ntravel of visiting experts and scholars, caste-based discrimination, and domestic\nviolence and other abuses against women and children. Human rights abuses and\nterrorist acts have been committed in recent years, including in 2007, by separatist\nguerillas, Maoist insurgents from Nepal, and other terrorists within India.\nLong an active member of the United Nations, India remains a leader in the\ndeveloping world. It has a long tradition of participating in U.N. peacekeeping\noperations. The U.S. recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to\nstrengthen its relationship with India, especially since 2004. Both countries are\ncommitted to political freedom protected by representative government, and share\ncommon interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting terrorism, and in creating a\nstrategically stable Asia. Differences over India\u2019s nuclear weapons programs and pace\nof economic reform exist but the U.S. is committed to continuing a strong, dynamic\npartnership with India. In June 2005, the U.S. and India signed a ten-year defense pact\noutlining planned collaboration in multilateral operations, expanded two way defense\ntrade and increasing technology transfer opportunities. In July 2007, the U.S. and India\nreached a historic milestone in their strategic partnership by completing negotiations on\na bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation.\nIndia and Pakistan have been tense rivals, largely over Kashmir, since the\npartition of the subcontinent on independence in 1947. Both India and Pakistan have\nlarge defense establishments, including nuclear weapons capability and ballistic missile\nprograms, at the cost of economic and social development. The U.S. strongly\nencourages an ongoing India-Pakistan peace initiative and remains concerned about\nthe potential for conflict over Kashmiri sovereignty and \u201ccross-border terrorism.\u201d India\nhas traditionally positive relations with Iran and India is ranked tenth among\ninternational investors in Iran. India is fully committed to the construction of a gas\npipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan despite U.S. strong\nopposition.\n\n9\nIndia is undergoing rapid economic expansion, although bureaucracy and lack of\ninfrastructure present obstacles to growth. The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner\nand its largest investment partner. The U.S. strongly supports the market reforms\nundertaken by India since 1991 and urges further liberalization of trade and investment\nbarriers. Indian enterprises have aggressively pursued acquisition of U.S. restricted,\ndual use technology in violation of U.S. export controls.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n10\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant admits he had a very close relationship with his eldest sister (\"number\none\" in terms of his affections, Tr. 106). He called her every Saturday, and visited with\nher during most of his trips to Pakistan and/or India, often arranging his travel to\ncoincide with her whereabouts. He has never shared that same closeness with his other\nsiblings, but it is clear that he has ongoing relationships with them. He stayed with\nbrother #3 and visited with sisters #2 and #3 when in India. When in Pakistan, he stayed\nwith brother #4 and visited with brother #2 and sister #5. As of July 2007, he had regular\ntelephone contact with his siblings with the exception of sister #5, whom he called once\na month to once every three months. Although he has not telephoned his siblings since\nsister #1's funeral in May 2008, brother #4 called him from Pakistan to check on his\nwell-being. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d) applies because of his bonds with his siblings, who are resident\ncitizens of India, a country known to target U.S. economic intelligence, and Pakistan, a\ncountry associated with a risk of terrorism and anti-Western violence.\nMoreover, AG 7(b) (\"connections to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information\") is also implicated because of\nbrother #2's position within the Pakistani government as an appointed representative of\n\nApplicant testified to not knowing much about his brother's position or duties (Tr. 159) but also that he\n5\nbelieves there are 10 or 11 minority members (Tr. 164).\n11\nminority affairs. Even if Applicant's brother is only one of several such representatives,5\nhis affiliation with the national government from November 1988 to October 1999 and\nmore recently since his reappointment in 2008, heightens the risk because of his\nongoing contacts with other governmental officials. Brother #2 also served as an advisor\nto the provincial government from September 2006 to 2008, so it may be inferred that\nhe holds some position of prominence within his local community in Pakistan as well.\nApplicant's spouse contacts her sisters, who are resident citizens of Pakistan,\nabout once a month. She and Applicant visit them when in Pakistan. She also contacts\nher brother who lives in the U.A.E., and Applicant has made the effort to see his\nbrother-in-law several times when en route to or from India or Pakistan. A risk of undue\nforeign influence may be heightened through a spouse\u2019s foreign ties (see AG \u00b6 7(d)\n(\"sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion\")). However, the government did not allege any concerns because of his\nspouse\u2019s relationships with her siblings. Nothing about their occupations likely heightens\nthe risk. Her sisters do not work outside the home, and her brother is employed in the\nfood business as a wholesaler.\nThe government alleged separate foreign influence concerns because of\nApplicant\u2019s frequent travel to Pakistan and India. Applicant made about 14 separate\ntrips to the region to see his relatives between June 2000 and April 2008. On a couple\nof occasions, he took advantage of scheduled business travel to Kuwait and spent a few\ndays with some of his siblings. AG \u00b6 7(i) applies where there is \u201cconduct, especially\nwhile traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country.\u201d\nThere is no evidence of conduct that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i). The primary relevance\nof his foreign travel is that it confirms the close relationship with his siblings, which is\nmore appropriately covered under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d) is difficult to satisfy. Pakistan\nis allied with the U.S. in fighting terrorism and insurgent activity in the region, and it is\nnot known to actively target U.S. sensitive information. However, it has not been fully\nsuccessful in stemming the exploitation of its rugged tribal areas by terrorists and violent\nextremists for recruitment and safehaven. American and Western interests have been\ntargeted in the region where Applicant's siblings live. In light of brother #2's\ngovernmental position, there exists the potential for Applicant's family members in\nPakistan being taken hostage or otherwise pressured or influenced. Pakistan has a poor\nhuman rights record, including of arbitrary arrest and discrimination against religious\n\n12\nminorities. It remains to be seen whether the human rights situation will improve\nsignificantly in Pakistan under the new democratically elected government. The death of\nthe sibling Applicant held in closest affection reduces, but does not completely\neliminate, the risk of undue foreign influence.\nIn contrast, although some serious problems persist, the Indian government\ngenerally respects the human rights of its citizens. While a number of anti-Western\nterrorist groups are believed to be active in India, the risk faced by his relatives is that\nthey may become indiscriminate victims of a violent terrorist act like a bombing on\npublic transport. India has a history of targeting U.S. sensitive information, and Indian\ncompanies continue to pursue acquisition of dual use technology in violation of export\nrestrictions. However, there is nothing about the endeavors of brother #3 or sisters #2\nand #3 that have any military, intelligence, security, or even economic implications, and\nthey are not likely to be targeted. Sisters #2 and #3 are 73 and 65 years old, have lived\nin India for more than 50 years, and never worked outside of the home. Brother #3\nknows Applicant works for a defense contractor, but he is by occupation a landlord in\none of India's largest cities. He is not in a situation where he is likely to be pressured by\nthe Indian government or other entity seeking U.S. classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence because of his relationships\nwith his siblings, especially those in Pakistan, may nonetheless be mitigated by deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d)). Applicant\u2019s\nactions show a primary loyalty to the U.S., where he has established roots since joining\nhis oldest brother here in 1979. Although he went home to Pakistan to enter into a\nmarriage arranged by his mother, he brought his spouse to the U.S. As soon as he was\neligible, he applied for his U.S. citizenship. He and his spouse became naturalized U.S.\ncitizens in 1985 and 1996, respectively. On his U.S. naturalization in 1985, Applicant\nrelinquished his Pakistani citizenship. His travels to India and Pakistan to see his\nsiblings have been as a U.S. citizen on a U.S. passport. He has lived in the same\ncommunity in the U.S. for more than 20 years. His two sons were born in the U.S. and\nremain U.S. citizens. They attended the local public schools before they went on to a\nprivate technological university in the U.S. All of his financial assets are in the U.S. In\naddition to owning his home, Applicant has been part-owner since 1988 of a jewelry\nbusiness that serves as his spouse's primary employer. With the very recent death of\nsister #1, Applicant testified credibly that he no longer has the desire to travel to\nPakistan or India to see his siblings. He tried without success to have his employer hold\nhis U.S. passport to prove that he would travel only on business.\nHis contributions to his employer and his proven track record of complying with\nsecurity regulations are as significant as are his U.S. ties in assessing whether he can\nbe counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\u2019 interests. Applicant has been\nwith the same defense contractor for the past 23 years. The government trusted\n\n13\nApplicant with classified information during the time that his brother #2 represented\nminority interests with the Pakistani government from 1988 to 1999, and Applicant did\nnot violate his fiduciary duty. Moreover, his employer trusted him with the additional\nresponsibilities of the ISSO when brother #2 was an adviser at the state/regional level.\nA coworker familiar with Applicant's work since 1988, and with the manner in which\nApplicant fulfilled his duties as ISSO, described Applicant\u2019s protection of secure\ninformation as \"[p]robably at the utmost, the highest level.\"  (Tr. 61). Coworkers attest to\nApplicant being a professional, ethical employee well-regarded by his colleagues and by\nthe test community (Ex. D). Applicant has shown for the past 23 years that he can be\ncounted on to comply with his security obligations when the risk of undue foreign\ninfluence was greater then than it is now that his beloved sister has died and Pakistan\nand India have strengthened their ties to the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family\nmember and the interests of the U.S. Applicant maintains relationships with his siblings\nwho reside in Pakistan and India. Pakistan has a poor human rights record, and\nAmerican interests have been targeted by violent extremists and insurgents in the\nregion where his siblings reside. India has a record of targeting U.S. sensitive and\nprotected technology information. At the same time, the U.S. considers both countries\nas key to its strategic interests, and both Pakistan and India enjoy good relations with\nthe U.S. Pakistan has been a key ally in the war against terrorism.\n\n14\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns over undue foreign influence. As\nnoted under Guideline B, supra, he has spent the last 29 years establishing roots in the\nU.S. He has no affinity for his native Pakistan, given the discrimination he felt during his\nyouth as a member of a minority religion. His ties to India and Pakistan are solely to his\nsiblings, and he testified credibly to his contact with them becoming less frequent after\nthe death of sister #1, who made the effort to maintain the family ties. By all accounts,\nApplicant is an ethical person, who has a strong sense of obligation to his immediate\nfamily in the U.S. and to his employer. He has been trusted with classified information\nsince 1985 and has not violated that trust. Based on the record before me, It is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 9, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on September 21, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nNovember 16, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 22, 2009.\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit A, which was also admitted\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on January 5, 2010.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of\nApplicant, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b. and 1.c., and he denied\n1.a., under Guideline J. He denied allegation 2.b., and did not respond in his RSOR to\n2.a., under Guideline E. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. Department Counsel also moved to amend the SOR to add three additional\nallegations under Guideline J, and they will be reviewed below, when discussing\nGuideline J. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. He is married, and he has four children. Applicant\nworks for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection\nwith his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct. The SOR lists two allegations\nunder Adjudicative Guideline J, and they will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. The SOR alleges that in approximately 2003, Applicant was \u201carrested for (1)\nPossession of Less than 1 oz. Marijuana and (2) Possession of Switch-Blade knife.\u201d At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that on the day of the incident, at the request of a former\nco-worker,  Applicant was driving home this individual, when he was stopped by the\npolice for playing loud music in his car and having something large hanging from his\nmirror. (Tr at 72.) After he was pulled over, Applicant stated that the police officer found\nmarijuana in Applicant\u2019s vehicle, which, according to Applicant, belonged to his\npassenger. Applicant claimed that he had not used the marijuana, nor did it belong to\nhim. The police officer thereafter found a switch-blade knife in his trunk. Applicant\nclaimed that the vehicle was one he had recently purchased, the knife was not his, and\nhe was not aware that the knife was in his car. (Tr at 37-43).\nUltimately, Applicant plead guilty to count 2, Possession of Switch-Blade knife,\nand Count 1, Possession of Less than 1 oz. Marijuana, was dismissed. He was ordered\nto pay a fine, which he believed to be $150, and he was also ordered to serve 10 days\nof public service. (Tr at 43-44.) Exhibit 3 confirms that Applicant was ordered to serve\n10 days of community service and pay a fine of $155.  He also served 24 months of\nprobation. Finally, Applicant followed his employer\u2019s requirements by notifying the\ncompany of this arrest. (Tr at 90.) \n\n3\n1.b. The SOR alleges that in approximately 2005, Applicant was cited for \u201c(1)\nPossession of Under 1 oz. Marijuana.\u201d In his testimony, Applicant admitted this\nallegation. He stated that in 2005, he was stopped by the police for driving his vehicle\nthrough a red light, and he was cited for possession of marijuana. He testified that he\nplead guilty to the possession of marijuana charge, and he was ordered to pay a fine\nand attend classes. He thought he paid the fine, which he believed to be either $300 or\n$400, but he could not recall if he attended all 24 classes as was ordered by the court.\n(Tr at 48-54.) Upon cross examination by Department Counsel, Applicant concurred that\nhis fine was $1,000, and that since he could not afford to pay it at that time, he accepted\nthe alternative punishment of serving time in jail. He was initially sentenced to serve 30\ndays, but he was released after seven days for good behavior. (Tr at 79.)\nApplicant stated that after he got laid off from his work, he was having a difficult\ntime, so he used marijuana, once a day, for approximately three or four weeks, to help\nhim cope with his problems. Applicant testified that he has not used marijuana since\nthat incident in 2005, and he has no intention to use any illegal drug in the future. (Tr at\n54-55.)\nAs stated above, at the hearing Applicant moved to amend the SOR and add\nthree additional allegations, 1.c. through 1.e., under Guideline J. They will be reviewed\nbelow:\n1.c.  This allegation states that in approximately March 1996, Applicant was\narrested for \u201cPossession of Narcotic Controlled Substance.\u201d At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that he was not arrested in 1996 for drug possession, and that this allegation is\nincorrect. (Tr at 59-60.)\n 1.d. This allegation states that in approximately December 2007, Applicant was\narrested for \u201cPossession of a switchblade knife.\u201d Applicant testified that he was not\narrested in 2007 for possession of a switchblade knife, and that this allegation is not\ncorrect. (Tr at 60-61.)\n1.e. This allegation states that in approximately November 2008, Applicant was\narrested for \u201cPossession of Controlled Substance.\u201d Applicant testified that he was not\narrested in 2008 for drug possession, and that this allegation is incorrect. (Tr at 61-63.)\nThe Government based allegations 1.c. through 1.e., on Exhibit 9, which is an\nFBI criminal report (rap sheet) that allegedly includes all of the criminal activity of\nApplicant. However, during his testimony, Applicant pointed out several discrepancies\nwith the physical description of the person in Exhibit 9. Exhibit 9 states that the\nindividual is white with brown eyes, six feet tall and weighing 165 pounds. Applicant\nnoted that he is Hispanic with blue eyes, six feet two inches tall and weighing 380\npounds. Exhibit 9 also lists two different social security numbers and states that the\nindividual has a tattoo on his left forearm, while Applicant has tattoos on both arms.\nApplicant argued that the individual, who is the subject of Exhibit 9, is clearly not him.\n(Tr at 64-65.) While I did rule at the hearing to allow the SOR to be amended in the\nmanner requested by Department Counsel, adding allegations 1.c. through 1.e., I do not\n\n4\nfind that the Government\u2019s burden has been met in establishing these allegations.\nApplicant testified credibly that he was not involved in any of these criminal activities.\nThe Government relied solely on Exhibit 9, which as reviewed above, had many\nsignificant errors in identification. Therefore, I do not find Exhibit 9 to be reliable as a\nsole means to establish these allegations. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s conduct, that is the basis for 1.a. and 1.b.,\nabove, shows questionable judgement, lack of candor, dishonesty or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations.\n2.b. The SOR alleges that \u201cin approximately 2003, [Applicant] associated with a\nmember of [a street gang.]\u201d Applicant testified that he knew this individual, because they\nhad previously worked together at a department store. Applicant knew this person was\na gang member because of his tattoos, but he averred that he had no gang contacts\nwith this individual or with any other person. Also, Applicant never participated in any\ngang activity, nor was he ever a member of any gang. (Tr at 55-57.)  Applicant never\nsaw this individual again after the arrest in 2003. (Tr at 74.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted 13 very positive character letters from individuals who have\nknown him in his professional or personal capacities. (Exhibit A.) His previous\nsupervisor described him as a \u201cdependable, reliable, hard-working, conscientious,\nhonest, peace-loving, courteous man.\u201d \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nRegarding the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I find that AG \u00b6 31(a) applies, \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d because of Appellant\u2019s possession of marijuana in 2005, and his guilty plea\nto possession of a switchblade knife in 2003.  As reviewed above, I do not find that the\nGovernment has established that Applicant engaged in the criminal activity, as alleged\nin 1.c. through 1.e. \nUnder the mitigating conditions,  I find that AG \u00b6 32(a) is applicable as \u201cso much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened\u201d that \u201cit is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 32(d) is also applicable, as \u201cthere is sufficient evidence of successful\nrehabilitation\u201d; \u201cbecause of the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s criminal activity has been mitigated. Paragraph 1, Guideline J is found for\nApplicant\n\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence does not establish that any\ndisqualifying conditions apply in this case. While Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana for three\nor four weeks in 2005 does show questionable judgement, he has averred that he has\nnot used it since that time, nor will he ever use it again. Also, while Applicant was in the\ncompany of a gang member in 2003, the evidence establishes that Applicant knew this\nindividual as a fellow employee, and Applicant never associated with him or anyone else\nin gang related activities. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, does not exhibit questionable\njudgement, unreliability, or a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, for\nApplicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the mitigating conditions apply, together with the positive, independent\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s character and good judgement, submitted in Exhibit A, I find that\nthe record evidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person concept. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.-1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.-2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. He failed to admit or deny the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2. I considered the two personal conduct allegations denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old ship fitter working for a defense contractor.3 He married his wife in 1986. He disclosed no children in his e-QIP. He did not serve in the military. He disclosed no felony convictions and no use of illegal drugs in the last seven years. He has worked for the same employer, a government contractor, since September 1972 to the present.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. Moreover, he deliberately omitted alcohol-related \nincidents from his security clearance application and made a false statement to a \ngovernment investigator. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 16, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 In September 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  Form Item 4. \n \nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn October 7, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Items 2 and 3). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated November 6, 2008, was \nprovided to him by letter dated November 10, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on November 18, 2008. He was afforded a period of 30 days to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He failed to \nsubmit any materials, comments, or objections in response to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on January 21, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. He failed to admit or deny the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6 2. I considered the two personal conduct allegations denied. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old ship fitter working for a defense contractor.3 He \nmarried his wife in 1986. He disclosed no children in his e-QIP. He did not serve in the \nmilitary. He disclosed no felony convictions and no use of illegal drugs in the last seven \nyears. He has worked for the same employer, a government contractor, since \nSeptember 1972 to the present. Applicant indicated he received access to classified \ninformation at the confidential level in May 1986 (Item 4, \u00a7 26). Apparently, his access \nhas never been suspended or revoked. \n \nHe was convicted four times for driving while impaired (DWI) (Items 5, 1 and 10). \nFebruary 1984, he has convicted of DWI and sentenced to 12 months jail (suspended), \nand placed on probation. In September 1989, he has convicted of DWI and sentenced \nto 18 months jail, most of the sentence was suspended, and he was placed on \nprobation. In September 1991, he has convicted of DWI and sentenced to two years jail \n(suspended), and placed on two years probation. In June 2004, he has convicted of \nDWI and sentenced to 18 months jail, most of the sentence was suspended. \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 4 (2006 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAs part of his sentence, Applicant was required to attend substance abuse \ncounseling from September 2004 to March 2005 (Item 8). He maintained abstinence \nthrough out his treatment period, successfully completed his counseling/treatment, and \nhis prognosis was considered good. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence. \nThe counselor recommended Applicant attend Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) as part of his \ntreatment/counseling plan. \n \nIn his answer to \u00a7 23(d) of his 2006 security clearance application (asking \nwhether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol \nor drugs), Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and disclosed he was convicted of DWI in June \n2004. He failed to disclose his 1984, 1989, and 1991 DWI charges and convictions. In \nresponse to \u00a7 25 (asking whether in the last 7 years his use of alcoholic beverages \nresulted in any alcohol related treatment or counseling), he answered \u201cYes,\u201d and \ndisclosed he received treatment from June to September 2004 (discrepant with Item 8). \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant provided a sworn statement to a government \nbackground investigator (Item 9). During the interview, Applicant discussed the \ncircumstances surrounding his 2004 DWI. Applicant told the agent that his 2004 arrest \nand DWI charge was the only time that he had ever been arrested and/or charged with \nany alcohol related offenses.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his alcohol related problems and \nincluded the review of his state\u2019s criminal records history (Item 5), his answers to four \nsets of DOHA interrogatories (Items 6, 7, 9, and 10), and his counselor\u2019s letter \nconcerning his 2005 alcohol-related treatment (Item 8).  \n \nIn his May 15, 2007, response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that he \nwas currently consuming alcoholic beverages weekly, and that he intended to continue \ndoing so in the future (Item 6). The last day he consumed alcoholic beverages was two \nday before he answered the interrogatories. He also stated he was not participating in \nAA. \n \nIn his March 31, 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated \u201cI [no] \nlonger abuse alcohol in that way anymore\u201d (Item 10). However, Applicant provided no \ninformation as to his present consumption of alcoholic beverages or abstinence, \nwhether he continued any alcohol counseling and/or treatment, and whether he has \ntaken any measures to avoid similar alcohol related problems in the future.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G the government\u2019s concern is that excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that in 1984, \n1989, 1991, and 2004 Applicant drove while impaired. He was convicted of DWI on four \noccasions and sentenced to jail (albeit suspended). Applicant excessive alcohol \nconsumption resulted in his exercising questionable judgment. Additionally, he was \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2005. Guideline G disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence . . ., and AG \u00b6 22(e): evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram, apply.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been involved in any alcohol-related \nmisconduct since June 2004. However, available evidence shows Applicant continued \nconsuming alcohol and he intends to continue to do so in the future. There is no \nevidence Applicant has continued his alcohol counseling/treatment, that he has \nacknowledged his alcohol dependence, or that he has made any lifestyle changes to \navoid future alcohol related problems. \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n  \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find none of the \nGuideline G mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence is not \nsufficient to fully raise the applicability of any of the mitigating conditions, or to show it is \nunlikely his questionable behavior will not recur. I specifically considered that \nApplicant\u2019s last DWI conviction was in 2004, and there is no evidence of additional \nalcohol-related misconduct. Notwithstanding, because he has three other DWI \nconvictions, I cannot find that his behavior was infrequent or that it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s recidivism shows he \nhas not learned from his past mistakes, and casts doubt on his good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nApplicant failed to disclose relevant information in his answers to \u00a7 23 (d) of his \nsecurity clearance application. He also falsified material facts in his statement to a \ngovernment investigator. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis \nto reach that conclusion, including: Applicant\u2019s maturity, his employment history, and his \nanswers to the four DOHA interrogatories.  \n \nBecause of his extensive work experience as a government contractor employee \nand holding a security clearance, Applicant knew or should have known the importance \nof accurately completing his security clearance application and telling the truth. \nNevertheless, he failed to provide information that was material to making an informed \nsecurity decision and made false statements. AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or to other official government representative.\u201d apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it does not \napply since his behavior is recent and shows Applicant\u2019s lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s 36 year record of employment for a government contractor weighs in \nhis favor. He has had access to classified information for 22 years. There is no evidence \nof any security violation, or that he is not a good, reliable and competent worker. These \nfactors show some responsibility and mitigation.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na history of alcohol abuse and was diagnosed alcohol dependent. Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification is directly related to his desire to hide his alcohol related problems. As such, \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress exists and it is likely it would \ncontinue to exist. Because of his years working for a government contractor and his \nmany years holding a security clearance, Applicant knew or should have known the \nimportance of the trust placed on him by the Government. Notwithstanding, he failed to \nbe candid and honest on his security clearance application and during his interview. His \nbehavior shows he lacks judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption and personal conduct.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a & 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated January 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d of the SOR. He completed his security clearance application on November 17, 2006. 1 Applicant, who is 51 years old, works as an instructor for a Department of Defense contractor, a position he started in June 2006. Applicant enlisted in the United States Navy in 1975 and received an honorable discharge in 1989 after more than 13 years of service. He held a top secret clearance while in the Navy without any violations. Since 1989, he has worked for Department of Defense contractors and has held a secret clearance without incident.2 Applicant married his first wife in 1977. She died in 1998 as a result of brain cancer. He has one son, now age 27, from this relationship. Applicant married his present wife in 2003.3 Physicians diagnosed Applicant\u2019s first wife with diabetes and schizophrenic paranoia. Her medical problems created financial problems throughout their marriage, particularly when his Navy duty assignments took him to sea. When he returned from sea duty, he found the utilities shut off and the bills unpaid. He would pay the bills upon his return. When his wife died, he incurred significant medical bills, after insurance payments. He paid these bills. 4 Around the time his wife died, his job required him to move from State A to State B, if he wanted to continue working. He owned a trailer in State A, which he tried to sell.

On December 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 23, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on January 22, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nMay 19, 2008\n\nResponse to SOR, dated January 22, 2008, at 1-2; GE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated\n1\nNovember 17, 2008) at 32.\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 7-10, 20-21; Tr. 20-21.\n2\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 11-14; Tr. 21.\n3\nTr. 22, 43.\n4\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 31, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 14, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on February 19, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2008. The government offered six\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted four exhibits (AE) A\nthrough D, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008. I held the record open until\nMay 14, 2008 for Applicant to submit additional matters.  On May 12, 2008, he\nsubmitted one additional document, which has been marked and received as AE E,\nwithout objection. The record closed on May 14, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d of the SOR.

Since 1989, he has worked for Department of Defense contractors and has\nheld a secret clearance without incident.2\nApplicant married his first wife in 1977. She died in 1998 as a result of brain\ncancer. He has one son, now age 27, from this relationship. Applicant married his\npresent wife in 2003.3\nPhysicians diagnosed Applicant\u2019s first wife with diabetes and schizophrenic\nparanoia. Her medical problems created financial problems throughout their marriage,\nparticularly when his Navy duty assignments took him to sea. When he returned from\nsea duty, he found the utilities shut off and the bills unpaid. He would pay the bills upon\nhis return. When his wife died, he incurred significant medical bills, after insurance\npayments. He paid these bills.  \n4\nAround the time his wife died, his job required him to move from State A to State\nB, if he wanted to continue working. He owned a trailer in State A, which he tried to sell.\n\nTr. 22-23.\n5\nTr. 24-25.\n6\nGE 3 (Interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s answers, dated July 6, 2007) at 3-5; Tr. 37, 39-40, 53-55.\n7\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s answers, dated June 5, 2007) at 2-3, 6, 10-14; AE A (Letter, dated April\n8\n28, 2008); Tr. 26.\n3\nHe found a prospective buyer, but she did not qualify for a mortgage. He made\narrangements for her to pay her monthly rent on the trailer directly to the mortgagor. If\nshe did so in a timely manner for a year, the mortgagor would qualify her for a\nmortgage. His renter got behind in the payments on several occasions, but would then\ncatch up on her payments. However, in 2001 after she again failed to make the monthly\npayments, the mortgagor initiated foreclosure procedures and notified Applicant of its\nactions. Applicant lacked the financial resources to pay the overdue mortgage payments\nand advised the mortgagor to proceed with foreclosure. He heard nothing further from\nthe mortgagor.  \n5\nThree years later, In 2004, a new creditor contacted Applicant about the unpaid\ndebt remaining from the foreclosure. He told the creditor that he could not pay the debt\nas he was losing his job. Applicant\u2019s employer laid him off in December 2004. During his\nperiod of unemployment, he paid his bills with his unemployment and money from his\n401k. When these funds were exhausted, he defaulted on his financial obligations. His\nwife did work part-time. In September 2005, he obtained a job paying $8 an hour. With\nhis low paying job and his wife\u2019s part-time job, they were able to meet minimal monthly\nliving expenses. After obtaining his current employment, he slowly began to repay\ndebts.6\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income totals $4,167 and his net monthly income totals\n$2,800. His current monthly expenses include $450 for an equity loan on his home,\n$465 for utilities, $250 for food, $180 for automobile expenses, $100 for clothing, and\n$200 for miscellaneous items totaling approximately $1,650. He owns two cars, without\nany debt. He has a company credit card, but no personal credit cards.  \n7\nFor the last year, Applicant has paid old debt, much of which is not listed in the\nSOR. He also pays $125 a month on the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. He began his\npayments on this debt in May 2007. His current balance is $1,729.8\nApplicant\u2019s largest debt in the SOR related to the unpaid balance on the trailer\nmortgage after the foreclosure sale. The current creditor, the third owner of the debt,\ncontacted him in March 2008 and offered to settle his debt for $10,000. To accept this\noffer, he contacted his current mortgagor and obtained an equity loan on his home. He\n\nGE 2, supra note 8, at 14; GE 6 (Credit report, dated October 18, 2007) at 2; AE B (Letter, dated April 21,\n9\n2008); AE D (Credit profile, dated April 2, 2008); AE E (Letter, dated May 9, 2008); Tr. 27-34, 42.\nTr. 43, 54-57.\n10\n4\npaid the settlement offer, which settled his debt in full. He also paid the two remaining\nsmall credit card debts of $259 and $417. Applicant has no other unpaid debts.   \n9\nApplicant acknowledges that he is a poor manager of money. Thus, his wife now\nhandles the family finances. He currently has no outstanding, unpaid debts. He can pay\nhis current monthly expense. He likes his current financial status and intends to remain\ndebt free.10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n5\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt after his first wife died and\nafter he lost his job. Although he paid his debts for a period of time, he ultimately\ndefaulted on his financial obligations. His unpaid debt existed for several years. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems were a constant problem during his first marriage, when he was on\nsea duty. After his first wife died, he incurred more debts related to her medical bills and\nhis job changes or loss. As continuous employment is not guaranteed, there is a\npossibility he will be unemployed in the future. This mitigating condition does not apply.\n\n6\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s more recent financial problems began 10 years ago when his first wife\nbecame seriously ill and eventually died, leaving him with unpaid medical bills. At the\nsame time, his job required him to move to another state. When he could not sell his\ntrailer, he rented to an individual who agreed to make the rental payments directly to his\nmortgagor. When she failed to meet the payments, he allowed the property to go to\nforeclosure as he was losing his job and did not have funds to pay the outstanding debt.\nI find this potentially mitigating condition applies in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not receive financial counseling. However, he\nhas resolved all of his delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement, except one.\nHe continues to make the monthly payment on the one remaining debt, under the\npayment plan he developed.  He is now financially sound and prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had financial problems for\nmany years during his first marriage. He managed his debts until after his first wife died\nand his job required him to move to another state. In 2004, he lost his job. He attempted\n\n7\nto continue paying his monthly expenses, including credit card debt. When he\nexhausted his monetary funds, he defaulted on his debts. Nine months after losing his\njob, he accepted a low paying job, the first job he could find. The income from this job\nenabled him to pay some household expenses, but did not provide him with any\nadditional resources to pay old debt. He obtained his current position in June 2006, and\nstarted to resolve some old debt. For the last year, he has worked with creditors to\nresolve his debts, and has successfully done so. Applicant has changed his attitude\ntowards the use of credit cards and his wife now manages the family finances because\nhe does not manage money well. Most significantly, he has taken affirmative action to\npay or resolve all his delinquent debts, including those debts which raise security\nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) As his debt is paid or under a payment plan, it cannot be\na source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all\nhis debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his\nfitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant had a difficult financial situation for 18\nmonths. When his income improved, he slowly worked on paying his debts. Besides the\none old debt he is paying monthly, he has only one debt, an equity loan on his house.\nHis lives within his financial means and does not live excessively. His old debts do not\nraise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1)-(9).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 4, 2009. The case was assigned to me on November 16, 2009. On \nDecember 29, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nJanuary 26, 2010. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered four \nexhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified \nand offered four documents which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 D. The \nrecord was held open until February 9, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. A six-page document was timely received and admitted as AE E. \nMarch 16, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the documents. Department Counsel\u2019s Response \nto AE E is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript (Tr) was received on \nFebruary 2, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old geospatial analyst for a Department of Defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his employer since August 2006. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance for the first time. He has an undergraduate degree in geography. He \nis single and has no children. He is in a long term relationship and intended to propose \nto his girlfriend the weekend after the hearing. (Tr at 22; Gov 1)  \n \nWhen Applicant was seven years old, he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit \nDisorder (ADD). He took various prescription drugs for his condition during his \nchildhood until college. In college, he was prescribed Adderall, a stimulant. His \npsychiatrist, whom he saw when he was home from college, provided him with \nprescription slips that were written in advance so that he did not have come home to fill \nhis prescription during the school year.

He \nscanned one of the prescription slips provided by his psychiatrist into a computer and \naltered the amount of the prescription. He did this approximately 16-20 times from the \nsummer 2005 to January 2006. By the fall 2005, he was taking four times the dosage \nprescribed to him. (Tr at 27-31, 53-55; Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at 2, 6; AE 4 at 19) \n \nOn January 19, 2006, he was arrested and charged with Obtaining Possession of \na Controlled Substance by Fraud. On that date, Applicant dropped off a forged  \nprescription at a pharmacy. The pharmacy contacted Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist to verify \nthe prescription. The psychiatrist told the pharmacist to call the police. When he \nappeared in court, Applicant was treated as a first offender and placed in a pre-trial \ndiversion program, the requirements of which included three years probation, a $300 \nfine, and treatment. He attended treatment until June 2006. During treatment, he \nlearned alternative ways to handle stress. (Tr at 30-34; Gov 2 at 3-4; Gov 3 at 6)  \n \nWhile on probation, Applicant took routine drug tests which he passed. Based on \nhis good conduct, he was released from probation one year early. His probation ended \nin February 2009. He has not used Adderall since the day before his arrest in January \n2006. (Tr at 35-36; AE 3 at 4) \n \nApplicant started using marijuana occasionally while in high school. He began to \nuse marijuana on a regular basis while in college. He used marijuana approximately 100 \ntimes while in college.  He stopped using marijuana in the spring 2003 because of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadded responsibilities related to his school activities, and it was expensive. He also \nwanted to stop using marijuana before he graduated from college and started his \nprofessional career. Applicant was aware that marijuana use was illegal when he used \nit. (Tr at 24-26, 46-49; Gov 2 at 17; Gov 3 at 2,5)  \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided a signed statement of intent stating that he \nhad no intent to abuse Adderall or any other drugs in the future.  He acknowledges that \nany clearance that he is granted could be automatically revoked if he abuses Adderall \nor any other drugs in the future. (AE E at 2) \n \nFrom October 4, 2005, to May 24, 2006, Applicant was treated by Dr. C, a \nlicensed psychologist, on issues related to his ADD, depression, and relationships.  In a \nletter, dated November 14, 2008, Dr. C indicates that Applicant worked diligently to \nenhance his coping skills with a combination of psychotherapy and appropriate \nmedication. He states Applicant acknowledged his abuse of stimulant medication and \nworked to overcome it with healthier alternative methods. He would not hesitate to hire \nApplicant. (Gov 4 at 27) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a letter on his behalf indicating that Applicant has \nworked for him since August 28, 2006. Applicant started out as an entry level \nGeospatial Analyst and has advanced to his current supervisory position of Lead \nGeospatial Analyst.  He states that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] competence, work ethic, dedication to \nquality, and attention to detail combined to allow him to move into his current position. \nHis professionalism and maturity have contributed to him becoming an effective leader \nwithin the production group and also allowed him to handle the added responsibility that \ncomes with the supervisory position. His dedication to his job and dedication to the \nUnited States of America cannot be questioned in any way.\u201d (AE A) Several of \nApplicant\u2019s friends and co-workers provided letters that say similar favorable things \nabout Applicant. (AE B \u2013 D) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential rather than actual risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) & 25(a) (any drug \nabuse); and DI DC \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) are \nrelevant to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant admits illegally using marijuana in high school \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand in college. He became dependent on Adderall in 2004. He forged prescriptions to \nfeed his habit from the spring 2005 until he was caught in January 2006.   \n \nOf the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC), two apply to Applicant\u2019s \ncase: \n \nDI MC \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies because \nApplicant has not abused drugs in over four years. His illegal marijuana use occurred in \nhigh school and college. He stopped using marijuana his senior year in college. His \nsupervisor and co-workers state that Applicant is a good employee. After college, he \nhas matured and worked his way up to a supervisory position. He has not taken \nAdderall since January 2006. There is no evidence of recent drug abuse. \n \nDI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n\u2026(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with \nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation) applies. Applicant has not abused \ndrugs in over four years. He intends never to abuse drugs again and signed a statement \nof intent acknowledging that any future drug abuse will result in the automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance.  \n \nDI MC \u00b6 26(c) (abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged \nillness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended) applies \nwith respect to Applicant\u2019s abuse of the prescription drug Adderall.  Applicant has been \nprescribed medication to treat his ADD for most of his childhood. He became dependent \non Adderall while in college. He quit taking Adderall after he was arrested in January \n2006. He has learned other ways to cope with his ADD and no longer takes prescription \nmedication.   \n \n \nThe drug involvement concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \nThe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is \nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use and his dependence on \nAdderall. His drug abuse occurred in high school and college. While his drug abuse \ncannot be considered experimental, Applicant has demonstrated that his drug abuse is \nno longer a concern. He has not used marijuana in over seven years and has not used \nAdderall since January 2006.  The favorable letters of his supervisor, friends, and co-\nworkers show that he has matured and has established a successful career as a \ngeospatial analyst. He is in a long term relationship which he anticipates will lead \ntowards marriage. He is aware that any future drug abuse will result in the automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance.  He has met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under the drug involvement concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",
