Rivera denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that he had not mitigated the security\nconcerns raised under Guidelines C and B.  In support of this argument, Applicant summarizes the\nfavorable evidence he presented below.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by his possession and renewal of a Polish passport, and his family\nties and property interests in Poland, had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees\nwith the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.   The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines C and B is\nsustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 50-year-old linguist, born in Iraq, granted asylum by the U.S., and naturalized\nas a U.S. citizen.  His mother and siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq, residing in an area\n\n2\ncontrolled by the Kurdistan Regional Government.  Applicant\u2019s identity is protected and his family\ncontacts are controlled and monitored.  The security concern based on foreign influence is mitigated.\nClearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 22, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 10, 2007, and heard on\nMarch 14, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 50-year-old linguist employed by a federal contractor supporting the U.S.\nArmy in Iraq (Tr. 6).  He was born in Iraq, graduated from college in Iraq in 1982 with a degree in\npublic health, and served as an enlisted soldier in the Iraqi Army from July 1983 to April 1984 (Tr.\n31; Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 27; GX 3 at 1).  In 1991, he began working for a non-\ngovernmental agency to rebuild villages in Kurdistan that had been destroyed by the Iraqi\ngovernment.  His agency received financial support from the U.S. (Tr. 32).  He was evacuated from\nby the U.S. Army when he was targeted by Iraqi intelligence because of his relationship with the U.S.\nHe, his brother, and his brother\u2019s family were evacuated across the border into Turkey in December\n1996, and then moved to Guam and granted asylum.  Applicant was in Guam for about three months\nand came to the U.S. in March 1997 (Government Exhibit 2 at 1).  The Kurdish authorities would\nnot permit Applicant\u2019s mother and other siblings to leave because they were not targeted by Iraqi\nintelligence (Tr. 34).\nApplicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in October 2005.  He has never held a final\nsecurity clearance, but he held an interim clearance from November 2005 until July 2006, when the\npreliminary decision underlying the SOR was made (Tr. 7; AX B at 1).  \nBefore Applicant was selected for duty as a linguist, he was interviewed and underwent\ncounterintelligence screening.  Only about 40 percent of linguist candidates successfully pass the\nscreening (AX B at 1).\nApplicant\u2019s military supervisor considered him hard-working and dedicated, often\nvolunteering for difficult and dangerous assignments that other linguists did not want (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit (AX) A).  He was especially valuable because he spoke the local dialect in the area where\nhe was assigned.  In Iraq, a word or phrase has different meanings depending on dialect and gestures\nof the speaker (AX B at 1).  In May 2006, Applicant received a certificate of appreciation from his\nunit (AX C).  His facility security officer rates his performance as excellent (AX B at 2).\n\nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the adjudicative facts regarding Iraq.\n1\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request, and the seven attachments substantiating the adjudicative facts to be noticed, are included\nin the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  \n4\nThe Army takes special precautions to protect Iraqi-born linguists and their families.\nApplicant works under a fictitious name.  He lives with the military unit he supports, and he is\nrestricted from traveling outside his duty area, which is a considerable distance from his family.  (AX\nB at 2).\nApplicant\u2019s 82-year-old mother, three brothers, and two sisters are citizens and residents of\nIraq (GX 2 at 2).  His mother and two sisters do not work outside the home, and they have no\ngovernment connections.  Two of his three brothers served as enlisted soldiers in the Iraqi Army.\nAll three brothers work for construction companies in Iraq.  \nApplicant had no contact with his family members in Iraq from 1997 to 2003 (Tr. 35).  He\nvisited his mother, one brother, and one sister in November 2006 (Tr. 36).  The visit was prompted\nby his mother\u2019s request that he visit her before she died (Tr. 36).  He has telephonic contact with his\nmother and older sister about once a month, contacts about once a year with a third brother and his\nyounger sister, and no contact with two of his brothers (Tr. 34-35; GX 2 at 2).  \nApplicant\u2019s family members live in northern Iraq, in an area controlled by the Kurdistan\nRegional Government, about 300 miles away from the more hostile areas of central Iraq and Bagdad.\nThis area and Applicant\u2019s family are very pro-American and supportive of U.S. efforts in Iraq\n(Answer to SOR; AX B at 2).\nApplicant told his mother he was working for the U.S. Army but did not tell her what he\ndoes.  His mother, an uneducated woman, told him to \u201cdo good job for America.\u201d  His other family\nmembers do not know he is working with the U.S. Army (Tr. 37).\nAfter a U.S.-led military coalition removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003, Iraq has\nevolved into a constitutional democracy with a federal system of government.  An elected\ngovernment took office in March 2006.  However, the Iraqi government has been unable to quell\nviolence by terrorists, insurgents, and sectarian militias.  U.S. contractors, humanitarian workers, and\nother non-combatants have been targeted, kidnaped, and murdered.  The Iraqi government has had\ndifficulty controlling its own security forces, leading to numerous human rights abuses.1\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\n\n5\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to\nclassified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nfor each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-\n1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3; see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under Guideline B is that a security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or\nobligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  \u201cThese situations could create\nthe potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when \u201c[a]n immediate family\nmember [spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign\ncountry.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1.  DC 1 is raised by the presence of Applicant\u2019s mother and\nsiblings in Iraq.\n\n6\nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under this guideline.  However, such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted\nto Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  \nIn cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of\na foreign country, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if the family members \u201care not agents\nof a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE2.A2.1.3.1.\nNotwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1(\u201cagents of a foreign power or in\na position to be exploited\u201d), it requires proof \u201cthat an applicant\u2019s family members, cohabitant, or\nassociates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, and (b) not in a position to be exploited\nby a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved\nand the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).  The totality of an\napplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.\nISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion.  The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nWhile the Iraqi government is not in complete control, it is allied closely with the U.S.  Only\nApplicant\u2019s mother knows he is associated with the U.S. Army, and even she does not know what\nhe does.  She is an elderly, uneducated widow, unlikely to call attention to herself.  She is pro-\n\n7\nAmerican and resides in a relatively secure, strongly pro-American region of Iraq.  Applicant\u2019s\nsiblings are unaware of his involvement with the U.S. Army.  Applicant\u2019s identity is protected, and\nhis freedom of movement and familial contacts are monitored and restricted.\nWhile Applicant is vulnerable to local violence to the same extent as the U.S. military\nmembers, the likelihood of his true identity being revealed and connected to his family in Iraq is\nextremely remote.  Absent such a connection, the likelihood of his family being exploited by anti-\nU.S. agents, terrorists, or extremists is remote.  I conclude MC 1 is established.\nA mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if \u201c[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.  There is a rebuttable presumption that\ncontacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-\n0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  MC 3 is established for Applicant\u2019s two brothers with whom he\nhas no contact, but it is not established for his mother and his other siblings in Iraq.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1\nthrough E2.2.1.9.  Some of these factors were incorporated in the discussion above, but some merit\nadditional comment.\nApplicant is a mature man who has experienced the threat of death for his political beliefs.\nHe literally owes his life to the U.S. Government.  He has voluntarily subjected himself to further\ndanger to support the U.S. forces.  During their last visit, his mother admonished him to do a good\njob for the Americans.  To yield to pressure or coercion would not only betray his affection for the\nU.S. and those who rescued him from death, it also would betray his mother\u2019s hopes.\nUnder the revised adjudicative guidelines implemented by the Department of Defense for\ncases where the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006 (Guidelines), a mitigating condition\nmay be established by showing \u201cthe individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 8(b).  While Applicant\u2019s case is not covered by the revised\nguidelines, the strength and depth of Applicant\u2019s devotion to the U.S. is a relevant consideration\nunder the whole-person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcern based on foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B (Foreign Influence):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 20, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\nSee, e.g., Item 9 at 2, Letter to Applicant terminating his employment.  The letter states that Applicant was\n1\nwarned twice, in writing, about his conduct.  Despite those warnings, \u201c[m]anagement recently had cause to believe that\nyou were again engaging in conduct that was in violation of [employer\u2019s] Internet and E-Mail Policies.

Applicant\nrequested decision on the written record.  On April 30, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 33-year-old employee\nof a defense contractor.  He served in the Navy from 1993 to 2002, holding a security clearance\nduring his service.  Applicant has four criminal offenses on his record, two of them DUIs.  The first\nDUI occurred in 1996 and the second in 1998.  In February 2003, Applicant was convicted of\nproviding alcohol to a minor, the result of his teenage stepchildren and their friends consuming\nalcohol at his house.  In 2004 he was convicted of misdemeanor assault for slapping his teenage\nstepdaughter.  From 2003 to 2005 Applicant was employed by a defense contractor.  The contractor\nterminated his employment, due to Applicant having violated company policy concerning internet\nand e-mail usage.  The company had given Applicant two prior written warnings that he risked losing\nhis job unless he changed his behavior.  Applicant\u2019s security clearance application inquired about\ndrug- or alcohol-related convictions.  Applicant listed his 1996 DUI but omitted the one in 1998.\nThe Judge stated, \u201cApplicant does not dispute that he deliberately failed to list his 1998 DUI.\nApplicant offered no mitigating evidence.\u201d  In the Analysis portion of his decision, the Judge stated\nthat \u201cApplicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns\nraised.  Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Decision at 3, 7.  \nApplicant contends that his prior employer warned him only once about his improper use of\ne-mail and the internet.  However, the record demonstrates that the Judge\u2019s finding of two warnings\nis supported by substantial evidence.   See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch\n1\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant deliberately\nomitted his 1998 DUI is also supported by substantial evidence.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the  decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\n\n3\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He \nfilled it out in connection with a previous employer and was terminated from that employer in July 2005. \nApplicant is sponsored for a security clearance by his current employer. \n \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct), M (Use of Information Technology Systems), and E \n(Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn November 26, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 7, 2009, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant did not submit any information within \nthe 30-day time period after receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to \nme on April 16, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old defense contractor employee. The FORM did not \ncontain any information regarding his education background. Applicant did serve in the \nU.S. Navy from August 1993 to September 2002, and was discharged as an E-4. He \nheld a secret security clearance while in the Navy. Applicant has been married since \nApril 2004. Although the FORM makes references to children and stepchildren, it does \nnot contain specific information about them.4  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation included a review of his SF-86,5 and \nvarious documents pertaining to his past arrests, and the underlying basis surrounding \nhis discharge from his previous employer.6 The Government established by Applicant\u2019s \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n3 DOHA transmittal letter is dated January 9, 2009; and Applicant received the FORM on January \n30, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to \nsubmit information.  \n4 Item 4. \n5 Item 3. \n6 Items 4 \u2013 11.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nadmissions and evidence presented that Applicant committed four criminal offenses, all \nof which he admits. Applicant has two arrests and convictions for Driving under the \nInfluence (DUI) of Alcohol in April 1996 and May 1998. In February 2003, he was \nconvicted of providing alcohol to a minor after two of his teenage stepchildren and their \nfriends consumed beer at his house. In September 2004, he was convicted of \nmisdemeanor assault for slapping his teenage stepdaughter in the face.  \n \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor from May 2003 to July 2005, \nand was involuntarily terminated for violating his employer\u2019s internet and e-mail policies, \nwhich he admitted. His employer undertook this action after having given him two \nwritten warnings in February 2004 and October 2004 informing him that he risked \ntermination unless he altered his course of conduct.  \n \nHis termination for violating his employer\u2019s internet and e-mail policies was cross-\nalleged under personal conduct. (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). Also, when Applicant completed his \nAugust 2003 SF-86, he failed to list the full extent of his alcohol/drug offenses. In \nparticular, he failed to list his February 2003 charge of contributing alcohol to minor and \nsubsequent conviction of providing alcohol to a minor. He also failed to list his May 1998 \narrest and charge of driving under the influence. A closer reading of Applicant\u2019s August \n2003 SF-86 reveals that Applicant did, in fact, disclose his 2003 offense elsewhere on \nhis SF-86. Applicant does not dispute that he deliberately failed to list his 1998 DUI. \n \nApplicant offered no mitigating evidence.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline J, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 30. \n \n7 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n8 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nUnder Guideline J, there are two Disqualifying Conditions raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconduct: AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d The Government established \nthese Disqualifying Conditions through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. \n \nThere are four Mitigating Conditions under Guideline J that potentially apply: AG \n\u00b6 32(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment;\u201d AG \u00b6 32(b) \n\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are \nno longer present in the person\u2019s life;\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c) \u201cevidence that the person did not \ncommit the offense;\u201d and AG \u00b6 32(d) \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, of \nconstructive community involvement.\u201d \n \nApplicant admitted each offense as alleged in the SOR under this concern, but \noffered no mitigating explanations. As such, I am unable to apply any of the potential \nMitigating Conditions under Guideline J. \n \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) \n \n \nUnder Guideline M, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, manipulation, storage, or protection of \ninformation. AG \u00b6 39. \n \n \nUnder Guideline M, there is one Disqualifying Condition raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconduct: AG \u00b6 40(e) \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem.\u201d The Government established this Disqualifying Condition through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented.  \n \n \nThere are three Mitigation Conditions under Guideline M that potentially apply: \nAG \u00b6 41(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment;\u201d AG \u00b6 41(b) \u201cthe misuse \nwas minor and done only in the interest of organizational efficiency and effectiveness, \nsuch as letting another person use one\u2019s password or computer when no other timely \nalternative was readily available;\u201d and AG \u00b6 41(c) \u201cthe conduct was unintentional or \ninadvertent and was followed by a prompt, good faith effort to correct the situation and \nby notification of a supervisor.\u201d  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s unauthorized internet and e-mail use was intentional, repeated, and \ncame after warnings from his supervisor to cease and desist, under threat of \ntermination. Applicant\u2019s employer considered his actions serious enough to warrant his \ntermination, so that his actions cannot be considered \u201cminor.\u201d Applicant has not shown \nthat the security concerns raised by his actions can be viewed as mitigated. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nUnder Guideline E, there are several Disqualifying Conditions raised by \nApplicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant\u2019s unauthorized internet and e-mail use at a previous \nemployer (discussed under Guideline M) is cross-alleged as a separate concern under \nPersonal Conduct because it constitutes questionable judgment and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations warranting application of AG \u00b6 16(d) \u201ccredible \nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not \nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . . \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d \n \n \nThe remaining Guideline E allegation concerns a falsification concern that \nwarrants application of AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that \nconclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education, his employment history, \nand his admission. \n \nThere are five Mitigating Conditions under Guideline E that potentially apply: AG \n\u00b6 17(a) \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\u201d AG \u00b6 17(b) \u201cthe \nrefusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly \ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide \nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully;\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d) \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur;\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted each offense as alleged in the SOR under this concern, but \noffered no mitigating explanations. His behavior raises questions about his ability and \nwillingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. His \nfalsification and lack of candor weigh against a finding of rehabilitation and positive \nbehavioral changes. As such, I am unable to apply any of the potential Mitigating \nConditions under Guideline E. \n \nAdditionally, for the same reasons outlined under the discussions of Guidelines J, \nM and E, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant=s behavior shows questionable \njudgment, lack of reliability, and untrustworthiness.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the \nwhole person concept was given due consideration, and that analysis does not support \na favorable decision. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On September 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines E and M. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 11, 2007, and requested a\ndecision based on the record without a hearing. On October 29, 2007, previously\nassigned Department Counsel requested a hearing. The government was prepared to\nproceed on December 7, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on December 20,\n2007. On January 17, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for February 28, 2008. \nApril 10,2008\n\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and\ntwo Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were admitted without any objections and Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 10, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s\nrequest, the record was held open until March 13, 2008, for him to submit work\nperformance evaluations and awards. On March 11, 2008, Applicant timely forwarded\nfive documents. The government did not object to their admission, and they were\nreceived as Exhibits C through G. For the reasons discussed below, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant misused a\ngovernment computer and system in April 2005 by posting sexually explicit material\nonto a server at work from a personal portable drive (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he misused the\ngovernment computer by maintaining sexually explicit material on his government-\nowned work computer in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that during an investigation into the\nposting of inappropriate adult material on the server he initially denied any involvement\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) and that he had saved the adult material on his work computer (SOR \u00b6\n1.d); and that he was terminated from his job because of his violations of company\npolicies on the use of government equipment and his attempts to conceal facts during\nthe company\u2019s investigation (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The misuse of the government computer\nsystem by posting sexually explicit material on the server and by maintaining sexually\nexplicit materials on his work station were also alleged under Guideline M, use of\ninformation technology systems (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant provided a detailed answer indicating that he had inadvertently posted\nthe sexually explicit material on his work computer. Working long hours at home,\nApplicant indicated he had transported non-sensitive files using his personal memory\ndisks and that he unintentionally grabbed the folder containing sexually explicit material\nalong with his work folder and copied both onto the portable media. While loading the\nwork files onto the system, he also grabbed the folder with the sexually explicit material.\nAs for maintaining sexually explicit material on his work computer, Applicant explained\nthat the loading of files was accidental. Applicant admitted that during the company\u2019s\ninvestigation, he had initially denied he had loaded any adult material on the server,\nalthough after seeing the files he knew they were his but \u201cstill had no idea how they got\nthere.\u201d Applicant admitted that inappropriate files had apparently been on his hard drive\nsince he used his computer as an intermediary in moving from the media to the server,\nbut he denied any awareness prior to the investigation. Applicant acknowledged his\nemployment termination for a mistake that cost him and his family dearly. He indicated\nhe was now \u201coverly conservative\u201d and never commingles files nor uses portable media.\nAfter consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old senior systems engineer who has worked for his\ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since October 2005 (Ex. 1). He seeks a secret-\nlevel clearance for his duties in systems architecture and design, involving a military\ndestroyer program (Tr. 19, 38, 43-44). \n\n3\nIn May 1980, Applicant was awarded his bachelor of science degree in general\nengineering from a U.S. military academy (Ex. 1, Tr. 41-42). The following month, he\nmarried his first wife (Ex. 1). He served on active duty with a secret-level security\nclearance until May 1985 when he was discharged at the rank of captain (Ex. 1, Tr. 42).\nIn about 1992, Applicant went to work at a national laboratory for a company\nhired to oversee the contractors maintaining and operating the site for the U.S.\ngovernment. Applicant stayed on at the facility under the employ of a succession of\ncontractors that maintained the facility over the years.  (Ex. 1, Tr. 44-45).\nIn June 1997, Applicant and his first wife divorced (Ex. 1). She had left him with\ntheir three children to raise on his own. His son was born in August 1988 and his two\ndaughters were born in September 1990 and November 1993 (Ex. 1, Tr. 32, 42-43). In\nAugust 1997, Applicant married his second wife, but they divorced in September 2002.\nIn July 2004, Applicant wed his current spouse, and his household expanded to include\nher four biological children. In December 2004, Applicant legally adopted her youngest,\na boy born in November 1998 (Ex. 1, Tr. 43).\nApplicant was happy in his new marriage, which included some sexual\nexperimentation, taking pictures of themselves performing sexual acts, watching X-rated\nmovies, and viewing sexually explicit material on their computer together (Tr. 32, 61, 71-\n72). So that his children were not exposed to this pornographic material, Applicant kept\nthe sexually explicit images on personal portable media (a computer jazz drive) (Tr. 28-\n30, 51, 71). He testified most of the files were given a generic identifier, \u201clike AA, A1\"\n(Tr. 54). Applicant promised his spouse that he would not view any pornographic\nmaterial by himself, but he intermittently viewed sexual images from his jazz drive on his\ndesktop at work (Tr. 58-59). Applicant denies ever viewing pornographic websites at\nwork (Tr. 58). He was unaware at that time that files accessed by the computer were\ncached (Tr. 28), but he knew it was against company policy to view pornographic\nmaterial on his work computer (Tr. 60).\nThe information resources used by employees of the cleanup project were\ngovernment property. Information resources included all government-owned or\ngovernment-funded data communication equipment and services, located on or off site,\nincluding but not limited to personal computers, laptop computers, workstations,\nnetworking services, mainframes, associated peripherals and software, and government\nprovided access to electronic mail, the intranet, and the Internet. Under section 1 of the\nemployee handbook applicable to those on the cleanup project, government or\ncompany equipment was to be used for official business only. Employees were\nspecifically advised in the handbook that the use of government equipment or services\nto intentionally access, download, or otherwise transmit any sexually explicit material\nwould not be tolerated and would result in discipline up to and including discharge (Ex.\n2).\nAs of April 2005, Applicant was involved in the clean up project at the laboratory\nwhere he oversaw and supported the lead on the chemical management system. With a\n\nApplicant testified that the material went straight from the portable drive onto the server and that nothing from\n1\nthe portable drive should have remained on his desktop\u2019s hard drive (Tr. 52). \nThe inappropriate material did not include any child pornography (Ex. 2).\n2\nThis statement was not included in the evidentiary record available for review.\n3\n4\nnew contractor taking over in May 2005, Applicant had been looking at various\ncommercial systems to manage and report the laboratory\u2019s hazardous and radiological\nwaste, as the home-grown system had become very expensive to maintain (Tr. 47).\nApplicant put in long hours at work and home evaluating a commercial software system\nand the laboratory\u2019s requirements (Tr. 70). Applicant transported the information to work\non at home via his personal jazz drive that also contained sexually explicit images. He\nkept the information segregated in different folders (Tr. 50).\nOn April 20, 2005, Applicant inadvertently posted a folder containing about 50\nimages and videos of a sexually explicit nature, including images (\u201cfour or five, or a\ndozen\u201d) of him and his spouse performing sex acts, onto the server at work (Tr. 60-61).\nWhile uploading onto the server the data he had worked on at home the night before,\nApplicant grabbed from his jazz drive not only the folder containing the work data, but\nalso a folder on which he had stored sexual images and videos (\u201cif you touch another\nfolder that you didn\u2019t mean to, and if you don\u2019t notice that you did and you just grab and\ndrag and drop it. . . .\u201d) (Ex. 2, Tr. 30-31, 50-51).  On April 26, 2006, another employee\n1\non the cleanup project found the inappropriate adult material on the laboratory\u2019s server,2\nand reported it. During an investigation, Applicant was linked with ownership of the\nfolder through his user id and records showing that his office computer was logged onto\nthe server when the folder was uploaded. Firewall logs for Applicant\u2019s work computer for\n2005 to date did not show any access to obvious adult sites (Ex. 2).\nApplicant was interviewed by the investigator on April 28, 2005. He was told up-\nfront that the investigation concerned the posting of inappropriate adult material to a lab\nserver and that if he was involved in that activity, he should tell him so. Applicant denied\nany involvement or any knowledge of it. After he was shown the titles of the material\nposted to the server, Applicant acknowledged that it was material from his home\npersonal computer (\u201cHe showed them to me and I said I couldn\u2019t have done that, I keep\nthem you know, I keep them all separate, and maybe, I had never saved them on my\nhard drive at work or anything else, so I was just in total shock. . . .\u201d Tr. 53). Applicant\nsurmised he brought it in by mistake with material he had taken home to work on, and\ndenied he had purposely posted the files to the server. The investigator expressed his\nbelief that Applicant had meant to save the sexual material on his work computer.\nApplicant responded that he would not save it to his personal computer as he did not\nview that type of material at work (\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more disbelief or I can\u2019t really tell\nyou the emotional state at that point, but, no, I was not forthright at the interview. . . .\u201d\nTr. 73). After Applicant provided a written statement,  the investigator checked\n3\nApplicant\u2019s work computer in his presence. The investigator found 129 adult images in a\ntemporary folder that had been created on April 20, 2005, about 15 minutes before the\n\n5\nsexually explicit images appeared on the server. Twenty-eight MPEG files were found in\na recent folder. The investigator determined the MPEG files had been viewed on the\ncomputer using Windows Media Player but were not presently on the computer. The\ntitles of the files in the two folders on Applicant\u2019s work computer were then compared to\nthe titles in the folder loaded on the server. Only two of the 129 JPEG files matched the\nnames of JPEG images on the server, but one was not the same image and the other\ncouldn\u2019t be viewed. There were some title matches in the other folder. Applicant was\ninvoluntarily terminated from his employment on May 9, 2005, for misuse of a\ngovernment computer and system and attempt to conceal facts during the company\u2019s\ninvestigation, in violation of company policies (Ex. 2, Tr. 61).\nApplicant was unemployed for a few months as he was unable to find another job\nin a close-knit town in which there were few opportunities outside of farming or the\nservices industry that supported the national laboratory site. In October 2005, he began\nworking for his present employer. Applicant regrets that he had to move his children\nacross the country away from the only home and the friends they had known (Tr. 33,\n63).\nOn November 21, 2005, Applicant completed an e-QIP in application for a secret-\nlevel security clearance. Applicant disclosed his termination from his previous\nemployment in May 2005, for copying what he thought were work-related files onto the\nserver but \u201c[o]n that disk was some files of a personnal [sic] nature, including files that\nwere pornographic.\u201d He explained that he did not realize what he had done until he was\ninterviewed by an investigator, and that during the interview he was not as open as he\nshould have been, mainly because of the embarrassment to him and his spouse.\nApplicant that he and his spouse no longer take any pictures of themselves, and regrets\nnot being as forthright as he should have been (Ex. 1).\nAll but the youngest of Applicant\u2019s children are aware of the reason for his firing,\nalthough they don\u2019t know all the details (Tr. 34). Applicant has not told his present\nemployer that he had been terminated from his previous job, although he maintains he\nwould divulge it if he had to (Tr. 64). During the hiring process, he told his employer he\nneeded a new job (\u201cif you are seeking employment, you don\u2019t say, of, and by the way,\nyou know, so no, unless you don\u2019t want the job\u201d) (Tr. 65).\nApplicant no longer uses any portable media. His computer is located in a public\narea of the house (Tr. 34, 65). He also made an effort to educate himself about\nbusiness ethics and computer systems in general (Tr. 34, 68). He has read his current\nemployer\u2019s policies concerning information security, including business ethics,\nacceptable uses of the Internet, authorized limited personal use of company assets,\ncorporate security, and control of company sensitive information (Ex. A). He also\ncompleted training offered by his employer, including introductory business ethics on\nDecember 15, 2005, code of conduct on September 28, 2006, ethical awareness and\ndecision making on March 29, 2007, and information security awareness on May 31,\n2007 (Ex. B).\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s work performance over the past two years has been recognized by\nhis employer (Ex. C, Ex. D, Ex. E, Ex. F, Ex. G). Once in 2006 and twice in 2007, he\nwas given individual performer achievement awards for outstanding efforts on the\nproposals involving the military destroyer program (Ex. C, Ex. D, Ex. G). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\nApplicant indicated on his e-QIP that his supervisor was well aware that he was taking work home (Ex. 1),\n4\nbut this does not mean that his supervisor knew he was using a portable jazz drive that also contained\npornographic images.\n7\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant exercised extremely poor judgment by viewing pornographic images on\na government-owned computer at work intermittently in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Unaware that\nthe images were cached in the computer\u2019s memory, Applicant yet knew it was a misuse\nof a government information resource and against company policy to view sexually\nexplicit images on his work computer.\nIn April 2005, he also uploaded sexually explicit images from his personal jazz\ndrive onto a server at work (SOR \u00b6 1.a). This was also a misuse of a government\ninformation system. It is not clear whether he was authorized to process work using his\npersonal jazz drive.  Under section 1 of the employee handbook, bringing or using\n4\nunauthorized personal computer hardware and/or software to work could subject an\nemployee to suspension (see Ex. 2), but his use of a jazz drive containing sexually\ninappropriate material in a government system was clearly against company policy.\nDuring the government investigation, 129 adult images were found in a temporary file\non Applicant\u2019s workstation computer. However, Applicant credibly testified he did not\nknowingly post the sexual images onto the server:\nHe had asked did you put pornographic files on the server and I was like\nno, I didn\u2019t. I mean something like that, intentionally doing, you know, no, I\njust, no, I would never do that, that would be, you know, first of all, that\nwould be stupid because I would know that, pardon the expression, it\nwouldn\u2019t be very smart because I know other people have access, that\u2019s\nour server that our team uses every single day to push information back\n\n8\nand forth, so it would be immediately visible to anybody and everyone\nwithin that group (Tr. 73).\nSome of the sexually explicit images were of Applicant and his spouse, and he is\nunlikely to have knowingly transferred images that could possibly be recognized by a\ncoworker. Since he did not realize that he had loaded the inappropriate adult images on\nthe server until he was shown the titles of the material posted to the server, I find\nApplicant also did not intentionally fail to disclose to the investigator that the material\nwas from his personal portable drive and that he had posted it onto the server. Yet,\nApplicant lied when he then indicated to the investigator that he had not viewed\npornography on his work computer. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative\u201d) applies because of that falsification.\nApplicant\u2019s use of his work computer to view pornography led to inappropriate\nadult images being maintained on the computer. His repeated rule violations involved\nsignificant misuse of government resources. Although this conduct raises judgment\nconcerns of the type contemplated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) (\u201ca pattern of dishonesty or\nrule violations\u201d) and 16(d)(4) (\u201cevidence of significant misuse of Government or other\u2019\nemployer\u2019s time or resources\u201d), \u00b6 16(d) does not apply since the misuse of a\ngovernment information system is explicitly covered under \u00b6 39, infra.\nPersonal conduct concerns may also be raised where there is evidence of\n\u201cconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(e)).\nApplicant maintains, with no evidence to the contrary, that his spouse and all but the\nyoungest of his children are aware to some degree of the circumstances leading to his\ntermination from his previous employer. However, he has not volunteered to his current\nemployer that he was fired from his previous position. While it is understandable that he\nwould not want to divulge the basis for his employment termination, it raises a risk of\nvulnerability, so AG \u00b6 16(e) applies.\nHis failure to be up-front about his knowing misuse of the government-owned\ninformation system is not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a), which requires that the effort at\nrectification be prompt, in good faith, and before confrontation (\u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts\u201d).  The company investigator learned that Applicant had\nviewed inappropriate adult images on his work computer by use of an investigative\nsearch tool on the computer itself and not from Applicant. More than two years have\npassed since Applicant\u2019s misuse of his work computer was discovered, but his knowing\ndisregard of his company\u2019s policies prohibiting unauthorized use of a government-\nowned asset, and his breach of his obligation to his employer to cooperate with the\ninvestigation, cannot reasonably be characterized as minor offenses mitigated under \u00b6\n17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\n\n9\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d). \nApplicant has acknowledged that he made bad judgments (\u201cI was maybe in\nmiddle age crisis or whatever, but it happened\u201d), including that he violated the trust of\nhis spouse by viewing the sexual images at work (Tr. 32-33). Applicant made changes\nto prevent recurrence of his misuse of a computer by putting his personal computer in\nthe open and educating himself about his ethical responsibilities to his current employer.\nConcerning his falsification, he disclosed on his e-QIP that he had been fired in May\n2005 for inadvertently copying files of a personal nature, \u201cincluding files that were\nconsidered pornographic,\u201d onto the server at work, and that he had not been as open as\nhe should have been during the investigation. He expressed regret at not being as\nforthright as he should have been. However, AG \u00b6 17(d) (\u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur\u201d) applies only in part. \nAs persuasively argued by the government, Applicant has not adequately\nexplained what led him to view sexual images at work in the first place. He has not\nobtained any counseling, so it is not clear whether the factors that led to the behavior\nare not going to recur. More troubling is Applicant\u2019s characterization of his conduct as \u201ca\nsingle issue\u201d and as \u201ca one time mistake.\u201d (See Answer). While the loading of the\nimproper adult material on the server occurred one time and was unintentional, he\nviewed sexual images on his work computer intermittently. In response to SOR \u00b6 1.b,\nApplicant indicated, \u201cI never intentionally misused the computer and loading the files\nwas an accident.\u201d Applicant did not realize that previously viewed images remained\nautomatically cached on his workstation computer, but it is not accurate for him to\nmaintain that he never intentionally misused the computer since he knew he had viewed\nsexual images off his jazz drive at work on the government-owned computer monitor.\nThe ethics courses Applicant took at work have yet to impress upon him the obligation\nof full candor.\nFurthermore, AG \u00b6 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or\neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d) applies only in part.\nAlthough Applicant claims he would divulge the circumstances surrounding his\ntermination if he had to, and his spouse would support him in that regard, his employer\nis still unaware that he left his previous job under unfavorable circumstances. It is not\nclear whether the security office at work viewed his completed e-QIP before or after he\nsubmitted it, which would have gone a long way towards eliminating the vulnerability\nconcerns raised by his concealment of his job firing from his present employer.\n\nApplicant was asked how many times he had brought the jazz drive containing sexually explicit images to\n5\nwork and he testified, \u201cA lot\u201d (Tr. 71), all after his marriage to his current wife.\n10\nGuideline M\u2014Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe security concern related to the guideline for use of information technology\nsystems is set out in \u00b6 39:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nAs discussed under Guideline E, supra, Applicant violated his employer\u2019s polices\nconcerning authorized use of a government-owned information resource asset when he\nimproperly and repeatedly viewed adult images using his work computer in 2005 if not\nbefore,  and on that occasion in April 2005 when he inadvertently, but negligently\n5\nloaded sexually explicit images onto a national laboratory\u2019s server. AG \u00b6 40(e)\n(\u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system\u201d) and \u00b6\n40(f) (\u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to\nor from any information technology system without authorization, when prohibited by\nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations\u201d) apply.\nThere is no evidence of any misuse of a work computer by Applicant since he\nstarted with his present employer in October 2005. Yet, Applicant has not shown that\n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under unusual\ncircumstances, such that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 41(a)). His knowing\ndisregard of policies prohibiting unauthorized use continues to cast doubt about his\npersonal judgment, notwithstanding the passage of almost three years since his\nconduct was discovered in April 2005. He made no showing that his viewing of sexually\nexplicit images was unusual, even at work.\nIn the absence of any evidence that Applicant\u2019s posting of sexually explicit\nimages on the server was other than an isolated mistake, mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n41(c) (\u201cthe conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt,\ngood-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor\u201d) applies, but\nonly in part. Once he was informed of the titles of the sexually explicit material on the\nserver, Applicant acknowledged it was his and that he must have loaded it by mistake.\nNot all of the JPEG/MPEG files on his computer matched those loaded onto the server,\nand his viewing/maintaining sexually explicit material on the computer is not mitigated\nunder AG \u00b6 41(c). As discussed supra, the steps Applicant has taken to preclude a\n\nApplicant\u2019s employment termination does not represent additional misconduct, but is merely the\n6\nconsequences of his knowing violation of company policies and his effort to cover it up.\n11\nrecurrence do not completely mitigate this knowing and repeated disregard of company\npolicy concerning the use of a government-owned information resource.\nI have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole person concept, applying\nthe conclusions set forth previously in this analysis. Applicant\u2019s work performance for\nhis current employer has been outstanding. Yet, while he claims he learned a \u201chard\nlesson\u201d and paid a high price for his mistakes, including his failure to be \u201cfully straight\nout\u201d with the government investigator (Tr. 39-40), I am unable to conclude under the\ntotality of the facts and circumstances that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him a security clearance. He has not been fully forthcoming with his\nemployer about his firing from his previous job, or with the Department of Defense about\nthe extent of his misuse of the work computer when he answered the SOR. Even at his\nhearing, he was reluctant to take responsibility for misuse of the computer to view the\npornography on his personal portable drive. A \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d does not adequately\nexplain what led him to violate his employer\u2019s policies concerning the use of the work\ncomputer.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant6\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRoyce Russell, Esq. \nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 27-year-old engineer with a major defense contractor, failed to mitigate personal\nconduct security concerns under Guideline E for failure to report at Question 24 an arrest for\nmarijuana possession in connection with an arrest for gun possession which he did report at Question\n23 on his SF 86. He also failed to report occasional marijuana use over a two year period both on his\nSF 86 at Question 27, and in an interview with an investigator. He only acknowledged the use in\nresponse to an interrogatory one year later. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 16, 2007, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received February 8, 2007, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March\n28, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued June 7, 2007 for a hearing held on June 26, 2007. The\nGovernment introduced five exhibits and Applicant introduced seven. All were accepted into\nevidence. Applicant testified on his behalf and an investigator testified for the government. The\ntranscript was received on July 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the specific facts in the SOR allegations relating to personal\nconduct security concerns. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as an engineer\nsince February, 2005. He graduated from college with a B.S. in electrical engineering and is working\non an M.B.A degree. The events that gave rise to this matter occurred the day before his graduation\non June 12, 2004, when he and three friends traveled from their home over 100 miles to New York\nCity for an evening to celebrate his graduation. They traveled in a SUV rented by Applicant but\ndriven by one of the others. When they crossed into New York City they were stopped by the police\nand advised that they were driving recklessly although no such charge was filed. The officers\nsearched the car and found three guns owned by Applicant and two of the others. They all had\nlicenses to carry the guns in the home city but not in New York City. \nAlso, a small amount of marijuana valued at less than $10 was found in the vehicle or on the\nperson of another passenger. All four people in the vehicle spent the night in jail and were charged\n\n3\nwith illegal gun possession and possession of marijuana (Exh. 2). The marijuana was in the actual\npossession of one of the other three persons in the car but Applicant was also charged with\npossession. As a result of these events, Applicant missed his graduation and caused considerable\nembarrassment to his family and friends. After protracted delays and motions in court over the period\nof a year, Applicant pled guilty to third degree gun possession, a third degree felony. On May 11,\n2005, he was fined $800 and ordered to perform 25 hours of community service. He completed the\nservice with the Boy Scouts. He was also advised that if he had no further legal difficulties for three\nyears, the conviction would be expunged. The judge gave him a sentence of much less than the\nprosecutor requested and indicates a compassionate approach to his conduct (Attachment to Exh. 4).\nThe charges and conviction in New York are not alleged in the SOR but only conduct relating to his\nsecurity clearance process. \nFollowing college graduation, Applicant was hired by his employer and submitted his\napplication for a security clearance (SF 86) on February 10, 2005 (Exh. 1). In response to Question\n23 concerning his police record-pending charges, he answered \u201cYes\u201d and identified the pending\nmatter with the date of the New York events and the nature of the charge as \u201cgun possession.\u201d The\ngovernment alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.a. that he failed to honestly report the marijuana charge in his\nresponse to Question 24 Your Police Record-Alcohol /Drug Offenses and Question relating to being\ncharged or convicted of any offense relating to alcohol or drugs. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to that question.\nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator under contract with the government on\nSeptember 7, 2005, on a variety of subjects but primarily about the events of June 12, 2004,\nespecially the gun possession charges as well as the marijuana charge which he described in great\ndetail. He stated to the investigator that he had never smoked marijuana and never participated in\nillegal drug use. Subsequently, interrogatories were submitted by the government to Applicant and\nhe responded on October 10, 2006, (Exh. 4) with details of the disposition of the New York charges.\nHe also stated at Question 6 relating the marijuana possession charge that he had experimented with\nmarijuana no more than ten times from 2000 to 2004. This information  was at variance with his\nstatement to the investigator a year earlier. This inconsistency resulted in the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nthat he falsified information on his SF 86 at Question 27 by failing to state his earlier marijuana use.\nA second set of interrogatories was sent to Applicant and he responded on November 9,\n2006, (Exh. 5) in which he responded to questions concerning his inconsistent statements regarding\nmarijuana use. In it he stated again that he had experimented with marijuana in college but not a\nregular or consistent drug user. He described it as a youthful indiscretion and that he had reflected\non his earlier answers given to the investigator and wanted to ensure that he was being completely\nhonest so had corrected the information given to the investigator in the answers to his first\ninterrogatory. These circumstances led to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. that he had deliberately\nfalsified material facts when he stated to the investigator in September 2005, that he had never used\nmarijuana.\nApplicant did not believe that the marijuana possession charge was sufficiently important to\nreport on the SF 86 since the drug was not his but was owned by a fellow passenger. He also felt\nthat the drug use was only experimental and random over the four year period so unnecessary to\nreport it on the SF 86 or to the investigator. However, on reconsideration he desired to make a full\ndisclosure of the drug use and thus gave a full answer in his first interrogatory one year after his\nstatement to the investigator. \n\n4\nApplicant is single and on an excellent career path with his company. The New York charges\nwere his only instance of criminal conduct. He was hired under a minority engineering program that\nhis company sponsors and he is highly regarded by his supervisors (Exhs. A-D). He volunteers as\nmentor and works with high school students to interest them in engineering. He has worked with\nscience fairs and has been commended for his efforts.\nApplicant held an interim security clearance with his company until this matter arose and\nnow he works on unclassified projects. This limits his ability to function to the highest level and\nimpedes promotion prospects although he has received four increases in salary since he began his\nemployment. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe Government established each of the allegations under Guideline E Personal Conduct\nalleged in the SOR. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) are applicable to cases with an SOR\ndated after September 1, 2006. The specific condition applicable to this case is AG \u00b6 16 (a) involving\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his drug arrest at Question 24 and his drug use at Question 27 on his SF\n\n5\n86. Applicant\u2019s statement to the investigator in 2005 that he had never used marijuana followed by\nthe admission one year later that he had used it over a four year period, also prompted the allegations\nof security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) These omissions and false statements\nraise issues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information (AG \u00b6 15). Specifically, the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application (AG\n\u00b6 16 a), or to an investigator (AG \u00b6 16 b) could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. \nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable include under AG \u00b6 17(a) that the\nindividual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts, and under AG \u00b6 17(c) if the fact that the offense is so minor,\nor so much time has passed, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nWhile I am sympathetic to Applicant\u2019s belief that the gun possession charge was the more\nsignificant of the New York charges which he reported at Question 23. However, he should have\nreported the marijuana possession charge at Question 24 since he knew about it at least two weeks\nafter the arrest (Tr. 69). I cannot accept his statement that he regarded four years of occasional drug\nexperimentation as unworthy of being reported at Question 27 when the question clearly asks for\nsuch information. Had he answered it fully and frankly, it is likely there would have been no serious\nsecurity concern because of his age at the time of use, the frequency of use, and the passage of time\nsince the use. But he did not and I conclude that he should have reported it and the omission was not\ninadvertent. I reach the same conclusion as the denial of use to the investigator that he corrected only\none year later when he was asked to submit the first interrogatory. Thus MC 17 (a) is inapplicable\nsince the correction was not prompt and submitted only in response to a government interrogatory.\nWhile I am also sympathetic to Applicant\u2019s lack of any criminal behavior before the New\nYork arrest, I cannot regard the offense as minor, or that enough time has passed since the\ninvestigative interview to justify application of MC 17 (c) to the denial of drug use in that interview.\nWhile the circumstances surrounding the events in New York in 2004 leading to the omissions and\nmisstatements to the investigator, were unique in that it involved a graduation, a trip of over 100\nmiles to go to a club, and carrying three guns in a rented vehicle, the seriousness of the charges\noutweigh application of the mitigating factor as to the subsequent omissions regarding the arrest. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nIn evaluating his behavior in terms of the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d(AG \u00b6 2), an applicant may\nmitigate security concerns by demonstrating the factors leading to the violation are not likely to\nrecur(\u00b6 9), the nature and extent of the conduct (\u00b6 1), and there is evidence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes (\u00b6 6). The incidents that gave rise to this proceeding may not be likely\n\n6\nto recur. However, the SOR allegations all relate to the security clearance process which, if his career\ncontinues, will recur. There certainly is evidence of remorse for the arrest and his failure to fully\nreport the incident as indicated in his written statements in the record and his testimony. His\nknowledge of the security process should improve as a result of this proceeding. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude it is premature to grant a security clearance to him at this time.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nScott A. Ashelman, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 11, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 29, 2006, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant submitted a timely appeal pursuant to\n\n2\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision under Guideline H is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; whether the Judge\nerred in his interpretation and application of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7986(c)(2).\n(1) Applicant\u2019s counsel contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised under Guideline H had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, he argues that the\nJudge overstated the seriousness of the Applicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct\u2014the illegal use of\nmarijuana and cocaine over a 17 year period\u2014and gave insufficient weight to the fact that Applicant\nhad acknowledged his drug problem, had been drug free for almost a year, had promised to abstain\nfrom using illegal drugs in the future, and was hard-working and responsible.  Applicant\u2019s arguments\ndo not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn his decision, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation under Guideline H was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that\nwas before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline H is not\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(2) Applicant\u2019s counsel also contends that the Judge erred in his interpretation and\napplication of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7986(c)(2), and therefore in his adverse finding with respect to SOR\nparagraph 1.d.  In support of that contention, he argues that there is no record evidence that\nApplicant has used illegal drugs since January of 2006, so there is no evidence that Applicant is\ncurrently an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance, within the meaning of that\nstatute.  Although Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard may have merit (See ISCR Case No. 03-25009\nat 3-5 (App. Bd. June 28, 2005)), the Board need not resolve the issue because, as noted above, the\nJudge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is otherwise sustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 13, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense (DoD)\nDirective 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) on July 31, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (RAG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the RAG are to be used in all cases\nwhen the SOR is issued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued prior to\nSeptember 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case proceed under the old guidelines.  Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on August 9, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2007.  The Notice of Hearing was\nissued on January 31, 2007.  I convened a hearing on February 6, 2007, to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nThe government offered eleven exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-11.  Applicant offered no exhibits.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 14, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel asked me to take administrative notice of the contents\nof the following U.S. Department of State documents: Iran Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Report,\ndated October 2006 (Exhibit 3); Iran Bureau of Consular Affairs Report, dated October 11, 2006\n(Exhibit 4); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2005: Iran, Bureau of Democracy, Human\nRights, and Labor Report, dated October 12, 2006 (Exhibit 5); Country Reports on Terrorism,\nChapter 6, \u201cState Sponsors of Terror, Overview,\u201d Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism,\ndated April 28, 2006 (Exhibit 6); Testimony of Director, Central Intelligence, before the Senate\nSelect Committee on Intelligence (Global Intelligence Challenges 2005, dated February 16, 2005\n(Exhibit 7); \u201cIran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses, Congressional Research Service Report,\ndated June 2, 2006 (Exhibit 8); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2005: Turkey, Bureau\nof Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Report, dated March 8, 2006 (Exhibit 9); Turkey Bureau\nof Consular Affairs Report, dated October 10, 2006 (Exhibit 10); and Background Note: Turkey,\nBureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, dated October 2006 (Exhibit 11).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.

He is married\n5\nfor a second time, has two children, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree.   He has no prior military service\n6\nand has held a top-secret security clearance since 1990.7\nApplicant\u2019s current mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and residents\nof Iran.

Applicant\u2019s wife came\nto this country when she was 16 years old, sent here to marry her first cousin, who was 31 years old.\nThey married, had two children, and divorced in 1995.8\nApplicant met his current wife in 1997, and they married in 1998.  Since coming to the U.S.,\nhis wife had not seen her mother in 16 years, and had constantly been concerned about her health\nsince her mother had suffered two heart attacks and a stroke.   Since his mother-in-law was a citizen\n9\nand resident of Iran, and because he held a security clearance, Applicant did not feel it was\nappropriate for him to travel to Iran, so he traveled to Turkey.

I went to Ankara initially with my\nwife, who had an entry/exit passport, or a white passport, since she was, at the time,\nan Iranian citizen.

Since her last visit to\n13\nthe U.S. in 2006, she suffered another heart attack, had quadruple heart bypass surgery, and has a leg\nwound from her ankle to her groin, from the artery graft.  Her doctor told her she cannot travel by\nair, so she cannot travel to the U.S. again, and Applicant no longer needs to travel to Turkey.14\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law, a teacher, had served as the mayor of a small town in\nsouthwestern Iran, in the desert near the Persian Gulf.  The people living in that area of the country\nhave contempt for the Iranian government.   Applicant\u2019s wife has one brother who is unemployed\n15\nand one who is a commercial construction worker.  Neither of their wives is employed.  None of his\nwife\u2019s family have served in the Iranian military.  During the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Iranian\ngovernment confiscated four homes and several ranches belonging to his wife\u2019s family.   His wife\n16\nhas been a U.S. citizen for 18 months and surrendered her Iranian passport.   Applicant does not\n17\ncommunicate with his in-laws.  At his instruction, his wife\u2019s family contacts her on her cell phone\nand not at home.  They do not speak English and he does not speak Farsi.  He has no intention of\ntraveling to Iran.   His wife has never been to his workplace.  She only knows how to reach him by\n18\ntelephone.  \nApplicant\u2019s father worked for the U. S. Air Force for 22 years and maintained a top-secret\nclearance for another 25 years with a defense contractor.  His brother has worked for a defense\ncontractor in a foreign country for the past five years.  He also has a top-secret clearance.  His sister\nhas worked for a defense contractor for 25 years and also carries a top-secret clearance.  \n19\n\nGovernment Exhibit 4 (U.S. Department of State, Consular Information Sheet, Iran, October 11, 2006) at 1;\n20\nGovernment Exhibit 3 (Iran Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Report, dated October 2006 ) at 1; and Government Exhibit\n5 (Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2005: Iran Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Report,\ndated October 12, 2006) at 1 are the sources for this sentence and the next sentence.\nGovernment Exhibit 5, supra n.  17 at 1-28 is the source for this sentence and the next four sentences.\n21\nGovernment Exhibit 8 ( \u201cIran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses,\u201d Congressional Research Service Report, dated\n22\nJune 2, 2006) at 20-21. \nGovernment Exhibit 3, supra n. 21, at 8; Exhibit 6 (Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 6 \u2013 State Sponsors of\n23\nTerror, Overview, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 28, 2006) at 1.\nGovernment Exhibit 6 (Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 6, \u201cState Sponsors of Terror, Overview,\u201d Office of the\n24\nCoordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 28, 2006) at 173.\nId. at 43-44.\n25\n6\nIran is an authoritarian, constitutional, theocratic republic, dominated by the Shi\u2019a Muslim\nclergy.   Islamic law is the basis of the state\u2019s authority.  Human rights violations continue,\n20\nparticularly against journalists who speak out against Iran\u2019s current government, minority religions,\nand political activists, who oppose the current ruling regime.   Serious mistreatment of prisoners\n21\noccurs.  Human rights problems such as summary execution, torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged\nsolitary confinement, and official corruption have been reported.  Although human rights violations\nare prohibited by law, the Iranian government does not enforce the law. \nIran has been the most active state sponsor of terrorism.  It is increasingly involved in\nsupplying lethal assistance to Iraqi militant groups in support of terrorist activity against the U.S.\nforces in Iraq.  Iran supported the June 25, 1996, truck bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi\nArabia, a terrorist act that killed 19 U.S. military personnel and wounded 500.   The current Iranian\n22\ngovernment supports and actively sponsors terrorism by providing resources, guidance and a safe\nhaven to terrorists.   Iran continues to be unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members, and\n23\nhas resisted numerous requests to transfer custody of its al-Qaida detainees to their countries of\norigin or to third countries for interrogation and/or trial.  Iran presents a particular concern, given its\nactive sponsorship of terrorism and its continued development of a nuclear program.  Iran is also\ncapable of producing biological and chemical agents or weapons.  Iran could support terrorist\norganizations seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  \n24\nIn response to a question about threats to his wife\u2019s family members by the Iranian\ngovernment, in an effort to force Applicant to disclose classified information, he responded:\nA.  My wife makes no bones about her disdain for the country of Iran.  And she\nwould alert me immediately if someone approached her, family member or not.  She\ntalks very unfavorably about her brother, who is jobless, and I believe has drug\nissues.  She cannot tolerate the things that go on in that country.  My wife swore\nallegiance to the United States.  She\u2019s a U.S. citizen.  She loves this country.  And\nshe loves what it\u2019s done for her.  She is not approachable.25\n\nId. at 16-23.\n26\n7\nAn operations engineer who worked with Applicant between 1995 and 1998, and again\nbetween 2003 and 2005, stated that he never had any cause for questioning Applicant\u2019s ability to\nsafeguard classified information.  He said that Applicant worked well with some very tough\ncustomers, very demanding customers, and he worked well with them getting technical assistance\nfor their systems and coordinating enhancements.  He described Applicant as patriotic, that he trusted\nhim completely, and he that had no reservations about Applicant having the highest level security\nclearance.26\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n27\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n28\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n8\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses\n27\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.28\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law,\nbrother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Iran.  A sister-in-law\u2019s spouse was the\nmayor of his township in Iran.  Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An\nimmediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or\nobligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) and E2.A2.1.2.1. (Sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for\nadverse foreign influence or duress exists) are applicable.\nHowever, FI DC E2.A2.1.2.3. (Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with\nany foreign government) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law no longer is mayor.  The\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\n30\n9\nresidents in that small town in the southwesterly-most part of the country have contempt for the\nIranian government.  There are no family ties to the Iranian government.\nUnder the Directive, potentially disqualifying conditions may be mitigated through the\napplication of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and/or specific mitigating conditions.  When the\ngovernment produces evidence raising potentially disqualifying conditions, an Applicant has the\nburden to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the conditions.   The\n29\ngovernment never has the burden of disproving a mitigating condition.30\nA security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s immediate family, or other persons to whom\nhe may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S., or may be subject\nto duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information. \nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (A determination that the\nimmediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant,\nor associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States) does not apply.\nTo determine whether Applicant was \u201cin a position to be exploited by a foreign power,\u201d I\nnormally weigh Applicant\u2019s connection to his family against his strong ties to the United States.  I\nnote that Applicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized citizen of the U.S., and therefore entitled to the liberties\nand protection afforded U.S. citizens.  Her family residing in Iran present a somewhat greater\nvulnerability; although they have no connection to or dependence upon a foreign power, they are still\nunder the physical control of the Iranian government.  Applicant\u2019s record of successful employment,\nthe fact that Iran and the U.S. have a poor relationship, and that the Iranian government has an\nabominable human rights record, make it likely that his wife\u2019s family members would be vulnerable\nto improper influence.  \nThe issue of casual contact is more problematic because of Applicant\u2019s five trips to Turkey\nto accompany his mother-in-law to the United States for a visit.  But her recent physical deterioration\nprevents her from coming to the U.S. again, which reduces the concern.  Applicant detailed his\nknowledge of security procedures.  He notified his employer when making these trips, and filed\nfollow-up reports when he returned.  He has insulated himself from his wife\u2019s family, and his wife\ndoesn\u2019t know the physical location of his work-place.  Her family calls her cell phone so he doesn\u2019t\nhave to interact with them.  He doesn\u2019t speak Farsi and has no intention of learning the language.\nAny contact, though infrequent, is nothing more than a \u201chello.\u201d  I find that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3.\n(Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent) to be applicable.  \nWhole Person\n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 3\n31\n(App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n32\nISCR Case No. 03-21423 at 7-10.\n33\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.3.\n34\n10\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  As noted above, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1,\nE2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the\nfacts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual\ncase.  To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any\nperson with ties to persons in a foreign country, contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.\n\u201cAlthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the\nfavorable application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an\napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances (including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still\nwarrant a favorable application of the relevant general factors.\u201d31\nBecause Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law can no longer travel, he has no need to travel to Turkey\nso concerns about foreign influence no longer exist with that country.  On the other hand, Iran, where\nhis in-laws live, presents a more serious concern. \nOne of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors which must be considered is \u201cthe potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d   In that regard, an important factor for consideration is the\n32\ncharacter of any foreign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the\ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  The relationship between a foreign government\nand the U.S. may be relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls\nis likely to attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to against the U.S. through the applicant.  The\nnature of the foreign government might also relate to the question of whether the foreign government\nor an entity it controls would risk jeopardizing its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or\nthreatening its private citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray this country.  A hostile\nrelationship may make it more likely that Iran would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through his\nrelatives or associates.33\nIran is one of the least democratic countries in the Middle East.  Iran and the United States\nhave had poor relations for at least 27 years.  I believe it is probable that Iran would attempt to\nexploit Applicant\u2019s relatives to obtain classified information, and if it did, I believe Applicant would\nproperly notify the authorities.  His wife\u2019s relatives are in a greater risk living in Iran, than other\nMiddle East countries.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\u2013not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions\u2013is the\nheart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.   Indeed, the Appeal\n34\n\nISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2004).\n35\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n36\nSee ISCR Case No.  04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd.  March 5, 2007).\n37\n11\nBoard has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an applicant where no\nspecific mitigating conditions apply.35\nApplicant is a mature individual with 17 years of successful employment while holding a\nsecurity clearance without incident.  Applicant has strong ties to the United States.  Several family\nmembers have held or presently hold top secret security clearances.  Because of Applicant\u2019s deep\nand long-standing relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict\nof interest in favor of the United States.  I find the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress does not constitute a security risk.36\nOf the adjudicative guidelines set out in Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1, supra, only E2.2.1.8. the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, appears to be on point.  However, other\nmatters, such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s\nfamily ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.,\nand many others raised by the facts of a given case can properly be factored in to a judge\u2019s evaluation\nof an applicant\u2019s worthiness of a security clearance.   I considered his age (44), his education which\n37\nincludes a college degree, his employment record, his reasons for travel to Turkey and that those\nreasons no longer exist, his financial stability, and his stable home environment as to whether he is\na good candidate for a security clearance.  He demonstrated that he understood and complied with\nthe reporting requirements for contacts with foreign nationals.   \nI observed Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I find his\ntestimony to be believable and find him to be a sincere and credible witness, because he answered\nquestions directly, completely, and honestly.  He has not traveled to Turkey since 2006, and there\nare no longer reasons for him to contemplate such travel.  He has no contact with his wife\u2019s siblings,\nand he has never discussed his work for his employer with any of her Iranian relatives.  \nApplicant takes his duties seriously, and has demonstrated the self-discipline generally\nrequired for academic and career achievement.  He exercises sound judgment.  I find he is capable\nof maintaining, over a long period of time, a stable, loyal relationship with the U.S. government.  He\nhas shown an ability to cooperate, accommodate, and be part of his employer\u2019s team. \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section\nE2.2.3. leads me to conclude that Applicant is not a security risk, has the ability to protect classified\ninformation, and will exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom\nthe government entrusts its interests.  Therefore, notwithstanding that Foreign Influence Mitigating\nCondition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1., supra, is inapplicable, under the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d, I\nconclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n12\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Foreign influence concerns are raised by the PRC residency and\ncitizenship of his three sisters, one of whom works for the local people\u2019s congress, and by the PRC\ncitizenship of a niece who lived with him for several months in 2006. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 22, 2006, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant\nfiled an initial response to the SOR on July 7, 2006, in which he responded to the allegations and\nrequested a hearing. In a supplemental response dated December 14, 2006, Applicant amended his\nresponses to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g, and indicated he now wanted a decision based on the written record\nwithout a hearing.\nThe government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 24, 2007,\nconsisting of 13 Items (1-13). On January 26, 2007, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to\nApplicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant filed a timely rebuttal\nto the FORM on February 21, 2007. On review, Department Counsel had no objections to\nApplicant's submission. The case was assigned to me on February 28, 2007, to determine whether\nit was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nThe government requested administrative notice be taken of several facts concerning the\nPRC, including that it is an economically powerful country with an authoritarian government\ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party; has a poor human rights record; possesses large and\nincreasingly sophisticated military forces and weapons; is a foreign rival of the U.S.; targets U.S.\nintelligence; may place travelers to the PRC under surveillance; and was known to be an active\ncollector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. Source documents were included in the FORM\nas Items 7 through 12 for administrative notice.\nAuthority to consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery,\nand evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner.).  The DOHA\nAppeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader\nthan judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No. 02-24875 (decided Oct.\n12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error in a DOHA administrative judge taking administrative\n\n3\nnotice of a U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights 2000: Laos, as the document\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was\nprovided in advance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present\nalternative information for the judge to notice.\nIn this case, Applicant had the opportunity to review the source documents and he filed no\nobjections. The State Department publications (Background Note: China; Country Reports on\nHuman Rights Practices-2005 for China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau); and Consular\nInformation Sheet) (Items 7, 8 and 12, respectively), and the Office of the National\nCounterintelligence Executive\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage-2005 (Item 11) may properly be considered as official U.S. government\nreports. The unclassified excerpts from a bipartisan Select Committee of the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives, U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (Item 9) is also accepted, but primarily as a historical reference given its dated\nnature (May 1999). The Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies\u2019 Intelligence Threat\nHandbook (Item 10) is distinguishable as a product of a private contractor at the behest of  the\nInteragency/OPSEC Support Staff. Administrative notice may be taken of non-governmental\nissuances, and will be accepted of this document given the absence of any objections from Applicant.\nWhile the source documents may properly be considered, the government has requested\nnotice of certain facts that may or may not be supported by the documentation. After review of Items\n7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, I agree to take administrative notice of the facts concerning the PRC and\nactivities therein as requested by Department Counsel with the following caveats:\nIn foreign relations, China and the United States have been rivals since the cold\nwar, with particular disagreement on the status of Taiwan, and China has\ncontinued to resist what it considers to be superpower dominance by the United\nStates, despite improving economic relations. The U.S. House\u2019s Select Committee\non U.S. National Security reported in 1999 that the U.S. assisted the PRC in avionics\nmodernization of its jet fighters during the Cold War. In its Background Note: China,\nthe U.S. State Department reports that in the 1970s and 1980s, China maintained its\nconsistent opposition to \u201csuperpower hegemony\u201d but China\u2019s focus was almost\nexclusively on the expansionist actions of the Soviet Union and Soviet proxies, such\nas Vietnam and Cuba. While U.S. China relations are sometimes complicated by\nevents in Taiwan and Hong Kong, since the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9\nin February 1972, the U.S. has supported the Chinese position that all Chinese on\nboth sides of the Taiwan Strait maintain that there is only one China and that Taiwan\nis part of China. Tensions between the countries raised by the Chinese crackdown of\ndissident students in Tiananmen Square and other incidents have not led to a\npermanent disruption in U.S-China relations. Moreover, the U.S. wants China to be\na \u201cglobal partner,\u201d a responsible stakeholder in the international community, and\nChina has been an \u201cimportant partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts\u201d since\nSeptember 2001.\nIndustrial espionage is intelligence-gathering \u201cconducted by a foreign\ngovernment or by a foreign company with direct assistance of a foreign\ngovernment against a private U.S. company for the purpose of obtaining\n\n4\ncommercial secrets. The source document on which Department Counsel relies,\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\nEspionage, 2005, defines industrial espionage as \u201cthe acquisition of sensitive\ninformation that has independent economic value and that the owner has taken\nreasonable measures to protect, regardless of the perpetrator\u2019s country of origin or\nwhether a foreign government agent can be linked to the theft.\u201d Nothing in this\ndefinition suggests that industrial espionage must be conducted directly by or with\nthe direct assistance of a foreign government.\nKnown to be active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000, the\nNational Counterintelligence Center (NACIC)\u2019s 2000 Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists\nTaiwan and China among the active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary\ninformation.  Department Counsel did not request administrative notice of the\nannual report for 2000. In the annual report for 2005 (Item 11), China and Russia are\nspecifically cited as two of the most aggressive collectors for 2005. Taiwan is listed\nas one of the countries sending the most foreign visitors to DOE and DoD facilities\nduring fiscal year 2005, but it is not identified specifically as one of the most active\ncollectors.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s brother (\u00b6 1.a), three\nsisters (\u00b6 1.b), and mother-in-law (\u00b6 1.e) are resident citizens of the PRC; one of his sisters worked\nas a local government representative in the PRC (\u00b6 1.c); a niece who is a citizen of the PRC lived\nwith him in the U.S. (\u00b6 1.d); Applicant was an instructor at a university in the PRC from about\nNovember 1982 to November 1989 (\u00b6 1.f), and his first year of graduate study in the U.S. was\nfinanced by the Chinese university (\u00b6 1.g), and Applicant and his spouse visited family members in\nthe PRC from June 21, 1998 until July 27, 1998 (\u00b6 1.h).\nIn his initial answer, Applicant denied the PRC citizenship and residency of his brother, as\nhis brother had retired to Canada where he was a permanent resident. He admitted his three sisters\nand mother-in-law are resident citizens of the PRC, but denied that a sister\u2019s staff position with the\nlocal people\u2019s congress made her a local government employee. As for his niece, he indicated his\nniece\u2019s stay with him was only transitional, that she was relocating and would be moved out very\nsoon. Applicant admitted he had been employed as a computer languages and systems and signals\ninstructor at the Chinese university before he came to the U.S.; that while his living expenses during\nhis first year in the U.S. were sponsored by the Chinese university, the U.S. institution covered the\nremaining expenses. Applicant acknowledged his and his spouse\u2019s travel to the PRC in 1998 to visit\nhis ill father.\n In his supplemental answer of December 2006, Applicant provided the lease showing that\nhis niece had moved out of his home in July 2006, and of the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992\nunder which he adjusted his status to U.S. permanent resident. In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant\nindicated that the systems and signals course which he taught at the Chinese university was a\n\n5\nbeginner course for biomedical engineering majors that \u201cmainly included the mathematical analyses\nfor general signals, such as biomedical signals.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the documents\nof record, I make the following additional findings.\n\nAn unsigned report of personal subject interview, included as Item 13, gives the date of Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s\n1\nentry as November or December 1990. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, official records or evidence complied or created\nin the regular course of business, other an DoD personnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be received\nand considered without authenticating witnesses, provided the information has been furnished by an investigative agency\npursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense or Agency head concerned, to\nsafeguard classified information within industry under Executive Order 10865. A report of investigation may be received\nwith an authenticating witness. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that the right to object to an ROI may be waived, just\nas a party can waive a hearing. (ISCR 01-23356 App. Bd., Nov. 24, 2003). Applicant did not object to its inclusion in\nthe record. While Item 13 was reviewed and considered, it was afforded less weight than Applicant\u2019s SF 86 and his\nvarious answers in resolving factual discrepancies.\n6\nApplicant\u2019s background and foreign ties\nApplicant was born in the PRC in May 1949. The youngest of six children, he is predeceased\nby his parents as well as by the elder of his two brothers. His other brother (age 66) is a PRC citizen\nbut a legal permanent resident of Canada since December 1, 2003. Applicant\u2019s three sisters (ages\n72, 68, and 61) are resident citizens of the PRC.\nApplicant and his spouse, also a native of the PRC, married in March 1977. They had a son\nin November 1981. After three years of graduate study at a scientific and technological university\n(hereafter \u201cChinese university\u201d) in the PRC, Applicant was awarded his master of science degree in\nMarch 1982. For the next seven years, Applicant was a lecturer/instructor at the Chinese university\nwhere he taught courses in computer languages and a beginner level course for biomedical\nengineering majors that focused on mathematical analyses for general, biomedical signals.\nIn about November 1989, Applicant came to the U.S. to pursue technical research in\nbiomedical engineering at a renowned medical school.  The Chinese university financed  much of\n1\nthe cost of his first year with the remainder covered by the U.S. medical school. Under the terms of\nthe sponsorship, Applicant was to return to the Chinese university after one year.\nOn April 11, 1990, the President of the United States issued Executive Order 12711. It\ndirected the Attorney General to take any steps necessary to defer until January 1, 1994, the enforced\ndeparture of all PRC nationals and their dependents who were in the U. S. on or after June 5, 1989,\nup to an including the date of the order. These PRC nationals were allowed to maintain lawful status\nin the U.S. without a valid passport through January 1, 1994. Applicant continued his research at the\nU.S. medical school and cut his financial ties to the Chinese university. In mid-August 1992, he\nbegan working as a software programmer at an institute affiliated with the medical school. On\nOctober 1, 1992, the U.S. Congress passed the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992. It provided\nfor the acquisition of U.S. permanent residency status for those PRC nationals who had resided\ncontinuously in the U.S. since April 11, 1990, and were not physically present in the PRC for longer\nthan 90 days between April 11, 1990 and October 1, 1992, unless conditions permitted their safe\nreturn to the PRC as certified by the President. Applicant took advantage of that statute and acquired\nlawful permanent residence in the U.S. in 1993.\nFrom January 1997 to November 1998, Applicant was employed as a software engineer for\nthe medical institute. On April 15, 1998, he was issued his PRC passport, which was valid until April\n14, 2003. On June 21, 1998, Applicant, his spouse, and their son traveled to the PRC to see his 93-\n\n7\nyear-old father, who was very ill. They visited with other family members as well during their five-\nweek stay. Applicant did not return to the PRC when his father died in 2001.\nIn late November 1998, Applicant went to work as a senior systems analyst for his current\nemployer. On February 6, 2003, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, taking an oath to renounce all\nforeign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or\nperform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. His spouse\nbecame a U.S. citizen in March 2003 and his son in August 2003.\nNeeding a clearance for his duties with the defense contractor, Applicant executed a security\nclearance application (SF 86) on January 25, 2005. He disclosed the PRC births of his parents and\neldest brother who were all deceased, and the PRC citizenship and residency of the sister closest to\nhim in age. He indicated that his other siblings (two sisters and one brother) and mother-in-law were\nPRC citizens but indicated  \u201cUnknown\u201d as to their addresses. Applicant also disclosed his foreign\nemployment for the Chinese university as a lecturer from January 1982 to November 1989, his\npossession of a valid PRC passport from April 15, 1998 to April 14, 2003, and his trip to the PRC\nin June/July 1998. He also disclosed a pleasure trip to Canada for two days in February 2004.\nOn February 21, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator about his foreign ties. Applicant discussed his employment at the Chinese\nuniversity before he came to the U.S. in 1989, but averred he had not maintained any contact with\nanyone from the university. Supposed to return to the PRC after one year of research, he  remained\nin the U.S. as Congress passed a law that allowed Chinese students to stay without having to return\nto China to complete their two years of residency. Applicant denied dual citizenship with the U.S.\nand China as he understood China does not recognize dual citizenship. His PRC passport was no\nlonger valid, although he was not certain whether it became invalid automatically on him acquiring\nU.S. citizenship or on its expiration in November 2003. Applicant told the OPM investigator he had\ntelephone contact with his family members in China: with his  brother  two or three times per year,\nwith the youngest of his sisters five times per year, and with his other sisters two or three times per\nyear. He also indicated he had in-person contact with his brother in Canada in 2004, and with his\nsisters when he went to China in 1998. The interviewer reported that  Applicant further indicated his\nbrother worked as an engineer for a Chinese television station in China, that his youngest sister was\nemployed by the local government as a representative, and that his other sisters had been university\nprofessors until their retirements. Applicant denied that his spouse had a close relationship with her\nmother, who is also a resident citizen of the PRC, and described her contact with her mother as\nlimited to once every year or two. Applicant, his spouse, and their son, visited her mother when they\nwent to the PRC in 1998. Applicant also described monthly contact with a nephew (son of his eldest\nsister), who is a naturalized U.S. citizen living in the U.S. and working for the federal government.\nA niece (daughter of his youngest sister) had been in the U.S. for three or four years. She had moved\nthe week before to Applicant\u2019s area for a job and was residing with Applicant temporarily while\nlooking for an apartment. Applicant denied any preference, sympathy, or alliance with any foreign\ninterests and that he could be placed under duress because of his contacts with family members in\nthe PRC.\nWhen he filed his initial response to the SOR in July 2006, Applicant indicated that his\nbrother retired \u201cyears ago,\u201d and was living in Canada as a lawful permanent resident; that the\nyoungest of his three sisters was a part-time staff member of an office in the local people\u2019s congress,\n\nThe National People\u2019s Congress is the PRC\u2019s legislative body and the highest organ of state power in the PRC.\n2\nSee U.S. State Department\u2019s Background Note: China  (Item 7). Under the election law, citizens have the opportunity\nto vote for local people\u2019s congress representatives at the county level and below, although in most cases the nomination\nof candidates in those elections was strictly controlled in 2005. See Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2005\nfor China (Item 8 p.25). While local subgovernmental village committees are not considered government bodies, the\nlocal people\u2019s congress is regarded as a legislative body. The State Department reports that beginning in late 2002, a\npractice began of naming local Chinese Communist Party secretaries to serve concurrently as head of the local people\u2019s\ncongress, a move that dramatically strengthened party control over these legislatures. (Id.).\n8\nwhich he maintained was not a government office. He provided proof showing his brother acquired\nCanadian permanent residency in December 2003, which in light of his brother\u2019s age, leads me to\nconclude that Applicant was likely talking about his brother\u2019s past employment during the subject\ninterview. It is less clear whether Applicant\u2019s brother was in the PRC as of February 2006. There is\nno evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s representation that his brother was living in Canada as of July\n2006. Applicant\u2019s claim of his sister being on staff of the local people\u2019s congress is considered a\nfurther clarification of her employment in the PRC. It is not clear whether Applicant told the OPM\ninvestigator that his sister worked as a \u201crepresentative\u201d for the local government without naming the\npeople\u2019s congress, which is a local legislative entity.  \n2\nAs of July 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse had contacted her mother in the PRC \u201cseveral times\u201d\nto check on her health. Applicant did not speak with his mother-in-law. Applicant\u2019s niece was\nemployed in the U.S. by the same university where Applicant had conducted his research in the early\n1990s. She resided in Applicant\u2019s home from about February 2006 to mid-July 2006 when she found\nher own apartment.\nThe PRC\u2019s political and economic state\nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion\npeople and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government\ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The National People\u2019s Congress, the PRC\u2019s legislative\nbody, is the highest organ of state power. In 2002, a practice began of naming local Chinese\nCommunity Party secretaries to serve concurrently as head of the local people\u2019s congresses. This\nmove has strengthened Communist Party control over these legislatures. During 2005, the PRC\ngovernment\u2019s human rights record remained poor, with a trend toward increased harassment,\ndetention, and imprisonment by government and security authorities of those perceived as\nthreatening to government authority. Foreign visitors in the PRC may be placed under surveillance\nby security personnel, their hotel rooms, telephones, and facsimile machines monitored, and their\npersonal possessions, including computers, searched without their knowledge or consent.\nThe PRC possesses large military forces (strategic nuclear forces, army, navy and air force),\nwhich are in the process of transformation into a smaller, more mobile, high tech military. The PRC\nacquired some advanced weapon systems from Russia but much of its air and naval forces continue\nto be based on 1960s era technology. The U.S. has made significant, tangible progress with the PRC\non nuclear nonproliferation. The PRC was the first state to pledge \u201cno first use\u201d of nuclear weapons.\nWhile Taiwan has complicated the relationship and been a source of discord between the\nU.S. and PRC at times, the U.S. formally recognizes the government of the PRC as the sole legal\ngovernment of China. Since Tiananmen, the PRC has sought a higher international profile through\n\n9\nits seat as a permanent member of the United Nations, and through diplomatic relations with other\ncountries. The U.S. and PRC have a history of cooperation on scientific, environmental and more\nrecently counterterrorism. China is an important trading partner of the U.S. Its trade surplus with the\nU.S. was $201.6 billion in 2005.\nIn an effort to acquire advanced technology, the PRC has aggressively targeted sensitive and\nprotected U.S. economic and militarily critical information. The PRC blends intelligence and non-\nintelligence assets, relying on covert espionage activity by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and\nby  targeting ethnic Chinese who have access to sensitive information.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at\n527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014foreign influence\nApplicant\u2019s sisters are resident citizens of the PRC. His brother is also a citizen of the PRC,\nalthough he also has permanent residency in Canada and was living in Canada as of July 2006.\nApplicant has two to three times yearly telephone contact with his two older sisters and his brother,\nand about five times yearly contact with the youngest sister. He visited his siblings when he was\nin the PRC in 1998 and with his brother in Canada in 2004. Applicant also provided a home for his\nniece from late January/early February 2006 to mid-July 2006. She is a PRC citizen as well.\nDisqualifying condition \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign\ncountry, applies.\n\nSee MC E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family members(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,\n3\ndaughters, brothers, sisters) cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position\nto be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States. The mitigating condition is bifurcated in nature [\u201cA determination that the immediate\nfamily member(s). . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. . . .\u201d]. To\nconstrue the conjunction \u201cor\u201d as \u201cand\u201d would be against the plain language. While MC E2.A2.1.3.1. can be applied if\nan applicant satisfies only one of the two parts, a given adjudicative condition (either disqualifying or mitigating) cannot\nbe read in such a way to be inconsistent with other adjudicative conditions. Under Guideline B, if foreign relations, who\nare not government agents or employees, are in a position to be exploited then MC E2.A2.1.3.1. does not mitigate the\nforeign influence concerns. \n10\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held it reasonable for the administrative judge to consider the\nsignificance not only of an applicant\u2019s ties, but also of his spouse\u2019s ties to a foreign country and the\npossible effect they may have on Applicant\u2019s contacts under Guideline B (see ISCR Case No. 01-\n02452, App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002). Applicant\u2019s spouse is also a native of the PRC. Applicant told an\nOPM investigator in February 2006 that his spouse did not have a close relationship with her\nmother, and that she had rare telephone contact with her, once every year or two. However, he\nindicated more recently in July 2006 that while he does not have contact with his mother-in-law,\nhis spouse \u201ccalls her several times to check her health condition.\u201d Accordingly, DC \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.2.\nSharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the\npotential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists, also applies.\nThe government\u2019s case for DC \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.3. Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are\nconnected with any foreign government is based on Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s staff position with the local\npeople\u2019s congress, which Department Counsel submits is \u201cconnected with the Communist regime\nthat controls the PRC.\u201d (FORM at 7). The supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party over all\nother government, military, and civilian entities is well documented (see Item 8 at 25, \u201cBeginning\nin late 2002, a practice began of naming local CCP secretaries to serve concurrently as the head of\nthe local people\u2019s congress, a move that dramatically strengthened party control over these\nlegislatures.\u201d). However, it is his sister\u2019 employment with the local people\u2019s congress, a legislative\nbody, which triggers DC \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.3., rather than any connection or influence with a political\nparty, although clearly there is an increased risk because of the pervasive influence of the Chinese\nCommunist Party even at the local level. DC \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.6. Conduct which may make the\nindividual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government, must also be\nconsidered, given Applicant\u2019s trip to the PRC in 1998 to visit his relatives and U.S. State\nDepartment reports of PRC security personnel targeting foreign visitors without their knowledge\nor consent (see Item 12).\nIn light of the existing foreign connections, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion as\nto whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. The\nDirective provides for mitigation where the family members and/or close associates are not agents\nof a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nApplicant to choose between loyalty to them and the United States (see \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.).  As\n3\naffirmed by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR 02-14995 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004), both prongs must\nbe satisfied to meet this mitigating condition. Applicant has failed to satisfy either.\n\nThe phrase \"agent of a foreign power\" is a statutory term of art defined in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b). It does not\n4\ninclude a person who is simply employed by a foreign government, unless they are so employed in the U.S., or they are\nengaged in intelligence gathering or terrorism. The federal statute dealing with national security and access to classified\ninformation, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6), adopted the definitions of \u201cforeign power\u201d and \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d from 50\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1801.While I am not persuaded that the term \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d should be more expansively defined\nthan as set forth in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b) and by reference 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6), I am required to follow Appeal Baord\nprecedent.\n11\nThe term \"agent of a foreign power\" is not defined in the Directive.  The DOHA Appeal\n4\nBoard has not defined the term, but has issued decisions explaining it. \"An employee of a foreign\ngovernment need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military,\nor other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign power for purposes of Foreign Influence\nMitigating Condition 1.\"( ISCR Case No. 02-24254, App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004). In declining to adopt\nthe definition of \u201cforeign agent\u201d set forth in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C.\n\u00a71801 (b), the Board suggested that  \"agent\" could include a person whose activities are directly or\nindirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in part by a foreign\nprincipal. (ISCR Case No. 03-10954, App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006).\nNothing is known about Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s specific position and duties for the local people\u2019s\ncongress.  While the risk associated with her job is likely primarily under the second prong of \u00b6\nE2.A2.1.3.1 (in position to be exploited), I cannot state conclusively that she is not an agent of a\nforeign power. Applicant\u2019s other sisters are retired university professors. There is no indication they\nare currently agents of a foreign power, although there is a heightened risk of undue coercion\nbecause of their past academic positions where their activities were likely to be noticed by\ngovernmental or Party authorities. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law did not work outside the home.\nAlthough not specifically stated in the adjudicative guideline, the particular foreign country\nof which the close relative or associate is a citizen or resides is relevant in determining the\nlikelihood of undue influence being brought to bear on its citizens/residents. Countries with strong\ndemocratic institutions and respect for the rule of law are generally regarded as presenting less of\na risk than totalitarian regimes with a record of human rights abuses, support for terrorist activities,\nor hostility to the U.S. The PRC has a poor human rights record and a history of targeting the U.S.\nto obtain sensitive and protected technologies. Applicant has not lived in the PRC since late 1989,\nand while his first year of research in the U.S. was funded in part by the Chinese university where\nhe served as an instructor in computer languages and biomedical signals and systems before he\ncame to the U.S., he has not had any tie, financial or otherwise, to the Chinese university since then.\nYet his  present employment with a defense contractor, especially given his past affiliation with the\nChinese university, makes him an attractive target. In the absence of any indication that Applicant\nplans to travel to the PRC in the future, the risk of undue foreign influence is primarily through his\nsisters in the PRC. The risk is substantially lessened with respect to his brother, who is a legal\nresident of Canada. Applicant\u2019s niece is similarly removed from the physical reach of the PRC\nmilitary and security authorities, but her visa status in the U.S. is unknown. \nCommon sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more\nvulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative is improperly influenced, brought under\ncontrol, or even used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service. Even though his\nspouse has contacted her mother several times to check on her health, Applicant is not likely to\njeopardize the life he has enjoyed in the U.S. for his  mother-in-law, who is 91 and in ill health. He\n\n12\nhas no personal relationship with her. In contrast, despite his limited contact with his sisters in the\nPRC (telephone contact from two to five times yearly depending on the sister), there is sufficient\nevidence of a bond with these siblings through his calls, his visit with them in 1998, and his\nassistance in providing a temporary home for his youngest sister\u2019s daughter. His niece lived with\nhim for several months in 2006 until she found her own apartment. While Applicant may well have\nseen this niece only twice in person before she came to the U.S., it is reasonable to infer that they\ndeveloped a relationship over the months she resided in his home. MC \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3. Contact and\ncorrespondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent, does not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d \u00b6 E2.2.1. Applicant\nhas established significant bonds to the U.S., most notably citizenship in 2003 and continuous\nemployment since August 1992. He has traveled to the PRC only once in the past ten years, which\nwas in 1998 to see his ill father. Yet primarily because of his bond to his sisters who are resident\ncitizens of the PRC\u2014a circumstance clearly beyond his control\u2014there is an unacceptable risk of\nundue foreign influence. With so little known about his relatives\u2019 activities and associations in the\nPRC, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\naccess.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

She now has an agreement with\nthe original credit card company, and has started making payments as agreed.  Applicant has\nmitigated eligibility concerns based on her finances.  Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 23, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny Applicant eligibility for an information\nsystems position designated ADP I/II/III.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR\non August 29, 2006.  The SOR alleges eligibility concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 9, 2006.  She admitted both allegations\nunder Guideline F, but denied the eligibility concern.  She provided an explanation for her delinquent\ndebts.  She elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 20, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on March 23, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  She timely responded with additional information.  On May 23, 2007, Department\nCounsel responded that there was no objection to consideration of the additional material.  The case\nwas assigned to me on May 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She has worked for this\nemployer for over seven years.  She is married with two grown children.  She submitted a\nquestionnaire for a public trust position on August 18, 2004.   \n1\nCredit reports of October 9, 2004,  May 2, 2006,  and August 15, 2006,  and Applicant\u2019s own\n2\n3\n4\nadmission, shows she has two delinquent credit card accounts with the same creditor for $5,758, and\n\nItem 2, (Response to SOR, dated October 9, 2006); Response to FORM, undated (received April 30, 2007).\n5\nSee, Response to FORM, undated (received April 30, 2007), with attachments.\n6\nId.\n7\n3\n$6,780, totaling $12,538.  All of her other active and open debts are either closed or paid as agreed.\nApplicant incurred the delinquent credit card debts starting in 2003 when she and her\nhusband were having marital difficulties.  They lived in the same house but her husband ceased\nproviding financial support for the family.  Applicant also experienced medical problems which\nwould incapacitate her at times.  Her condition was later diagnosed as sleep apnea.  These two\nproblems caused her to be depressed.  Constant inquiries and telephone calls from the credit\ncompany also added to her depression.  As a result of her condition and realizing her credit with the\ncredit card company was already ruined, she stopped making payment on the two credit cards.  She\ncontinued to make payments on her other accounts keeping them current.  Applicant was not using\nthe two credit cards, but the balances were increasing because of interest, penalties, and late fees.5\nApplicant attempted to pay the delinquent debts starting in mid-2006.  She contacted the\ncredit card company and learned the account had been transferred to a collection agency.  The\ncollection agency told her they would only accept a lump sum payment of 70% of the debt to settle\nand close the account.  She contacted the credit card company and was informed the account was\ntransferred to another collection agency.  She sought advise from a credit assistance agency but was\nadvised they could not assist her since the account was in collection.  She informed the credit\ncounselors of the problems she had paying the collection agency.  They advised her to send the new\ncollection agency a payment arrangement letter with a check for the first payment.  If the collection\nagency cashed the check, they would be agreeing to the proposed payment arrangement.  She sent\nthe letter, the check was cashed, and she continued to send checks bi-weekly for payment from\nSeptember 2006 to April 2007.\nIn April 2007, she requested from the collection agency a letter confirming her payments.\nThey told her they received only one payment.  Applicant had the cancelled checks she sent for\npayment, and forwarded them with her response to the FORM to establish that payments were made.\nThe credit agency told her they would no longer handle her account and would return the file to the\noriginal credit card company.  The credit card company credited her with all payments.  The credit\ncard company agreed to a payment plan, and Applicant has made regular payments on this plan.6\nApplicant has an excellent work record.  She received recognition for suggesting\nimprovements to the claims processing system.  Her work performance ratings have been \u201cExceeds\nExpectations.\u201d  She presented letters from family, friends, and co-workers attesting to her work\nperformance, honesty, and reliability.7\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . .\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n9\nDoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8.\n10\nDoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n11\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n12\n4\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   To be eligible to occupy an information\n8\nsystems position designated ADP I/II/III, an applicant must meet the guidelines contained in the\nRegulation.  The standard that must be met is that based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.9\nThe Regulation sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making trustworthiness\ndeterminations.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.\nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a\nperson may behave in other aspects of life.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nof recurrence.10\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the rights to the procedures contained in the DoD\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   Initially, the\n11\nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may\ndisqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access a public trust position.   Thereafter,\n12\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n14\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n15\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n16\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n5\nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.   An\n13\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue her eligibility.\u201d   \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational\n14\nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\n15\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d   Each eligibility decision must\n16\nbe fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation, Appendix 8.  A\nperson granted eligibility for an information systems position enters into a special relationship with\nthe government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose individuals to whom it grants eligibility to occupy an information systems position designated\nADP I/II/III.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility for the position is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n17\nmet the strict guidelines have established for issuing such eligibility.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts reported by credit reports and admitted by Applicant brings the\nmatter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (an inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts).  Applicant accumulated delinquent debt because she did not make required payments\non two credit card debts.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.\nI considered Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 (The\nbehavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It was an isolated incident).  Applicant has not\nsatisfied the debts, and only recently started to make payments on the debts .  Even though the debts\nare with the same credit card company, the debts are for two different credit cards.  The debts are not\nrecent and not isolated, since they are long standing, not paid, and from two sources.  The mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nApplicant incurred the delinquent debt because of marital problems and a medical condition\nraising FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\n\n6\ndeath, divorce, or separation).  Applicant and her husband had marital problems that caused him to\nstop contributing to the family\u2019s needs.  However, it was within her control to require her husband\nto provide for his family or make changes in the family requirements because of the marital problem\nand the husband\u2019s lack of support.  While her sleep apnea is a valid medical condition, it did not\naffect her ability to pay all of her debts.  It was her decision not to pay the delinquent credit card\ndebts.  Her marital and medical problems were not sufficient to mitigate the eligibility concerns.  \nI considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  For this mitigating condition to apply, there must be\nan \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a good-faith effort to repay.\nA systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  Applicant is paying all of her debts as\nagreed except two credit card debts.  She attempted to start a payment plan with the collection\nagencies but they were not cooperative.  She made payments to one collection agency but they did\nnot acknowledge she made payments even though she had cancelled checks to prove payment.  She\nnow has an agreed payment plan with the original credit card agency and is making payments on that\nplan.  Appellant developed a systematic, concrete plan to pay her past-due obligations.  Her other\ndebts are current and being paid on time.  Appellant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a\nstrong desire to pay them, and has made a good effort to pay them.  Her finances  are stable.  She is\nliving within her means and not incurring additional debts.  Appellant has a concrete plan to\novercome her financial problems, and she is not a security risk.  Appellant has established her good-\nfaith efforts to resolve her debts, and has mitigated security concerns based on her financial situation.\nI conclude under the circumstances Appellant  has shown a good-faith effort to repay her past due\nobligations.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is eligible for a position of public trust.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant or continue eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties for\nApplicant.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 66 years old, divorced, with two adult children (ages 51 and 49). She works for a defense contractor in the health insurance business as a customer service representative. She is a native-born U.S. citizen. She lives alone since her stepfather died, and has no desire to travel outside the U.S. again, to Australia or anywhere else. (Tr. 29, 36, 38, 39; Exhibit 1, Answer) Applicant visited Australia in 1974 on vacation and liked the topography, climate, and its people. She stayed for 30 days, then returned to her home in the U.S. Applicant was a computer programmer then and could find work in Australia. She applied for residency and obtained a job with an Australian company. She left her 18 and 16 year-old sons here in the U.S. when she moved to Australia. She worked for that company for nine months. Then, she found a job with another company and worked there for 13 years until 1990, when the company moved its information technology operations to Singapore from Australia. She traveled throughout the Pacific region for business while employed with that company. She used her U.S. passport for that travel because it was the only passport she had until 1992.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 66 years old, divorced, and has two adult sons.  She lived for 26 years in\nAustralia, holding a U.S. passport and citizenship the entire time.  In 1990, she understood the U.S.\nchanged its policy to allow U.S. citizens to hold Australian citizenship also.  She became an\nAustralian citizen and obtained a passport.  In 2000, she returned to the U.S. to live again in her\nhome state permanently.  Applicant mitigated the foreign preference trustworthiness concern.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On August 15, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 2, 2006, and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on May 2,\n2007.  On June 1, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government\nand the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on June 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 66 years old, divorced, with two adult children (ages 51 and 49).  She works for\na defense contractor in the health insurance business as a customer service representative.  She is a\nnative-born U.S. citizen.  She lives alone since her stepfather died, and has no desire to travel outside\nthe U.S. again, to Australia or anywhere else. (Tr. 29, 36, 38, 39; Exhibit 1, Answer)\nApplicant visited Australia in 1974 on vacation and liked the topography, climate, and its\npeople.  She  stayed for 30 days, then returned to her home in the U.S.  Applicant was a computer\nprogrammer then and could find work in Australia.  She applied for residency and obtained a job\nwith an Australian company.  She left her 18 and 16 year-old sons here in the U.S. when she moved\nto Australia.  She worked for that company for nine months.  Then, she found a job with another\ncompany and worked there for 13 years until 1990, when the company moved its information\ntechnology operations to Singapore from Australia.  She traveled throughout the Pacific region for\nbusiness while employed with that company.  She used her U.S. passport for that travel because it\nwas the only passport she had until 1992. (Tr. 21, 26-29, 33, 36; Exhibits 1-5)\nWhile living in Australia, she married an English citizen who lived in Australia.  They were\nmarried from 1986 to 1990.  She lived in Australia until April 2000, when she returned to live in the\nU.S. because she missed her father and other family members.  She claims she loves the U.S. more\nthan Australia, which why she returned home in 2000.  She always intended to return to the U.S.,\nbut did not do so earlier because she was married and had a job in Australia.  After June 1990 she\nread in a publication in Australia that the U.S. Government henceforth allowed U.S. citizens to\n\n4\nobtain dual citizenship with Australia.  She thought she should obtain Australian citizenship because\nshe lived there and wanted to live by the law of Australia because she was there.  She would not have\napplied for it if she thought the U.S. Government would not allow her to have it.  Applicant claims\nshe did not swear allegiance to Australia, but only affirmed she would obey its laws.  She voted once\nin an Australian election because the law there requires citizens to vote.  She has voted in another\nAustralian election over the internet from the U.S. after 2000, then learned she does not have to vote\nto avoid breaking Australian law if she is not in the country physically.  She will not vote in an\nAustralian election again.  She voted once in a U.S. election by absentee ballot since 1974.\nApplicant would renounce her Australian citizenship to keep her job and resolve any doubts about\nher trustworthiness, but has taken no overt action to renounce her Australian citizenship. (Tr. 17-27,\n29, 30-33, 35, 37; Exhibits 1, 2)\nApplicant obtained an Australian passport in 1992.  It expired in 2002, and Applicant retains\nthe expired passport.  She used her U.S. passport for travel in the Pacific region for work with her\nformer husband, and pleasure trips from 1974 to 2002, and after then.  Her boyfriend suggested she\nget an Australian passport and she did.  Then they traveled to England in December 1992, and she\nused it for that trip, which included travel through the English Channel Tunnel to France.  She used\nthat passport to travel to Singapore in 1996.  Applicant did use her Australian passport to depart\nAustralia and her U.S. passport on her return on one trip.  Applicant would never live in Australia\nagain, but might visit there again to see her friends.  Applicant has neither her U.S. nor her\nAustralian passports because they expired and she burned them some time after June 2006 when she\nsubmitted copies of both passports to the Government in answer to written interrogatories. (Tr. 20-\n24, 31, 33 38; Exhibits 2-5)\nApplicant claims she did not read carefully her statement to the Government investigator\nbefore she signed it on May 25, 2005.  She did not write it, the investigator did, and she reviewed\nit before signing it.  Applicant declared above her signature that \u201cThis document is true and complete\nto the best of my knowledge and belief and is made of my own free will. . .\u201d  The statements about\nretaining her Australian citizenship and returning there to live again, she claims are inaccurate.  She\nsaid her \u201cheart rather than her head\u201d talked for her.  Now she claims her future does not include\n\u201cmoving around the world.\u201d  Her present assertions were made at the hearing.  Statements at the\nbottom of page three and the top of page four concerning no associations with \u201csaboteurs, spies,\nrevolutionist secret agents\u201d are not terms commonly used by someone with a high school education\nas Applicant has, therefore, they were written by someone else. (Tr. 18, 19, 36; Exhibit 2)\nApplicant\u2019s uncle testified as to her trustworthiness and character as he knows them.  He has\nknown Applicant all her life.  He is the younger brother of Applicant\u2019s late stepfather. (Tr. 40-49)\nTaking notice of historical facts, Australia has a parliamentary government with free elections\nand civil rights based on English common law.  It is part of the British Commonwealth of Nations,\nformer British colonies who are independent countries.  Australia has been a strong and consistent\nally of the U.S. since at least 1914.  The U.S. and Australia are members of the ANZUS treaty pact\nfor self defense in the Southwest Pacific region, formed after World War II.  Australia is a member\nof the international coalition fighting with the U.S. in Iraq presently.  The U.S. and Australia fought\ntogether against Japanese aggression during World War II in the Pacific Ocean.  Australia does not\nconduct industrial, political, economic, or military espionage against the U.S.\n\n5\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\n\n6\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference: The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nE2.A3.1.1\nApplicable also is the Memorandum of August 16, 2000, entitled \u201cGuidance of DoD Central\nAdjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of Foreign Preference Adjudicative\nGuidelines,\u201d by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and\nIntelligence (ASDC3I), commonly known as the \u201cMoney Memo..  This memorandum guidance\nstates that \npossession and/or use of a foreign passport may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no\nmitigating factor related to the applicant\u2019s personal convenience, safety, requirements of\nforeign law, or the identify of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigating factor\naddresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.\nThe security concerns underlying this guideline are that the possession and use of a foreign\npassport in preference to a U.S. passport raised doubt as to whether the person\u2019s allegiance\nto the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by\nthe United States.  Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any\nclearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains\nofficial approval for is use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference:  Applicant went off on an adventure in 1974.  She\ntraveled from her home to Australia, liked it there, and decided to stay.  That adventure lasted until\n2000, when she realized that she should return to the U.S. to be with her stepfather and other family\nmembers.  All the time she was in Australia she maintained her U.S. citizenship and a passport.  In\n\n7\n1990 she believed she could obtain dual citizenship with Australia because of change in U.S. policy.\nI believe her explanation that she read about the change in policy in a publication, and proceeded to\ntake advantage of that new policy.  So she obtained that citizenship to make it easier for her to travel\nfrom Australia and return there as part of her work. She always loved the U.S., but obviously liked\nAustralia enough to remain there for 26 years.  But she has lived in the U.S. for the past seven years,\na total of 41 of her 66 years of life.  Now she is caught between these two countries in her desire to\nobtain a favorable trustworthiness determination so she can retain her job.\nBased on the total facts adduced at the hearing and in the documents, I conclude the\nGovernment made a case for applying Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (The exercise of dual\ncitizenship E2.A3.1.2.1), DC 2 (Possession and/or use of a foreign passport E2.A3.1.2.2), DC 5\n(Residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements E2.A3.1.2.5), and DC 8 (Voting\nin foreign elections E2.A3.1.2.8).  Applicant did not surrender her Australian passport to the\nAustralian consul or embassy, as the Money Memo requires.  She burned both it and her expired\nU.S. passport sometime between June 2006 and the hearing date.\nOn the other side of the foreign preference issue, Applicant showed MC 4 (Individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship E2.A3.1.3.4) should apply.  She now declares\nshe will renounce her Australian citizenship.  She has returned to the U.S.  Applicant burned her\nAustralian passport.  She credibly showed at the hearing she had no desire to go traveling again.  I\nbelieve she did burn it out of ignorance as to the proper procedures for disposing of it, which would\nbe to return it to the Australian Government with a renunciation of her citizenship.  Therefore, she\ndoes not possess it nor can she use it.\nThe issue is whether the total evidence shows Applicant has a preference for Australia over\nthe U.S.  I conclude she does not have such a current preference.  Her preference based on her\nstatements, her voluntary return to live and work in the U.S. in 2000, her present age, is for the U.S.\nAustralia was a Shangri-la for Applicant that has now faded in the face of her age, desire to be with\nher family, and her true love for the U.S.  She did not obtain Australian citizenship in the first 16\nyears of living there.  If she had taken Australian citizenship after living there a minimum period of\ntime, and renounced her U.S. citizenship at that time, that series of actions would indicate a\npreference to abandon the U.S. and prefer Australia.  She waited to take out Australian citizenship\nuntil she honestly thought the U.S. Government would allow her legally to obtain dual citizenship.\nIf the U.S. Government had never allowed dual citizenship, then she would not have taken\nAustralian citizenship.  She acted solely on that basis, I conclude.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case,\nI have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nLooking at the factors involved in the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d Applicant lived in Australia\nfor 26 years, and took out citizenship there and a passport in 1990 and 1992, respectively.  She was\nan adult when she did it, based on the information she claims she had.  She liked Australia, so chose\n\n8\nto live there while maintaining her U.S. citizenship.  Now she has returned to the U.S. to live\npermanently.  There is no likelihood Australian officials would coerce, pressure or exploit Applicant\nfor information on the military health care system or its participants.  She took out Australian\ncitizenship on the understanding the U.S. had no objection to it, and because she lived there for\nyears, as others might live in European countries, for example, and not be influenced by those\ngovernments.  My common sense determination is that Applicant cannot be influenced by Australia,\na strong U.S. ally.  She is trustworthy, and, neither she nor Australia are a threat to the U.S.  This\nanalysis is in addition to the conclusions I made in the prior guideline section.  \nApplicant did not, and does not, prefer Australia over the U.S.  Her prior statement to the\ninvestigator is now diminished in persuasiveness because she has had two years to think about her\nintentions and life.  Her testimony at the hearing I conclude is more persuasive and credible about\nher actions and future intentions.  Therefore, I conclude the foreign preference and \u201cwhole person\nanalysis\u201d for Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\n\n9\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

While in Taiwan, he voted in an election. Applicant had a Taiwan passport\nwhich he used on three occasions. His foreign passport has now been destroyed. In 2004, Applicant\ncompleted a Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86. When he completed his SF 86,\nhe failed to indicate he had a foreign passport or had visited a foreign country during the prior seven\nyears. Applicant\u2019s answers were not intentional falsifications. Applicant no longer has ties with\nTaiwan and has expressed a willingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. The record evidence\nis sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from foreign\npreference and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted\nor continued due to foreign preference and personal conduct security concerns.\nOn April 28, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On June 14, 2007,\nI was assigned the case. On July 5, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing held on July\n24, 2007.  At the hearing, Government presented five exhibits (Gov Ex).  Applicant testified, as did\none other witness.  Applicant submitted no exhibits.  Applicant\u2019s counsel asked that ISCR Case No.\n00-0275 (Dated October 30, 2000) be considered. On August 1, 2007, DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for foreign preference and personal conduct.

(Tr. 47, 68) In December 1991, Applicant became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen and obtained a U.S. passport. \nFollowing graduation from university, Applicant looked for a teaching position in academia.\nFinding a lack of jobs in the U.S., he obtained a position as a visiting scholar/associate professor at\na private university in Taiwan. He was employed there from August 1993 through June 1996. As\nan associate professor, he taught general physics and obtained grants from a national science council\nto pay for equipment and the hiring of graduate assistants. (Gov Ex 5) Grants were necessary to run\nlabs and conduct research projects. He did not have to be a Taiwanese citizen to obtain the grants.\n(Tr. 45) In February 1994, Applicant and his wife traveled on vacation to Hong Kong during\nChinese New Year using his Taiwanese passport. \nApplicant has been married 19 years and has one son who was born in the U.S.  Both his\nwife and son are U.S. citizens. (Tr. 33) He met his wife when he was in school. (Tr. 67) \nIn May 1995, he voted in an election in Taiwan. Applicant voted for the status quo party\nbecause he knew the U.S. government favored the status quo and did not favor independence for\nTaiwan. (Tr. 55)\n In 1995, Applicant decided he did not want a teaching career in physics.  In 1996,\nApplicant\u2019s father retired as a professor at a Taiwanese university and moved permanently to the\nU.S.  In 1996, Applicant returned to the U.S. where he continued his studies for two additional\nsemesters. In July 1997, he was hired by his current employer. \nIn June 1993, Applicant obtained a Taiwanese passport that expired in June 1999. (Gov Ex\n3) Applicant had no intention of renewing his Taiwanese passport when it expired. (Tr. 60) In\nFebruary 1998, Applicant stated he was willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. (Gov Ex 5)\nIn March 2002, his mother died and left some open bank retirement accounts in Taiwan that needed\nto be closed.  Four days after his mother\u2019s death, Applicant renewed his expired Taiwanese passport.\nApplicant accompanied his 74-year-old, severely hearing-impaired father who suffers from\nParkinson\u2019s disease to Taiwan to resolve the financial issues related to his mother\u2019s death.  He was\nin Taiwan from April 14, 2002 through April 21, 2002. Following his return from Taiwan, Applicant\nnever intended to use his Taiwanese passport again. (Tr. 37) In January 2007, the passport was\ndestroyed by the company\u2019s security officer. (Gov Ex 2) \nIn his November 1997 sworn statement (Gov Ex 4) and in his February 1998 sworn\nstatement (Gov Ex 5), Applicant fully explained his 1995 employment at the Taiwanese university.\nThe sworn statements explain in detail Applicant\u2019s connection with Taiwan, his education, jobs,\nbecoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, his relatives and where they lived, foreign travel, and his\n\n4\nmandatory service in the Taiwanese military.  In September 2004, Applicant completed a security\nclearance application, Standard Form (SF) 86. The SF 86 was completed by a person asking\nApplicant questions and the other individual would type out the answers.  After the document was\ncompleted, Applicant was giving the opportunity to review the document. (Tr. 38) Applicant does\nnot know the name of the interviewer nor does he know if the person was a company employee or\na government employee. (Tr. 52) Department Counsel suggest the interview actually took place in\n2005, a year after Applicant completed the SF 86. (Tr51)\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 13, which asked if he had ever been employed by a\nforeign government, firm, or agency. He answered \u201cno\u201d because his 1995 employment with the\nTaiwanese university was with a private university and did not involve government employment,\nemployment by a foreign firm, or foreign agency. \nEven though Applicant had fully disclosed his Taiwanese passport in his November 1997\nsworn statement (Gov Ex 4) and in his February 1998 sworn statement (Gov Ex 5), his SF 86\ncontains a \u201cno\u201d answer to question 15, which asked if he had a foreign passport. Applicant said this\nwas an oversight.  His answer was \u201cno\u201d to question 16, which asked if he had traveled outside the\nU.S. during the previous seven years.  He failed to disclose his one week trip to Taiwan in April\n2002. Applicant stated he believed the trip to Taiwan was disclosed elsewhere on his SF 86.\nApplicant says it was a mistake not catching the wrong answers to questions 15 and 16. (Tr. 39)\nApplicant takes responsibility for failing to catch the mistakes on his SF 86. Applicant stated he\nthought he had disclosed this Taiwanese passport during an interview, which took place at his on-\nsite work location in September 2004. During that interview, Applicant states he offered to surrender\nhis passport, showed it to the investigator, and indicated the entry and departure date stamps for his\ntrip to Taiwan in April 2002. (Tr. 40, 70) Applicant does not know the interviewer\u2019s identity or if\nhe was a company or government employee.\nApplicant intends to live permanently in the U.S.  He has no close relatives living outside\nof the U.S. He stated he was willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. (Gov Ex 5, Tr. 61)\nApplicant considers himself a loyal U.S. citizen. (Gov Exs 4 and 5) Applicant appreciates everything\nthat the U.S. offers him. (Tr. 67) \nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline C, foreign preference and\nGuideline E, personal conduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n3\n5\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.3\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under foreign preference. The\nconcern arises when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that\nare harmful to the interests of the United States.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying include: 10(a) \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\u201d\nThis includes but is not limited to: (1) possession and/or use of a foreign passport and (7) voting in\na foreign election. \nIn 1995, Applicant obtained a job with a Taiwanese university.  Having a job in a foreign\ncountry in and of itself without more is not a condition that raises concern under foreign preference.\nIt is the identity of the employer that may give rise to a security concern if that employer is a foreign\ngovernment, agency, or firm. While so employed he obtained grants from the Taiwan National\nScience Council, but part of the duties of any university professor or associate professor is to seek\ngrants so graduate students can be employed, equipment purchased, and research conducted.  While\nin Taiwan, he did vote in a 1995 election, which is a condition that could raise a security concern.\nHowever, the voting occurred 12 years ago when Applicant was living in Taiwan, has not been\nrepeated, and is unlikely to be repeated.\n\n6\nApplicant had a Taiwanese passport which he let expire in June 1999.  It is likely the\npassport would not have been renewed but for his mother\u2019s death in March 2002.  When his mother\ndied she had financial matters to be attended to in Taiwan.  Applicant accompanied his 76-year-old,\nhearing-impaired father to Taiwan.  Applicant was in Taiwan one week.  This was the only trip for\nwhich the renewed passport was used.  The passport has since been destroyed by the company\u2019s\nsecurity officer. Mitigating Condition (MC) 11(e) \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to\nthe cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d applies. He has expressed a willingness\nto renounce his Taiwanese citizenship.  MC 1(b) \u201cindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship,\u201d applies. \nThe security concern with personal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying include 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n The Government has shown Applicant's answer to questions 15 and 16, which asked about\nhis foreign passport and foreign travel, were incorrect.  Applicant takes responsibility for failing to\ncatch the mistakes on his SF 86. In November 1997, Applicant made a detailed statement discussing\neverything of relevance regarding his background in Taiwan.  He discussed his foreign passport,\nforeign travel, his relatives, his education, and work at Taiwanese university in 1995. In February\n1998, Applicant again gave a detailed sworn statement about his education, growing up in Taiwan,\nhis employment as a visiting associate professor at the Taiwanese university, his travel to Hong\nKong during the Chinese New Year, and his relatives. Having made such detailed sworn statements,\nit fails to follow that he would deliberately fail to disclose information about his foreign passport\nand foreign travel when he completed his September 2004 SF 86.\nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document\nor oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance is a security concern.\nBut every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material.\nIt is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. Applicant had previously made two, formal,\nsworn statements about his foreign passport and foreign travel. Applicant has denied intentional\nfalsification. Applicant acknowledged his behavior and admitted he did not fill out the questionnaire\nproperly. After hearing Applicant\u2019s testimony, observing his demeanor, and evaluating all the\nevidence of record, I found his testimony credible on the falsification issue. Having already\ninformed the government of his previous foreign travel and possession of a Taiwanese passport, I\nfind it unlikely Applicant would have intentionally withheld this information on his SF 86. I am\nsatisfied the incorrect answers were not an intentional falsification of his SF 86. \nWhen asked in question 13 if he had ever been employed by a foreign government, firm, or\nagency he answered \u201cno\u201d because his employment was with a private foreign university which he\ndid not believe was a foreign government, firm, or agency.  There was no deliberate falsification in\nresponse to this question.\n\n7\nSecurity clearance determinations involve a careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole person concept. In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the\ncircumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s close family lives in the U.S.  He has no remaining ties with Taiwan.  He\nowns no property there nor does he have any financial accounts there. Applicant\u2019s son and wife are\nU.S. citizens.  Applicant\u2019s loyalty is with the U.S. I find for Applicant as to foreign preference. I find\nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his SF 86 and find for him as to personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 foreign preference: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 personal conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\n_____________________________\nClaude R. Heiny \nAdministrative Judge\n",

While she provided credible evidence she had paid in full three of her\ndelinquent accounts, she failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On November 16, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive (Directive),  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), promulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications\nof SORs  issued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant\nwith a copy of the Directive and the applicable Guidelines.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing\non December 19, 2006, and requested that her case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.\nThe Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 9, 2007.  The FORM\ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 11.  By letter dated May 16, 2007, a copy of the\nFORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or\nobjections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on May 21, 2007.  She filed\nadditional information within the required time period.  Department Counsel did not object to\nApplicant\u2019s submission.  On June 28, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  After a\ncareful review of  Applicant\u2019s submission of additional information, I admitted her eight-page\nsubmission to the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ex.) A.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under revised adjudicative\nGuideline F, Financial  Considerations.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.)   (Item 1.)  Applicant admitted\nfour allegations and denied four.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old and has been employed since September 2005 by a defense\ncontractor as an administrative assistant.  From 2001 to 2005, she was employed as a clerk by a\nschool board. She was married for the first time in 1989 and divorced in 1992.  Two children were\nborn of that marriage.  Applicant married again in 1997 and divorced in 2003.  One child was born\nof that marriage.  She has a fourth child, born in 1993.  Applicant receives $469 each month in child\nsupport.  She married for the third time in 2006, and she reported her husband was helping her with\nher financial situation.  (Item 5, Item 6 at 1, 3-4.)\nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies.   The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s monthly\n3\nexpenses and debt payments exceed her income, resulting in a negative cash flow of $159 (\u00b61.a.).  The\n\n3\nSOR also alleges she is responsible for financial delinquencies totaling approximately $10, 244  (\u00b6\n\u00b6 1.b. through 1.h.)  (Item 1.)\nOne of Applicant\u2019s financial obligations arises from the repossession of a vehicle, which\nresulted in a debt, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. of approximately $7,623.  Applicant and her second husband\npurchased the vehicle in 1999, but she asserts she should not be held responsible for the debt, since\nher second husband was the primary debtor on the loan and she was the secondary debtor.  She\nprovided no credible evidence that she was not responsible for the debt.  She stated, however, that she\nwould pay the debt if failure to do so would result in the denial of her security clearance.  (Items 4,\n7, 9, 10, 11.)  \nIn an August 2006 financial statement, Applicant reported her net monthly salary as\napproximately $1,862.   She reported her husband\u2019s net monthly income as $1,800, and she reported\nreceiving $469 each month in child support. She listed $1,970 in total monthly expenses, $2,320 in\ndebt payments, and a negative net remainder of $159.  (Item 6 at 4. )\nIn mitigation, Applicant attributed her financial delinquencies to her second husband\u2019s\nabandonment of her and her four children.  (Item 4 at 1.)  In a submission of November 2006,\nApplicant provided credible evidence that she owed the debt of $377 alleged at \u00b6 1.c. and had\nsatisfied that debt. (Item 4; Item 7 at 7.)  She also provided credible evidence to show that the SOR\nallegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and 1.h. were redundant and the single debt alleged therein was satisfied. (Items\n7, 11.)  While Applicant asserted the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. was also redundant, there was\ninsufficient credible evidence in the record to establish this, and the debt was listed as a separate\naccount and unpaid on her May 2007 credit report. (Item 11.)\nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant annotated Item 11 to show she had satisfied some\nof the debts alleged at 1.d. and was continuing to pay on others.  She provided a receipt dated April\n2007 showing final payment on the debt alleged at SOR 1.e.  She stated her financial statement of\nAugust 2006  would not have reflected a negative balance if she had correctly listed car expenses of\n$250 and $300 instead of listing a redundant car payment of $595. (Ex. A.)  \nApplicant states she has had \u201cinformal credit counseling,\u201d but cannot document receiving\nformal credit counseling. (Ex. A.)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\n\n4\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. \nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (AG), promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as\nmodified. The revised AG replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive 5220.6\nand Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R and apply to all adjudications and other determinations in which\na SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case was issued\nNovember 16, 2006, the revised AG apply. \nThe revised AG set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of\nan applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination\nas to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established\nfor issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2013Financial Considerations\nAn applicant\u2019s failure to live within his or her means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  See Guideline F, \u00b6 18.\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was responsible for seven unsatisfied delinquent debts\ntotaling approximately $10,244.  The allegations raised security concerns under two Guideline F\n\n Guideline F, \u00b6 19(a) reads: \u201cInability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d Guideline F, \u00b6 19(c) reads: \u201cA history\n4\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n5\ndisqualifying conditions, \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   Applicant admitted responsibility for debts totaling\n4\napproximately $ 2,354 and stated she did not feel responsible for the debt of $7,623.  Applicant\nprovided credible evidence to show payment of the debt alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.c.  She provided credible\nevidence that the debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and 1.h. were redundant and that the single debt alleged had\nbeen paid.  She also provided credible evidence that she had paid the debt alleged at \u00b61.e. and that her\ncalculation of a negative cash flow for August 30, 2006, as alleged at \u00b6 1.a., was the result of a\nreporting error.\nThrough Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence, the Government established that\nApplicant had a history of not meeting her financial obligations and was unable or unwilling to satisfy\nher debts as specified in Guideline F, \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \nSeveral conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s remaining\nfinancial delinquencies.  Unresolved financial delinquency might be resolved if it happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.   (Guideline F,\n\u00b6 20(a))  Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation,\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  (Guideline F,\u00b6 20(b))  Still other\nmitigating circumstances that might be applicable include evidence the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d)).\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies are numerous, long-standing, and continue\nto the present day.  Several of her financial delinquencies remain unresolved, suggesting an\nunwillingness or inability to satisfy debts that is likely to recur.  Accordingly, \u00b6 20(a) does not apply\nas a mitigating condition.  Applicant attributes her financial delinquencies to her second divorce,\nwhich occurred in 2003.  While Applicant received monthly child support of $469, her status as a\nsingle parent, responsible for four children, caused financial hardship.  However, her security\nclearance application reflects she has been steadily employed since 2001.  Thus, the facts do not of\nthemselves establish that Applicant\u2019s unresolved financial delinquencies were largely beyond her\ncontrol or that she acted reasonably under the circumstances.  Nothing in the record suggests\nApplicant contacted her creditors or otherwise gave them notice of her reduced financial\ncircumstances resulting from her second divorce.  Nothing in the record suggests Applicant offered\nher creditors a plan to meet her obligations responsibly while in reduced circumstances.  Accordingly,\nI conclude \u00b6 20(b) applies only in part under the facts of this case.\nApplicant asserted she  received \u201cinformal financial counseling,\u201d but did not further specify\nwhat she meant.  She denied receiving financial counseling that she could document and define.\nApplicant worked on her own, especially after receiving the SOR, to satisfy her creditors and should\nbe commended for her efforts to resolve her debts.  However, she has not established a track record\nof timely payment of her financial obligations, and it is unclear whether her underlying financial\n\n6\nproblems are resolved or under control.  Accordingly, I conclude that \u00b6 20(c) is inapplicable.  \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies were assigned for collection in 2000, 2001, and 2002.\nShe did not address many of her delinquencies until after receiving the SOR, and this leads to a\nconcern that she initiated her efforts to pay her creditors because of her concerns about her security\nclearance and not because of her awareness of her obligation to pay her honest debts.  Applicant has\na history of financial problems.  Her recent actions to resolve some of her debts and not to address\nher largest debt, which resulted from the vehicle repossession, unless it would affect her security\nclearance, leads me to conclude Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant the application of \u00b6 20(d).   See\nISCR Case No. 01-21030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 7, 2004).\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe revised AG and the Directive require that the adjudicative process in a security clearance\ncase not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered\nin a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has a history of financial over-extension.\nHer history of not\nmeeting her financial obligations and her inability to pay her debts over a period of several years\nraises a security concern because it suggests a lack of good faith.  Since she has not sought consumer\ncredit counseling or assistance in learning how to manage her finances, Applicant has failed to\ndemonstrate her delinquencies will not continue to pose security concerns in the future. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her\nacts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude\nApplicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have\nconsidered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department\nof Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended.  I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security\nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n7\nParagraph 1.: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. : \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b. :\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c. :\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 31,\n2003 (Government Exhibit 1).  On April 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 24, 2006, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 12, 2007.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on August\n22, 2007.  I received the case assignment on August 27, 2007.  DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on September 6, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nSeptember 25, 2007. The government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which\nJanuary 10, 2008\n\n2\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on October 3, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nOctober 9, 2007, to submit additional matters.  On October 9, 2007, she submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D, without objection. The record closed on October 9, 2007. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 49, married and has a high school diploma.  She is employed by\na defense contractor as a janitor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously\ngranted in connection with her employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nBeginning in 1997, and through 2000, the Applicant began to have serious\nproblems paying her Federal income taxes in a timely manner.  The primary reason for\nthis difficulty was because the Applicant and her husband were financially over-\nextended because of the house they owned.  Because of these problems, the Internal\nRevenue Service filed various levies and tax liens against the Applicant and her\nhusband.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 3, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  By 2003, the Applicant\nowed approximately $15,187.00 in taxes, interest and penalties.  (Government Exhibit\n5.)\nThe Applicant began paying off her back taxes in 2003.  (Transcript at 32-39,\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  While she was able to reduce her indebtedness somewhat, she\nwas not able to get firmly ahead with the IRS.  In May 2007, the Applicant withdrew\n$2,000.00 from her 401(k) retirement account to pay down part of her back taxes.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5.)\nAfter making this payment, the Applicant was still indebted to the IRS in the\namount of approximately $8,635.29.  In early September 2007, the Applicant\u2019s daughter\nfound out about her parents\u2019 indebtedness to the IRS.  This daughter insisted that the\nFederal tax debt be paid in full, by having the debt put on her credit card.  (Transcript at\n42-44, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  The Applicant submitted documentation from the IRS\nshowing that they received the payment, applied it to pay the Applicant\u2019s back taxes in\nfull, and that the tax lien for tax years 1997 through 2000 has been released.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s most recent credit bureau report, dated June 22, 2007, reveals\nno past due debt by the Applicant.  Her primary debt is for her house.  (Government\nExhibit 6.)\n\n3\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant was unable to pay her tax debts for several years,\nresulting in the filing of a Federal tax lien. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 1999 and 2003. There is no evidence that she\nhas been unable to pay her taxes in a timely manner since then.  I find the behavior\noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not\nraise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The\nevidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ The Applicant never denied she owed these tax debts.  To the\nbest of her ability over several years she attempted to pay them off.  Unfortunately, her\nfinancial situation did not allow her to pay them off at once.  The debt has now been\npaid in full by the Applicant\u2019s daughter.  Therefore, the tax debt has been successfully\nresolved.  I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant, by her own\nadmission, chose making house payments ahead of making tax payments before 2003.\nSince then, it appears that her taxes have been paid in a timely fashion and she is\ncurrent on her house payments.  Of course, the issue is not simply whether all the\nApplicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout her fitness to hold a security clearance.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), this conduct is not\nrecent.  While it would have been better if she had paid her tax debt earlier, she has\npaid it off now.  The Applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s action to pay off the tax debt in full makes\nthe future debt situation regarding the Applicant easier.  Under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, this complete payment indicates that there is little to no\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)8)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that: (a) Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstance beyond her control\u2014a period of unemployment; (b)\nshe had paid off, been making payments on, or been otherwise disputing her outstanding debts; and\n(c) her job performance had been excellent and she had never mishandled sensitive information.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security\nimplications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\nsecurity concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's\nsecurity eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace.  See ISCR Case No.\n03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had significant delinquent debts and\nwas still in the process of resolving her financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\n\n3\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Despite her recent payments, she has failed to mitigate the security concerns\n\n2\nraised under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is\ndenied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated February 12, 2007) at 1-3.\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated October 5, 2004) at 1-14.\n4\nId.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 20, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn February 12, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on March 1, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n(FORM) on April 22, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material\nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.   Applicant did not submit additional\n2\ninformation. The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations in her SOR response under Guideline F except 1.c and 1.\nf.  The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in\n3\nthe record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduation from high\nschool, she attended college. She has worked for her current employer since 2004. She is divorced\nwith one adult child.  On October 5, 2004, she completed her security clearance (SF 86) application.\n4\n5\nApplicant was steadily employed after college (1986), except for a brief period of two months\nin 2000 and nine months in 2002-2003. She held a managerial position for 12 years and received\nnumerous promotions. After working several years, she returned to complete a graduate degree in\n2003. She worked as a graduate assistant until graduation in 2004. Since 2004, she has been\nemployed by the defense contractor earning a good salary. She had a net monthly remainder of $529\nin October 2005.  \n\nItem 3, supra note 3, at 1-2.\n6\nThe student loans are not at issue and are in deferment status.\n7\nItem 6 (Credit Bureau Report, dated March 6, 2007) at 1-3.\n8\nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s response to Interrogatories and attachments) dated January 2, 2007.\n9\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n10\n4\nApplicant\u2019s debts in the SOR total approximately $39,000. Two debts in the SOR are in\ndispute.   She affirmed that her delinquent debt started in 2002 when she was unemployed and then\n6\ndecided to stop working and attend graduate school. She acquired student loan debt at that time.7\nMultiple accounts were charged off or placed for collection. Several of the debts have been in\ncollection since 2003.  \n8\nApplicant does not deny that she is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax\nyears 1999 and 2001. However, she claims she has been paying $100 per month since March 2005\nand that her federal tax refunds are applied to the debt. She asserts the amount owed is approximately\n$5,000. Applicant submitted a monthly statement dated August 28, 2006 from the IRS indicating that\nher last monthly payment of $100 was received. \nApplicant denies that she is indebted to a collection account for a vehicle that was\nrepossessed in 2003. In her 2005 affidavit she stated she has no intention of paying this $16,049 debt\nbecause the credit company never contacted her after she told them she could not pay for the car. The\ndebt was verified by the company and is still on her recent credit report.\nApplicant disputed a debt charged off in the amount of $338 because she stated it has been\npaid in full since January 2006. This account still appears on her recent credit report.\nAfter her security clearance investigation, Applicant began to make monthly payments on\nthe debts alleged in the SOR (1.a, 1.b, and 1.d). She provided some documentation to substantiate\nthis. However, some of the accounts are still listed on her 2006 credit report.\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is $2,512.58. After expenses, her monthly net remainder is\n$638.58 as of August 2006.9\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n10\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n11\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n12\n Id.\n13\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n17\n5\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n11\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n12\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n13\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.14\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n15\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n16\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n17\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n18\n6\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.18\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $39,000. She admits they are still outstanding debts. Her\n2006 credit report confirms debt that she had on her 2004 credit report. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and FC DC AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nApplicant still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. One collection account is from 2001.\nDespite steady employment, she has not made payments on these debts until recently. \nApplicant was unemployed for two months in 2000 and nine months from May 2002 until\n2003. Other than those 2 periods, she has been steadily employed since 1986, receiving numerous\npromotions. She has been in her current position since 2004 with a monthly net remainder. In light of\nthe relatively short period of unemployment during Applicant\u2019s working career, and several years of\nearning a substantial salary, she has not provided evidence or explanation to support the FC MC AG\n\u00b620 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nApplicant incurred some debts in 2003-2004 when she was in graduate school. However, she\nwas not unemployed for that entire time. She worked as a Graduate Assistant for more than 1.5 years.\nShe was earning a salary and could have made some effort to deal with her mounting debts.\nApplicant\u2019s decision to return to school and take on significant additional debt in the form of student\nloans, does not absolve her from acting responsibly in paying her debts.\nFC MC AG \u00b620 (c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/\nor there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply. She\nhas not received financial counseling or developed a structured plan to resolve these debts. Applicant's\nfinancial problems remain. It is unlikely they will be resolved in the near future.\n\n7\nFC MC AG \u00b620(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that she established a record of\nsteady payments or financial stability. She ignored her federal tax liability for the years 1999 and 2001\nuntil recently. Prior to her security investigation, she had not paid her debts on a regular basis. Thus,\nI conclude that she did not make a good-faith effort to resolve her debts.\nFC MC AG \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis\nof the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply because Applicant\ndisputed but then ignored the vehicle repossession debt. This is a confirmed debt on her 2006 credit\nreport.\nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her\noutstanding debts, but whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigatiion or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination. Her remaining unpaid debt\nconstitutes a security concern.  She has been employed with her current employer since 2004. She has\na net monthly remainder that could be used to pay toward the delinquent debt. However, she has\nchosen not to do that until recently. This raises doubt about her ability to resolve her outstanding debt.\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Even an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage\nin conduct that has negative implications or presents doubt about her judgment. Despite steady\nemployment, Applicant has accrued multiple delinquent accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 19, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant\nfiled an undated Answer that was received by DOHA on February 23, 2007, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 26, 2007.\nWith the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on May 9, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Six Government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) and 19 Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-S) were admitted\nand testimony was taken from Applicant, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on May 21, 2007.\nThe record was held open after the hearing until June 1, 2007, for Applicant to submit\nadditional financial records as well as a character reference. By facsimile on May 23, 2007,\nApplicant timely forwarded five proposed exhibits that were marked and entered as Exhibits T\nthrough X, Department Counsel having no objections.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owed a $4,844 judgment since March 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $5,160 delinquent credit card debt in collection (\u00b6 1.b), a $4,052 credit card debt\ncharged off in January 1999 (\u00b6 1.c), a $1,149 revolving charge debt (\u00b6 1.d), a $1,940 retail charge\ndebt in collection (\u00b6 1.e), and a $179 gas services debt in collection (\u00b6 1.f). Applicant was alleged\nunder Guideline J to have been convicted and sentenced to a $100 fine for conspiracy to violate\ncontrolled substances laws in January 2001 (\u00b6 2.a), and to have served pretrial probation for a July\n2005 assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (\u00b6 2.b).\nApplicant admitted the debts as alleged, but indicated that she had contacted an attorney to\npursue a bankruptcy and had not had an active credit card in more than five years. Applicant also\nadmitted the criminal charges and sentences as alleged, but in a handwritten explanation essentially\ndenied any culpability of the drug charge. As for the assault, Applicant indicated she was tired of\nsupporting her spouse. She \u201clost it\u201d in July 2005 and hit her spouse with a plastic snow shovel, but\nthey separated in September 2005.\n\nApplicant testified that he left her for another woman so she filed for divorce. (Tr. 29)\n1\nThe disposition of the offense, a $100 fine, suggests recognition by the court that Applicant\u2019s involvement was\n2\nminor.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the indebtedness and to the criminal charges and sentences are\nincorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, I make the following additional findings:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old paste machine operator who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since October 1981. She has held a confidential security clearance since she was 19. She\nseeks to retain that clearance.\nApplicant married her first husband in 1983. A daughter was born to them in June 1985, and\na son in June 1986. Applicant worked on second shift, her husband on first shift. In November 1994,\nthey got divorced,  and Applicant married her current husband in February 1995.  She met him at\n1\nwork after she was legally separated from her first spouse but before her divorce. There were\nproblems in this marriage from the start. About one month into the marriage, he quit his job. In early\nApril 1995, Applicant obtained a temporary restraining order against her current husband after he\nstruck her in the face during an argument. The abuse continued throughout their marriage, but\nApplicant did not file charges against him.\nApplicant was not able to count on her current spouse holding a steady job or on her first\nhusband paying child support. By May 2001, her first spouse had accumulated child support\narrearage totaling $19,402.50. She gave up on her efforts to force him to pay as it cost her legal fees\nevery time she brought her ex-husband into court.\nApplicant\u2019s income was not enough to support her family, and she incurred credit card debt\nbeyond her ability to timely repay. Her revolving charge card with a department store, opened since\nJanuary 1984, had been charged off in the amount of $2,336 by March 2003 (\u00b6 1.e). A VISA card\naccount opened by Applicant in October 1996 was charged off in the amount of $4,052 with no\nactivity since May 1998 (\u00b6 1.c). A revolving charge account opened in October 1997 was charged\noff in the amount of $1,149 with last activity in May 1998 (\u00b6 1.d). A $28 cable television debt was\nplaced for collection in August 2001 (not alleged).\nIn addition to a history of unstable employment (\u201cThis man never kept a job, he would work,\nhe would quit, he would get fired.\u201d Tr. 38), Applicant\u2019s current spouse had a substance abuse\nproblem. On January 9, 2001, Applicant was out with her spouse when he waved down a friend. As\nthey approached, they were surrounded by the police who had the other person under surveillance,\nand were arrested for conspiracy to violate the drug laws (attempting to purchase cocaine). Applicant\npaid a $100 fine to dispose of the charge.  She denies that she intended to purchase drugs or that she\n2\nor her husband had any drugs on him. She did not approve of his substance abuse.\nApplicant, who had been living with her two children and her second husband in her\nmother\u2019s home at a monthly rental of $650 to $700, was forced to move in about June 2001, when\nher mother and stepfather returned to the area from a distant state. Her two children remained with\ntheir grandmother so that they could finish school in their district. Her husband was then\n\nApplicant testified the debt was a consumer credit card debt but she cannot which credit card.  (Tr. 73)\n3\n4\nunemployed, so Applicant resorted to taking a cash advance of $1,500 to $2,000 on a DISCOVER\ncard account jointly held with her spouse to cover the cost of an apartment rental (first and last\nmonth rents and security deposit). She also purchased items for the new apartment using this credit\ncard. By June 2002, the DISCOVER card account had been charged off and sold with a balance\nowed of $5,160 (\u00b6 1.b). \nOn October 6, 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86). In\nresponse to any felony offenses (question 21), Applicant indicated she had paid a fine for a January\n2000 [sic] drug offense. Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 38 [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you ever\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d], and listed the $5,160 DISCOVER card debt (\u00b6 1.b).\nShe also responded affirmatively to question 39 [\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d] and listed the $4,052 VISA card debt (\u00b6 1.c).\nIn March 2003, a $4,844 judgment was awarded against Applicant (\u00b6 1.a).  She began\n3\nrepaying the debt at $30 per month, mostly on time. A telephone services provider charged off a\n$75.82 balance in May 2003 that was eventually placed for collection in March 2006 (not alleged).\nAs of December 2002, a $316 debt balance was in collection status (not alleged).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on February 12, 2004, disclosed the $4,844 judgment award\n(\u00b6 1.a), collection debts of $316 and $28, the DISCOVER card and VISA card debts, and two retail\nrevolving charge debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). It was also reported that Applicant had paid other debts\naccording to terms, including an automobile loan for $19,087 taken out in August 1995 and satisfied\nin May 1997.\nIn late May 2004, Applicant moved in with her grandmother as she could not afford a recent\nraise in her apartment rent from $750 to $950 per month. Her spouse was in jail for assaulting\nanother person. Applicant\u2019s grandmother did not charge her rent but Applicant bought the groceries.\nIn August 2004, she moved to her present residence. She and her husband reconciled about that time.\nShe took out a loan of between $1,700 and $2,000  from her 401(k) account at work to pay the first\nand last month rents at her new apartment. The debt is being repaid through automatic deduction\nfrom her pay.\nIn October 2004, a natural gas provider referred a $179 delinquent debt balance for collection\n(\u00b6 1.f). On May 20, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a special investigator for the Office of\nPersonnel Management Investigations Service about her financial problems. Applicant attributed her\nfinancial difficulties to her divorce in 1994 and consequent loss of her first husband\u2019s income. She\nindicated she did not recall which credit card lender had obtained the judgment against her, but she\nwas repaying it at $30 per month. She admitted she did not pay the old cable debt of $28 or the\n$75.82 long distance telephone debt. As for the DISCOVER debt, she indicated she incurred unpaid\ncharges of about $2,000 but it rose due to interest. Applicant had not made a payment nor had she\nbeen contacted by the creditor in several years. She also did not dispute the VISA card account held\njointly with her first husband or that she had not made payment on that debt. Applicant did not\n\nApplicant testified the charges may well have been incurred when she and her spouse purchased a stereo on\n4\ncredit from a retailer that has since gone out of business.  She had paid down the debt down to $300 or $400 from its\noriginal debt of $700 when her husband charged a television antenna and sleeping bag. (Tr. 79-80)\n5\nrecognize either the $316 collection debt (not alleged) or the retail debt of $1,149 (\u00b6 1.d).  Applicant\n4\nprovided a personal financial statement on which she estimated a joint net monthly remainder of\n$1,008 after payment of expenses and $30 on the judgment debt.\nAs of May 2005, Applicant\u2019s spouse was working for a temporary employment company.\nAfter he came home \u201chigh,\u201d she told him she wanted him out of the house by mid-June 2005.  He\nquit his job and had squandered his job earnings instead of leaving. Over the next couple of weeks,\nshe came home from work only to find Applicant and his sister under the influence of a mood-\naltering substance. In early July 2005,  Applicant struck her spouse with a plastic snow shovel during\nan argument (\u201cI wanted him out for so long and so bad that I snapped.\u201d Tr. 42), and he called the\npolice. She was under the influence of alcohol, having consumed seven or eight beers. Applicant was\narrested and was released on personal recognizance after spending the weekend in a holding cell.\nDuring a subsequent argument in August 2005, Applicant threw the handset and a can at her spouse.\nHe contacted the police, and she was arrested. In October 2005, she was placed on pretrial probation\nto April 20, 2006, on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. \nApplicant moved out of the marital residence in August 2005. After her spouse relocated to\na distant state in September 2005, Applicant moved back into the house. She has had no contact with\nhim since they conversed by telephone in December 2005. \nAs of August 9, 2006, Equifax reported Applicant owed four debts in collection:  the $75\ntelephone debt, $28 cable television debt, $179 gas services debt, and the $5,160 DISCOVER card\ndebt. The $4,052 VISA card debt (\u00b6 1.c), and $1,149 (\u00b6 1.d) and $1,940 (\u00b6 1.e) were not on the credit\nreport.\nDOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant inquiring about her arrest for assault and the status\nof the debts that had been reported as delinquent on her February 2004 and August 2006 credit\nreports. During the last week of August, Applicant satisfied her $28 cable television and $75\ntelephone service debts.  In her September 5, 2006, response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant\nadmitted striking her spouse in July 2005, but indicated that they had been physically separated for\nthe past 13 months. She averred she would seek a divorce if her spouse returned to her present locale.\nConcerning her indebtedness, Applicant provided an August 23, 2006, credit report that listed the\ndebt in \u00b6 1.b and the $179 gas services debt (not alleged) as unpaid. Her credit record had not yet\nbeen updated to reflect the satisfaction of the $28 cable television or $75 telephone service debts.\nApplicant completed a personal financial statement at DOHA\u2019s request, estimating a net monthly\nremainder of $85 on an hourly wage of $19.12.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 14, 2006, showed no progress in resolving the\n$5,160 DISCOVER card debt (\u00b6 1.b) or the $179 natural gas debt (\u00b6 1.f). On January 19, 2007,\nDOHA issued an SOR, alleging those debts as well as the others that had been reported as past due\nin February 2004 but did not appear in recent credit checks.\n\n6\nApplicant was on short-term disability from her employment from October 5, 2006, to\nDecember 13, 2006, and on long-term disability through March 8, 2007,  because of a herniated disc\nand treatment. Applicant had injured herself in a fall in July 2006. When she could no longer tolerate\nthe pain, she sought medical care in October 2006, initially shots for pain but later surgery. She was\npaid 100% of her salary while on short-term disability but only 50% when on long-term disability.\nApplicant incurred out-of-pocket medical expenses for her treatment. From January 9, 2007, to\nFebruary 22, 2007, Applicant paid $350 in physical therapy costs. She returned to work on or about\nMarch 9, 2007, half days for the first two weeks and thereafter full-time. \nWhile out on disability, Applicant consulted with an attorney about filing for bankruptcy. She\nelected not to file as she wanted to take responsibility for her financial obligations (\u201cI even said to\nhim, I said I honestly don\u2019t even know if this is a good idea because, to me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m sweeping\nmy problems under the carpet.\u201d Tr. 57). Applicant made $50 payments on her delinquent gas bill on\nFebruary 15, 2007, and on April 3, 2007. She satisfied the debt on April 17, 2007, with a payment\nof $79.95 (\u00b6 1.f). Applicant had been paying $30 monthly on the judgment debt for the most part (\u00b6\n1.a), but was getting nowhere due to interest charges. In about April 2007, she arranged to increase\nher monthly payment to $100 with further interest being waived as long as she made the payments.\nWith a payment of $100 on April 20, 2007, she still owed $6,504.12 due to interest. Applicant\nentered into an agreement with the assignee to pay $50 per month on the DISCOVER card debt (\u00b6\n1.b) starting in May 2007.\nAs of May 2007, Applicant had not contacted her other creditors (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e). She was\nliving from paycheck to paycheck on an hourly wage of $19.69, and without certainty as to her job\nstatus, did not feel she could promise to pay that she might not be able to keep. Applicant had\ncontacted two debt consolidation firms for assistance but could not afford the $670 to $690 per\nmonth to pay off her debts. If she is able to retain her present job, she plans to get a second job to\ngive her extra funds to repay her obligations. Applicant does not have a savings account or any active\ncredit card accounts. She took her spouse off of her medical insurance, which freed up about $19.69\nper week.\nFrom September 2005 through August 2006, Applicant was an operator in the conformal coat\narea. Her supervisor found her to be an excellent employee. Transferred to a new area in September\n2006, she exhibited  willingness to learn and a good attitude. Her current supervisor considers her\nto be a welcome addition to the team.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. Applicant has had financial problems since she\ndivorced her first husband in 1994. Consumer credit card debt totaling $12,697 was charged off\nand/or placed for collection in or before March 2003 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e). One creditor obtained a\njudgment of $4,844.58 against Applicant in March 2003 (\u00b6 1.a). Applicant was unable to recall, or\nto produce documentation identifying the original creditor, although she testified it was a credit card\ndebt.  While she apparently overlooked a minor cable television debt of $28 when she moved, she\n5\nfell behind in her gas bill and $179 was sent for collection in October 2004 (\u00b6 1.f). A telephone debt\nof $75, due since May 2003, was placed for collection in March 2006 (not alleged). Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to meet her financial obligations is recent and raises significant security concerns. Under\nGuideline F, disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b619(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b6\n19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started after her divorce, when her first husband failed to pay\nchild support of almost $20,000. She was forced to rely on consumer credit to purchase clothing and\nother items for her children. Her ex-husband\u2019s failure to support their children is a circumstance\nwithin mitigating condition (MC )\u00b6 20(b), the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances). However, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are also due in part to her poor\njudgment. Over the October 1996 to May 1998 time frame, she ran up about $4,052 in credit card\ndebt on a VISA card. Knowing that she had to repay that substantial debt, she and her husband\nopened a joint credit card account in October 1997, on which they incurred $1,149 in debt. About\n$700 was likely for a stereo that they wanted. Whether or not her husband charged other items on\n\nThere is no indication that the creditors in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, or 1.e are actively pursuing collection at this time.\n6\n8\nthe card without her knowledge, MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply where the expenditure was discretionary\nand incurred when she was already heavily in debt.\nIn her favor, however, Applicant\u2019s over reliance on consumer credit has not persisted. The\navailable credit reports confirm most of the delinquent charges were incurred more than five years\nago. The $5,160 DISCOVER card debt was primarily a cash advance needed for rent when she had\nto move out of her mother\u2019s home in June 2001. She showed good financial judgment in residing\nwith her grandmother rent-free from May 2004 to August 2004. Although Applicant renewed her\ncohabitant relationship with her abusive spouse from August 2004 to August 2005 (see Guideline\nJ, supra), they did not incur any new consumer credit card debt. MC \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, applies\nas far as her abuse of credit is concerned. \nAfter the SOR was issued, Applicant very recently satisfied three minor collection debts (a\n$28 cable bill and a $75 telephone debt that were not alleged, and the $179 gas debt in \u00b6 1.f). These\nare considered good faith efforts, albeit belated, to repay her debts (see MC \u00b6 20(d) the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). While she\nreported a net monthly remainder of $1,008 as of May 2005, she was still with her husband who quit\nhis job shortly thereafter, and who had a history of substance abuse. It is not clear what he did with\nthe money while Applicant was working to support them, although Applicant testified she would\ncome home to find him and his sister high. The delay in debt satisfaction is credibly attributed to the\nloss of income due to disability and medical co-pay expenses incurred after she was again on her\nown. Applicant was paid only half of her salary when out on long-term disability from about\nDecember 16, 2006 to about March 8, 2007, and she paid at least $350 in out-of-pocket physical\ntherapy costs. For the most part, Applicant has been paying on the judgment debt in \u00b6 1.a since\nMarch 2003, although she made no headway toward reducing the debt because of interest. In April\n2007, she arranged with the lawyer collecting the debt to raise her payment to $100 monthly in\nexchange for a waiver of new interest charges. Similarly, she has taken the initial step toward\nresolving the debt in \u00b6 1.b by arranging repayment at $50 per month and making that initial payment.\nApplicant expressed a credible intent to pay the rest of her delinquent debt, which totals\nabout $18,755.40 (less $4,052 if \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are the same debt). With a net annual income of about\n$22,000 from her job with the defense contractor, Applicant had little to no savings as of May 2007,\nas she had to get caught up in her utility bills. She stopped paying for medical insurance for her\nspouse, which freed up about $19.69 per week,  but with the $150 for the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b\ncoming out of her pay,  she is not currently in a position to pay on the other debts. (See \u00b6 18, an\n6\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds). However, with the improvement in her medical condition, Applicant intends to obtain a\nsecond job to obtain the income needed to address her other obligations. Her personal situation has\nsufficiently stabilized to where she is in a better position than previously to take affirmative steps\ntoward resolving her debt if given the opportunity.\n\n9\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. AG \u00b6 30. In January 2001, Applicant was charged with conspiracy to violate the\ndrug laws. The case was disposed of by her payment of a $100 fine and $35 fee. In October 2005,\nshe was placed on six months pretrial probation for assault and battery on her spouse in July and\nAugust 2005. DC \u00b6 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and \u00b6 31(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted, apply.\nApplicant has consistently claimed that she did not intend to engage in any illegal drug\ntransaction or abuse on the occasion of her arrest in January 2001 (see MC \u00b6 32(c) evidence that the\nperson did not commit the offense).  Applicant testified that her spouse might have been trying to buy\ncocaine (Tr. 82), although she denied knowing of his intent. She intended to plead not guilty until\nadvised by the police that it could mean a lengthy trial; that if she pleaded guilty the case would be\ndisposed of with a fine. (Tr. 44-45) The imposition of only a $100 fine at her initial court appearance\n(see Ex. G) lends credence to her testimony that she pleaded guilty to avoid a trial.\nApplicant readily admitted that she struck her spouse in July 2005 with a plastic shovel and\nthen in August 2005 with a telephone handset and a can. The assaults were in the context of an\nabusive relationship where Applicant was usually the victim, but it does not excuse her recent\ncriminal conduct. Yet, she has also demonstrated reform in completing her six months of pretrial\nprobation without incident. She has accepted responsibility for her misconduct (\u201cI got in a huge\nargument, I had a few beers to drink. I got in a huge argument with the man and I did, it was the first\ntime in my life I ever went after the man, I hit him with the plastic snow shovel.\u201d Tr. 40). She has\nexpressed remorse (\u201cI\u2019m not proud of myself,\u201d Tr. 38) and given that Applicant and her spouse have\nbeen living apart since August 2005, it is not likely to recur. Favorable consideration of  MC \u00b6 32(d)\nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement, is appropriate.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nApplicant\u2019s longstanding financial problems and recent criminal conduct warranted the\nGovernment\u2019s scrutiny over whether she should retain the confidential clearance that she has held\nfor the past 25 years (see \u00b6 2(a)(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, \u00b6 2(a)(3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct). However, her financial difficulties are attributable in large\npart to her former and current spouses\u2019 failures to live up to their financial responsibilities. Recent\nfinancial struggles are attributed to unexpected medical costs and loss of income while on disability\n(see \u00b6 2(a)(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct). While she owes sizable delinquent debt\nin relation to her income, Applicant has shown that she can manage her finances responsibly since\nshe has been living on her own (\u00b6 2(a)(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes). Her criminal assault was not due to violent tendencies on her part,\nbut rather to her frustration with a physically abusive spouse who preferred a life of leisure and\n\n10\nillegal drug use to one of productive employment and marital support. Recurrence of the criminal\nconduct is not likely since they are physically separated and Applicant intends to file for divorce if\nhe returns (see \u00b6 2(a)(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence). With the favorable change in\nher personal situation, Applicant is less at risk than she was when she was struggling to support her\ntwo children and a spouse who cared not to live up to his marital obligations. Having not allowed\nher  financial or personal relationship problems to negatively effect her employment and security\nresponsibilities in the past, she is not likely to succumb to any pressures now. Applicant has plans\nin place to resolve the indebtedness that she understands she has an ethical duty to repay.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (eQIP)1 on August 3, \n2005. On August 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).2  \n \n1  Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing. \n \n2  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nFebruary 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 4, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on November 28, 2007. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 5, 2007, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 9, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were received without objection. GE 3 was not admitted, but considered for \nadministrative notice purposes only.3 Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 17, \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 4, 2007, Applicant admitted all SOR \nallegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old consultant for a federal contractor. He has never been \nmarried and has no children. His paternal and maternal grandparents and his parents \nwere born and raised in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan). His paternal \ngrandparents immigrated to the United States around 1983 (Tr. 84). His grandfather had \nan import and export business in Afghanistan. His grandmother was a homemaker. \nBoth of them passed away in the United States and are buried in a multi-family \ncemetery plot in the United States (Tr. 32). Applicant, his parents, brother, and other \nrelatives have space reserved for them in the family cemetery plot, and have expressed \ntheir desire to be buried in the United States. His maternal grandfather died in \nAfghanistan, and his maternal grandmother immigrated to the United States around \n1988. She has been a homemaker all her life.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is 60 years old and his mother is 45 years old. From 1978 to \n1987, his father held a supervisory position in an important agency of the government of \nAfghanistan (Tr. 85). Around 1987, the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan. Afraid of \nthe new regime, his parents immigrated first to India for a short period of time, and then \nto France where they lived from 1988 to 1992. In 1992, they immigrated and settled in \nthe United States. Applicant\u2019s father was unemployed from 1992 to 2000. Around 2000, \nhis father began working as a language consultant and taught French and Farsi Dari \n(Afghanistan\u2019s Persian dialect). Applicant\u2019s parents became naturalized U.S. citizens in \nDecember 2000. Applicant and his brother were minors and acquired U.S. citizenship at \n \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n3  Department Counsel\u2019s November 19, 2007 motion asked that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts concerning the government of Afghanistan (Tr. 92-93). The request and the attached \ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were considered and included in the record as GE 3 for \nIdentification. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe same time. His parents and brother are dual citizens of Afghanistan and the United \nStates. \n \nAfter September 11, 2001, Applicant\u2019s father was contacted by old friends and \nco-workers within the government of Afghanistan and he began working for the Afghani \ngovernment against the Taliban (Tr. 89). Since 2003, Applicant\u2019s father has been \nworking in an important position for the government of Afghanistan. Applicant testified \nhis parents own no property outside of the United States. He claimed all of their \ninvestments and property is located in the United States (Tr. 32). Their permanent \nresidence is in the United States; however, they currently live in a European country \ndue to his father\u2019s job. Applicant\u2019s father travels at least once a year to Afghanistan and \nhas frequent contact with important people within the Afghani government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was educated in France where he received a juris doctor and a \ndoctorate degree (Tr. 33). Applicant testified his father\u2019s job is dangerous and he is \nplacing his life at risk by working for the Afghani government. He does it because he \nfeels obligated to help fight terror and the Taliban. He believes his father would never \ncompromise the United States because he considers himself a U.S. citizen, has stated \nhis intention to resign his job for the government of Afghanistan if he is asked to \nrenounce his U.S. citizenship, and he plans to retire in the United States. Applicant \nfurther believes his father would never compromise his position.  \n \nApplicant immigrated with his parents to the United States at age nine. \nThereafter, he was raised and educated in the United States. Although Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen when his parents were naturalized, he formally \napplied for his U.S. citizenship as soon as be became of legal age (Tr. 90). In May \n2005, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and economics. He was \nhired by a federal contractor in August 2005, and had interim access to classified \ninformation until August 2006 (Tr. 7-8). He enrolled in law school during the fall of 2007, \nand is currently working part-time for another defense contractor (Tr. 6).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother is a dual citizen of the United States and \nAfghanistan. He lived with his parents in Europe from 2003 until the fall of 2007 when \nhe started college in the United States. He has possession of both countries\u2019 passports \n(Tr. 63-64).  \n \nApplicant has a large extended family \u2013 his father has eight siblings and his \nmother has 12 siblings, all of whom were born and raised in Afghanistan (Tr. 65-76). \nHowever, Applicant testified he no longer has relatives living in Afghanistan. All of his \nrelatives immigrated either to France or the United States. Applicant has three uncles \nand one aunt whom have been living in France for approximately 20 years. Two of his \nuncles became naturalized French citizens, and relinquished their Afghani citizenship in \nthe process. One is a U.S. citizen living in France. His relatives living in France were \neducated there, and have families and own businesses in France. The rest of \nApplicant\u2019s relatives are residents of the United States. It is not clear whether all of his \nparent\u2019s siblings living in the United States are naturalized U.S. citizens; however, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant believes most of them are citizens or are in the process of applying for U.S. \ncitizenship. Applicant has frequent contact with his relatives in the United States. \n \nApplicant maintains casual contact with his relatives in France and visits them \napproximately once a year. He visits relatives in France when he visits his parents in \nEurope, and during special occasions such as his cousin\u2019s wedding in 2005. Applicant \nclaimed he does not contact his relatives in France telephonically or by letter. Most of \nhis contacts with them are through Internet social networking websites (Tr. 67). One of \nApplicant\u2019s uncles living in France owns real estate property in the United States. \nApplicant manages his uncle\u2019s real estate property in the United States. He and his \nuncle opened a joint U.S. bank account to facilitate his managing his  uncle\u2019s property \n(GE 2).  \n \nApplicant has very strong ties of affection and obligation towards his parents (Tr. \n49). He and his brother visit them two to three times a year, usually during the \nChristmas and summer holidays. Applicant and his mother opened a joint account in the \nUnited States. She deposits money in the account so that Applicant can pay for his and \nhis brother\u2019s education, living expenses, and for him to manage his parent\u2019s home (GE \n2). \n \nDuring May-July 2005, Applicant traveled with his father to Afghanistan and \nstayed there for two weeks. His father wanted Applicant to see first hand the living \nconditions in Afghanistan, and to impress on him how nice it is to live in the United \nStates (Tr. 79). For security reasons, whenever Applicant\u2019s father travels to Afghanistan \nhe travels anonymously, without official escort or protocol (Tr. 81). After visiting other \ncountries, Applicant believes the United States offers the best opportunities for a first \ngeneration immigrant. He considers the United States the best place in the world to live \n(Tr. 37). \n \nApplicant believes his relationship with his parents should not raise a concern for \nseveral reasons; Afghanistan and the United States have similar interests and are \nfighting the war on terror and drugs; his father believes in democracy, free markets, and \ncivil liberties (Tr. 61); his father is doing all he can to help the people of Afghanistan fight \nterror and the war on drugs; and Afghanistan\u2019s economic and industrial situation would \nnot allow the country to use any information Applicant could acquire. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Afghanistan was controlled by \nIslamic extremists (the Taliban) from around 1990 to 2001. The Taliban committed \nserious human rights violations and atrocities against minority populations and women, \nand provided sanctuary to Osama Bin-Laden, Al-Qa\u2019ida, and other terrorist \norganizations. A new democratic government took power in 2004, assisted by the \nUnited States and an International coalition. Despite the new democratic government, \nAfghanistan\u2019s human rights record has remained poor because of the continuing \ninsurgency and the weakness of the central government. The government has not been \nable to develop and sustain the rule of law within its borders. This has allowed non-state \nactors, hostile states, terrorist organizations, and insurgents to continue to operate in \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nAfghanistan. International terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \ncapable state intelligence services. These actions endanger the international community \nand its citizens, and threaten U.S. national security. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is: \u201cforeign contacts and interests \nmay be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial \ninterests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d AG \u00b6 6. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two disqualifying conditions are particularly relevant to this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and, \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.6  \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother were born and raised in Afghanistan, and they \ncontinue to be citizens of that country. Moreover, from 1978 to 1987, Applicant\u2019s father \nworked for the government of Afghanistan in an important position. Since 2003, \nApplicant\u2019s father has been working again for the government of Afghanistan in another \nimportant position. He and his wife travel at least once a year to Afghanistan. Applicant \nhas strong ties of affection and/or obligation with his parents. He has frequent contacts \nwith and visits his parents at least twice a year. Applicant\u2019s strong ties of affection \nand/or obligation with his parents potentially create a risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because there is the possibility that Afghan terrorist groups, \ninsurgents, and hostile states working within Afghanistan may exploit the opportunity to \nobtain intelligence, classified, or economic information about the United States.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his parents also create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause his relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire \nto help his parents or the government of Afghanistan by providing sensitive or classified \ninformation.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the Government. \n \n  \nThere are six Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 that are \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions. After considering the totality of \nthe facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply. Applicant has a very close relationship of affection and/or \nobligation with his parents. From 1978 to 1987, his father worked in an important \nposition for the government of Afghanistan. In 2001, he again began working for the \ngovernment of Afghanistan. Since 2003, he has held an important position within the \nAfghani government. Applicant\u2019s parents live in Europe, but they travel to Afghanistan \nas part of his government-related job. Considering Afghanistan\u2019s government instability, \nhis father\u2019s position in the Afghani government, and the different terrorist organizations \nworking within Afghanistan, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he would not be \nplaced on a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. Mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c) do not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. Applicant has been in the United States since age \nnine and he was educated in the United States. He formally applied to become a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen as soon as he reached legal age. He has no financial, business, \nor property interests in Afghanistan. He has been to Afghanistan only once in his life, to \nlearn first-hand about how people in Afghanistan live and to understand how good are \nthe living conditions and opportunities in the United States. Most of Applicant\u2019s relatives \nlive in France or in the United States.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nNotwithstanding, Applicant has a very close relationship of affection and/or \nobligation with his parents. His father works in an important position for the government \nof Afghanistan and he may be placed in a position of having to choose between his \naffection and loyalty to his parents and his loyalty to the United States. Under the \ncircumstances of this case, Applicant\u2019s mitigating information is insufficient to convince \nme that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates\u2019 interest. \n \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, \nI considered Afghanistan\u2019s form of government.7 Afghanistan is an Islamic republic with \na recently established and weak democratic government. Its government has a poor \nrecord of protecting human rights and has been unable to provide good governance and \nto sustain the rule of law within its borders. Terrorist groups, non-state actors, and \nhostile states conduct effective intelligence activities and operate within its borders. \nTheir actions threaten the international community and its citizens and threaten the \nnational security of the United States.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence shows it is likely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nparents and the interests of the United States.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been in the United \nStates for 15 years and a naturalized U.S. citizen for around seven years. He was \neducated in the United States and his grandparents lived in the United States for \n \n \n7  The focus of the analysis is primarily on its rulers and the nature of the government they \nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level \nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States. Terrorism and crime are also factors to be \nconsidered.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \napproximately 25 years. His parents are dual citizens of the United States and \nAfghanistan. He has no relatives living in Afghanistan. His parents own property only in \nthe United States and they intend to retire in the United States. Applicant worked for two \ndefense contractors and had interim access to classified information at the secret level \nfor one year. There is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised classified \ninformation or that he has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the \nprotection of classified information. \n \nAfter carefully considering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, including his father\u2019s \nimportant position with the Afghani government, I conclude he is in a position where he \nmay be induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \nthat is not in U.S. interests, or he may be vulnerable to pressure or coercion by his \nfather, the government of Afghanistan, or one of the many terrorist organization \noperating in Afghanistan. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the concerns arising from his foreign influence security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and\n1\nmodified.\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\n2\nConsumption, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct Guidelines of the Directive.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On November 16, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guidelines F (Financial Considerations),\nG (Alcohol Consumption), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct), promulgated December\n29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs issued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter.\nWith the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the Directive and the applicable\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  On December 7, 2006, Applicant filed a signed response to the SOR.  He\nrequested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File\nof Relevant Material (FORM) on February 9, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as\nItems 1 through 7.  \nOn February 14, 2007, Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM, with instructions to\nsubmit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  He did not submit any\ninformation within the 30-day time period.  On April 12, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a\ndecision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 37 years old and employed as a material supply clerk by a Defense contractor.  He\nattended junior college from 1987 to 1988, and he  served in the U.S. Navy from 1988 to 1992.  (Item\n4.)\nApplicant is the father of three children, ages 20, 9, and 8.  He was married in 2000 and\ndivorced in 2003.  He married his second wife in 2004.  He pays approximately $525 per month in\nchild support.  He lists his total net monthly income as $2,256 and his total monthly expenses as\n$3,265. (Item 5.) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that Applicant was responsible\nfor twelve past-due debts: six financial delinquencies  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.d., 1.f., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.k.); two\npast-due medical bills  (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b., and 1.g.); a judgment on an automobile repossession ( SOR \u00b6\n\n3\n1.c.);  two wage garnishments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.l.); and a returned check (SOR \u00b61.j.).  (Item 1.)  The\nalleged financial delinquencies total approximately $17,700 and none had been satisfied as of\nNovember 3, 2006.  (FORM at 3.)  Applicant admitted all twelve Guideline F allegations.  (Item 3.)\nNothing in the record indicated Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were largely beyond his control.\nThere was no evidence in the record that he had sought or received consumer financial credit\ncounseling or that he had initiated a good-faith effort to repay his creditors or otherwise resolve his\ndebts.\nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant attended alcohol-\nrelated treatment in November 1993 (SOR \u00b6 2.a.); that he was arrested in March 1999, charged with\nDriving Under the Influence (DUI), convicted, placed on probation for 36 months, and assessed twelve\npoints on his driver\u2019s license (SOR \u00b6 2.b.); that he was arrested in October 2000, charged with DUI,\nconvicted, fined $336.90, and assessed eight points on his driver\u2019s license (SOR \u00b6 2.c.); that in\nDecember 2000, he was arrested, charged with DUI, convicted, sentenced to 18 months confinement\nwith 16 months suspended, placed on 16 months probation when released from confinement, ordered\nto undergo an alcohol evaluation and complete an alcohol rehabilitation program, fined $575, and\nassessed eight points on his driver\u2019s license (SOR \u00b62.d.).  The SOR also alleged that Applicant\nattended alcohol-related treatment in about December 2000 (SOR \u00b6 2.e.).  Additionally, the SOR\nalleged that in August 2001, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was revoked in an alcohol-related\nadministrative review point system hearing at which Applicant failed to appear, and Applicant\u2019s\nlicense remains listed as revoked/suspended in State A. (SOR \u00b62.f.)  Applicant admitted all six\nGuideline G allegations.  (Item 3.)  Applicant provided no evidence that his alcohol-related conduct\nwill not recur, that he has established a pattern of abstinence or responsible use, that, as an employee,\nhe is currently participating in a counseling or treatment program, or that he had successfully\ncompleted an inpatient or outpatient alcohol rehabilitation program, along with any required aftercare.\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct.  The SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested in February 1987, charged with\nDisorderly Conduct, a misdemeanor, and the charges were later dismissed (SOR \u00b6 3.a.); that he was\narrested in 1996, charged with Assault and Battery, convicted of Assault, and fined $2,500 (SOR \u00b6\n3.b.); that in December 1996, he was arrested and charged with Assault (SOR \u00b6 3.c.); that in November\n2001, Applicant was arrested, charged with Violation of Probation ordered in connection with his\narrest in allegation 2.d. above, convicted, and sentenced to 15 days in jail (SOR\u00b6 3.d.).\nDOHA also alleged Applicant was arrested in June 2002, charged with Assault and Battery on\na Family Member (a misdemeanor), ordered to attend anger management counseling, and the charges\nwere later dismissed (SOR \u00b6 3.e.); that he was arrested in June 2003, charged with Assault Second\nDegree, and his case was placed on the Stet Docket in about September 2003 (\u00b6 3.f.); and that in\nOctober 2003, he was arrested, charged with Domestic Violence/Assault Second Degree, sentenced\nto probation, and ordered not to have any contact with the person he had assaulted (SOR\u00b6 3.g.).\nDOHA also alleged Applicant\u2019s three convictions for DUI, as alleged under Guideline G in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b., 2.c., and 2.d., as criminal conduct under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 3.h.).  Applicant admitted\nall eight Guideline J allegations.  (Item 3.)  Applicant provided no evidence of successful rehabilitation\nor that his criminal conduct is unlikely to recur.\n\n4\nOn October 27, 2004, Applicant executed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86).\n(Item 4.)  Question 24 on the SF-86 asks an applicant if he or she has ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 24 and\nlisted the DUI alleged in SOR allegation 2.d.  He did not list his DUI convictions listed in SOR\nallegations 2.b. and 2.c.  DOHA alleged, under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that Applicant falsified\nmaterial facts on his SF-86 by failing to list the DUIs alleged at SOR 2.b. and 2.c. (SOR \u00b6 4.a.)\nApplicant denied the allegation. (Item 3.)\nQuestion 26 on the SF-86 asks an Applicant about his or her police record or other offenses.\nIt asks if an applicant has been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of offenses not listed in\nresponse to Questions 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25.  Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d and listed two arrests,\nViolation of Probation in November 2001 and Domestic Probation/No Contact With Person in October\n2003.  These arrests were alleged in SOR allegations 3.d. and 3.g.  He did not list the arrests alleged\nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e and 3.f.  DOHA alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant falsified material facts on\nhis SF-86 by failing to list the arrests alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 3.e. and 3.f. (SOR \u00b6 4.b.)  Applicant denied the\nallegation. (Item 3.)\nQuestion 39 on the SF-86 asks an applicant whether he or she is currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt.  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 39 and listed a credit card debt.  He\ndid not list the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., which were 90 days delinquent when he executed\nand signed his SF-86. (Item 6.)  DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified material\nfacts on his SF-86 by failing to list the delinquencies identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. (SOR \u00b6 4.c.)\nApplicant denied the allegation. (Item 3.)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 2, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified. The\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive\n5220.6 and Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other determinations\nin which a SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case\nwas issued November 16, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines apply.\n\n AG F 19(a) reads: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG F 19(c) reads: \u201ca history of not meeting\n3\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\n5\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions  and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline - Financial Considerations\nAn Applicant\u2019s failure to live within his means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.  See Guideline F, \u00b6 18.\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was responsible for twelve delinquent debts totaling\napproximately $17,700, which had not been satisfied as of November 3, 2006.  The allegations raised\nsecurity concerns under two Guideline F disqualifying conditions, 19(a) and 19(c).   Applicant\n3\nadmitted responsibility for the financial delinquencies, and he failed to offer credible evidence\nindicating he had paid or settled any of the debts.  \nThrough Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence, the Government established that\nApplicant had a history of not meeting his financial obligations and was unable or unwilling to satisfy\nhis debts as specified in Guideline F disqualifying conditions 19(a) and 19(c).   \nSeveral conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s remaining\nfinancial delinquencies.  Unresolved financial delinquency might be resolved if it happened so long\n\nDC 22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, child\n4\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  DC 22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \n6\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  (Guideline F,\n\u00b620(a)).  Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(b).)  Still other mitigating\ncircumstances that might be applicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problems is being resolved or\nis under control (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d)).\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies occurred recently and are numerous.  There\nis evidence in the record to suggest Applicant\u2019s financial over-extension is on-going and likely to\ncontinue in the future.  Applicant failed to provide evidence of mitigation under the mitigating\nconditions discussed above.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, attended alcohol-related treatment in 1993 and 2000.  He was\narrested for DUI once in 1999 and twice in 2000.  He failed to appear at an alcohol-related\nadministrative review point system hearing.  In 2002, his driver\u2019s license was revoked by State A.  In\nState A, his license remains revoked.  The alcohol-related conduct alleged in the SOR and admitted\nby Applicant raises concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 22(a) and (DC) 22(c).   His three\n4\nalcohol arrests away from work raise concerns under DC 22(a).  His admitted habitual consumption\nof alcohol to excess and sometimes to the point of intoxication from approximately 1993 to 2000 raises\nconcerns under DC 22 (c). \nUnder Guideline G, there are four conditions that could apply to Applicant\u2019s disqualifying\nconduct.  An applicant might mitigate disqualifying conduct under Mitigating Condition (MC)  23(a)\nof Guideline G if he provided credible evidence to show that so much time has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  An applicant\nmight also mitigate disqualifying conduct under MC 23(b) by acknowledging his or her alcoholism\nor issues of alcohol abuse, provid[ing] evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and. . .\nestablish[ing] a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nIf an applicant is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment\nprogram, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress, he\nmight be able to provide evidence of mitigation under MC 23 (c).  Finally, MC 23(d) might apply if\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along\nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in\n\nDC 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  DC 31(e) reads: \u201cviolation of parole or\n5\nprobation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program.\u201d \n7\nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of\na recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted excessive use of alcohol covered a period of approximately seven years.\nThe record reflects three alcohol-related arrests: one in 1999 and two in 2000.  Thus, his disqualifying\nbehavior was not infrequent.  Applicant failed to provide credible evidence that the conduct was not\nhabitual, unlikely to recur, and did not lead to concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness,\nand good judgment.  He failed to provide credible evidence of actions taken to overcome his alcohol\nproblem or to demonstrate abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nAccordingly, I conclude that MC 23(a) and MC 23(b) are inapplicable.\nApplicant provided no credible evidence he was participating, as an employee, in a\ncounseling or treatment program and making satisfactory progress.  He failed to provide evidence that\nhe had successfully completed inpatient or outpatient treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse and\nhad no history of relapse.  Additionally, he failed to show participation in a recommended program\nof aftercare or to provide evidence of a favorable prognosis.  Accordingly, I conclude MC 23(c) and\nMC 23(d) are inapplicable. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe record in this case shows that Applicant was arrested once in 1999 and twice in 2000 for\nalcohol-related criminal conduct. In addition, his criminal record included an arrest for Disorderly\nConduct in 1987; an arrest and conviction for Assault in 1996; a second arrest and charge of Assault\nin 1996; an arrest, charge, conviction and sentence of 15 days in jail for Violation of Probation in\n2001; an arrest and charge of Assault and Battery on a Family Member in 2002 (a misdemeanor),\nwhich was dismissed after Applicant attended court-ordered anger management counseling; and two\narrests in 2003, which resulted in a charge of Assault Second Degree and a charge of Domestic\nViolence/Assault Second Degree. \nCriminal conduct creates a security concern because it raises doubts about an individual\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Additionally, it raises doubts about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal activity raises\nsecurity concerns under Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 31(a) and 31(e)  of Guideline J.\n5\nTwo mitigating conditions under Guideline J might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under Mitigating Condition (MC) 32(a) if\nhe provided credible evidence to show that so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  MC 32(d) might apply\nif there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement. While Applicant\u2019s criminal activity is\nrecent, it also suggests a pattern of conduct, since it spans approximately 16 years, from 1987 to 2003.\n\n8\nThere is no evidence in the record to indicate successful rehabilitation.  Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct\nraises serious doubts not only about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment but also about\nhis ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations.  Applicant failed to provide credible evidence under\nMC 32(a)  and MC 32(d) to mitigate the criminal conduct alleged in the SOR.  No other MCs apply.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. Guideline E, \u00b6 15.   \nUnder Guideline E, a security concern is raised by an individual\u2019s deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. Guideline E, \u00b6 16(a). \nApplicant completed a SF-86 in October 2004.  Applicant\u2019s signed and dated SF-86 is entered\nin the record as Item 4.  In his responses to Question 24 on the SF-86, Applicant failed to list his\nalcohol-related arrests in March 1999 and October 2000.  In response to Question 27, Applicant failed\nto list his arrests for Assault and Battery on a Family Member in June 2002, and his arrest for Assault\nSecond Degree in June 2003.  In response to Question 39, Applicant failed to list two debts that were\n90 days delinquent.  The Government established a prima facie case that Applicant falsified his\nanswers to Questions 24, 27, and 39.  The burden of proof thus shifted to Applicant to rebut or mitigate\nthe Government\u2019s allegations.  Applicant denied he falsified his answers to the questions, but he\nprovided no credible evidence in support of his denials.  \nOne Guideline E mitigating condition (MC) might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nPursuant to MC 17(a),  personal conduct security concerns might be mitigated if the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts.  \nApplicant provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to list his alcohol-related\narrests in March 1999 and October 2000, his arrests for criminal conduct in June 2002 and June 2003,\nand his debts that were 90 days delinquent.  At the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant was a\nmature adult and a high school graduate.  Although he knew, or should have known, the importance\nof telling the truth to the Government, he had reason to attempt to minimize his knowledge of his\ndebts, his alcohol-related arrests, and his criminal conduct. His denials that his falsifications were\ndeliberate were not credible . He did not make good-faith efforts to correct his omissions, concealment,\nor falsifications before being confronted with the facts.  I conclude that MC 17(a) does not apply to\nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n9\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, an\nadministrative judge must thoroughly consider and review of all available reliable information about\nthe appellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.  DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, describes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe whole\nperson concept.\u201d  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish that he lacks sufficient income to\nmeet his monthly expenses.  The record also establishes that Applicant failed to offer evidence of\nalcohol rehabilitation and his alcohol-related conduct is likely to recur, a situation that casts doubt on\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct spans a period\nof 16 years, and he offered no evidence of rehabilitation, casting doubt on his trustworthiness.  Finally,\nApplicant deliberately misled the Government regarding the degree and seriousness of his financial\nsituation, his alcohol-related arrests, and his criminal conduct.  These actions cast serious doubts on\nhis security worthiness.\nIn ICR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states that an\nadministrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust consider the record as a\nwhole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s\nconduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that Applicant has neither\nrebutted nor mitigated the security concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR, and he has not\ndemonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.l.:\nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2.: Guideline G.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3.: Guideline J.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3. h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4.: Guideline E.: AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraphs 4.a. through 4.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 38 years old, divorced, and works as a supervisor of adjustments for a defense\ncontractor engaged in the health care industry.  Applicant has four alcohol-related driving arrests and\nconvictions, and two driving while revoked arrests.  He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in full\nremission, but failed to follow the alcohol assessment\u2019s aftercare recommendations.  He failed to\ndisclose his 2003 driving arrest on his trustworthiness application.  Applicant failed to mitigate the\ncriminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  Eligibility\nfor an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On August 18, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 10, 2006, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007.  On\nApril 19, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government and the\nApplicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  Applicant submitted exhibits\nsubsequent to the hearing and the Government had no objection to their admission into evidence.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 38 years old, divorced, and has two teenaged children.  He and his wife divorced\nin part due to his alcohol use.  He works as a supervisor of adjustments for a defense contractor in\nthe health services business.  He started with that company in February 2001.  His employee\nevaluations from May 2004 to May 2006, show he meets or exceeds all expectations set by his\nsupervisors.  He owns his own home. (Tr. 24, 25, 28, 56; Exhibits 1, A, B)\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated on May 7,\n1995.  No disposition of that charge is known.  Applicant drove while intoxicated on December 11,\n1996, and was arrested on that charge.  The charge included the allegation that it was his fourth such\noffense.  His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .1% or higher.  The state court found him guilty,\nfined him $1,610, ordered him to spend six months in jail, and to attend alcohol assessment classes.\nHe spent four or five months in jail pursuant to the court\u2019s sentence.  His driving privileges were\nrevoked for three years.  They have not be reinstated.  He currently has an occupational license,\nallowing him to drive to work, obtained on or after March 2006. (Tr. 27, 29, 30, 53; Exhibit 2;\nAnswer)\nApplicant was again arrested on August 12, 1999, and charged with operating a motor vehicle\nwhile intoxicated and operating a motor vehicle after suspension or revocation.  He was convicted\nof the intoxicated driving charge, and fined $,1736, ordered to spend 120 days in jail, had his driving\n\n4\nprivileges revoked for an additional 24 months, and ordered to take a mandatory alcohol assessment.\nApplicant drove while revoked at times after his arrest and conviction.  He also got to work being\ndriven by his wife when they were still married, until about December 2004 when they were\ndivorced. (Tr. 27, 50; Exhibits 2, 3; Answer)\nApplicant\u2019s next encounter with the law was an arrest on January 25, 2001, while attempting\nto get a cell phone from his wife with whom he got into an altercation.  He scratched her in the\nprocess.  She called the police.  He was charged with disorderly conduct and battery.  The charges\nwere later dismissed after he completed the deferred sentencing arrangement. (Exhibits 2, 3; Answer)\nThe next incident in which Applicant was involved was an arrest on October 5, 2003, when\nhe was arrested for driving while intoxicated, fifth offense.  The court found him guilty in March\n2005, sentenced him to nine months in jail, ordered to attend an alcohol assessment, suspended his\ndriving privileges for another three years, placed him on five years probation, and fined him $1,875.\nApplicant served six months of jail time, reduced by good behavior, on a work release program. (Tr.\n21, 22, 26, 30, 34; Exhibits 2; Answer)\nApplicant was arrested on March 21, 2005, for driving while revoked.  He was found guilty\nand fined $583. (Tr. 30, 50; Exhibit 2; Answer)\nApplicant claims he has been abstinent from alcohol since October, 2003.  Applicant\nadmitted he consumed alcohol to excess and to intoxication from approximately 1995 to at least\nOctober 2003.  He went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) from February 2005 to March 2006.  He\nceased his participation when he was in jail resulting from his last arrest and conviction for driving\nwhile intoxicated.  He claims he did not have the desire for alcohol, so the need for AA was not\npresent in his life.  He attended the alcohol assessment program required by the court after his March\n2005 conviction.  The counselor noted Applicant was there because of a sixth operating a vehicle\nwhile intoxicated offense.  The summary of his treatment, dated October 13, 2005, diagnoses\nApplicant as having alcohol dependence with physiological dependence in full sustained remission.\nDuring his treatment, the counselor found Applicant maintained sobriety and strengthened his\nrecovery program by AA participation and working with an AA sponsor.  The counselor noted\nApplicant was also attending church, attending AA meetings, and working with a recovery sponsor\nby the end of his treatment.  The program discharged him successfully with a good prognosis.  The\naftercare program recommendation was continued abstention from addictive substance use, \u201cwill\ncontinue to attend AA meetings and church and use the support of his sponsor.  (Applicant) will\nfollow through with his recovery program and driver\u2019s safety plan.\u201d  Applicant submitted this\nexhibit after the hearing, and at the hearing made no mention of church attendance or an AA sponsor.\nHe is not attending AA anymore.  The assessment is signed by a certified substance abuse counselor.\nApplicant obtained his current occupation driving privileges after completing the state-required\nassessment program.  (Tr. 26, 35, 41, 55; Exhibits 2, C; Answer)\nApplicant stated on the Government interrogatories he completed on June 15, 2006, that he\nattended AA \u201cusually about twice a month.  It really helps keep things in perspective.\u201d  At the\nhearing he admitted he ceased AA attendance on or about March 2006, a time before he wrote his\nanswer to the interrogatories.  His answers were notarized and he affirmed that they were \u201ctrue and\ncorrect to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d (Tr. 26; Exhibit 2)\n\n5\nApplicant completed his Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (85P) on May 28, 2003.\nHe signed the revised version on February 16, 2005.  Question 20 asked whether Applicant had been\narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses in the past seven years.  Applicant answered\n\u201cyes\u201d and disclosed his 1996 offense, his 1999 offense and conviction in 2000, and the 2001 battery\narrest.  In his February 2005 update of his 85P, he did not disclose the October 2003, arrest.\nApplicant claims the process was quick and his conviction was not finalized at that time, but his\n2003 arrest had already occurred.  The knowing and wilful making of a false statement to a U.S.\nGovernment agency is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, a felony offense.  His answer to the SOR\nclaims he discussed this conviction later with the Government investigator after February 2005, but\nthere is no documentary confirmation of such conversation in the evidence. (Tr. 17-19, 45; Exhibit\n2; Answer)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\n\n6\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. E2.A10.1.1\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption: The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often\nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and\nincreases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. E2.A7.1.1\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.1\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n7\nGuideline J: Applicant has four alcohol-related driving offenses listed in the SOR.  His\ncourt-ordered alcohol assessment notes he has six offenses for driving while intoxicated.  He has two\ndriving while revoked offenses listed in the SOR, and admitted to driving while revoked since his\n1996 revocation of driving privileges.  It was only in the past year he obtained an occupational\ndriving permit.  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that apply to these facts are DC 1 (allegations\nor admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.\nE2.A10.1.2.1) and DC 2 (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. E2.A10.1.2.2).\nApplicant has a history of driving while intoxicated.  He also has a history of driving while his\ndriving privileges are revoked, which ended only when he obtained an occupational license in March\n2006.  He wilfully and knowingly did not disclose his 2003 arrest on his 85P.\nConsidering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) under this guideline, I conclude none can be\napplied reasonably.  Applicant engaged in a pattern of law violations that only ended recently.  The\nalcohol-related driving offenses started in 1995 or before, and total six offenses according to the\nalcohol counselor.  Applicant voluntarily committed these offenses, as he did the driving while\nrevoked.  There is no evidence of successful rehabilitation of the alcohol problems because he has\nnot complied with the alcohol treatment aftercare recommendations.  Again, Applicant does what\nhe wants to do, not what the professionals or the law require him to do to conform his behavior to\nlawful behavior.  \nGuideline G: Applicant\u2019s alcohol and driving history make DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence. E2.A7.1.2.1), DC 4 (evaluation of\nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program. E2.A7.1.2.4), and DC 7 (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment. E2.A7.1.2.7) applicable.  Applicant has six alcohol-related driving\noffenses on his record, was diagnosed at a court-ordered alcohol assessment program as alcohol\ndependent, though in full remission if he maintained his support network, and has an eight-year\nhistory of habitual alcohol consumption.  Alcohol played a substantial part in his divorce.\nMC 3 (positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. E2.A7.1.3.3) and MC 4\n(following diagnosis of alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed outpatient\nrehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of AA or similar\norganizations, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and has received a\nfavorable prognosis from a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program. E2.A7.1.3.4) might apply.  \nHowever, Applicant did not comply with the aftercare recommendations when he ceased AA\nparticipation.  He made no mention of an AA sponsor at the hearing, so that relationship could not\nbe explored.  He made his own decision not to attend AA after only one year\u2019s participation\nfollowing an eight-year, at least, period of habitual alcohol consumption and multiple alcohol-related\ndriving arrests.  His claim of abstinence since October 2003 was not substantiated beyond his self-\nserving declaration.  He did not show any positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.  He\ndid not show any behavioral changes, except to state alcohol caused him too many problems.  In\naddition, I am dissuaded from applying either of these MC because Applicant misrepresented his AA\nparticipation and its duration in his interrogatory in June 2006, as compared to his testimony at the\nhearing.  His interrogatory answer led the Government to believe he continued to participate, yet at\n\n8\nthe hearing he stated he stopped AA participation in March 2006.  At the hearing, he did not bring\nor submit the alcohol assessment that is Exhibit C, so cross-examination by the Government of\ndiscrepancies and assertions therein could be explored.  I have serious doubts and concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s true relationship with alcohol in light of his history.  I conclude he has not persuaded\nme the MC should apply.  The burden of proof is on him that any MC should apply. \nGuideline E: Applicant deliberately did not disclose on his 85P his 2003 alcohol and driving\narrest when he recertified his answers on February 16, 2005.  He had been arrested, which action was\nwithin the scope of Question 20 on the 85P.  Hence, DC 2 (the deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, or similar\nform used to determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness E2.A5.1.2.2) applies.  His\ndecision not to disclose was, by his testimony, based on the fact that he had not yet been convicted\nof the offense.  That is not a persuasive explanation to excuse his failure to disclose.  He knew he\nhad been arrested, therefore he knew a fact that should have been disclosed.\nHis testimony at the hearing did not persuade me that any MC should apply, or that he had\na reasonable excuse for not disclosing his 2003 arrest.  It was certainly within the same genre of\nother arrests and convictions relating to alcohol that he did disclose.\nWhole Person Analysis: \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\"\ntrustworthiness decision. Directive E2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive\n\u00b6 E2.2.1. under the \u201cwhole person analysis.\u201d  His alcohol-related incidents are serious and occurred\nover an eight-year period.  They are frequent and recent.  They were voluntary, as was his decision\nto stop his participation in  alcohol rehabilitation and AA .  There is no substantive  evidence of\nrehabilitation provided by Applicant, except his own will power not to consume alcohol anymore.\nHe submitted no objective evidence of his abstinence.  There is a substantial risk of his behavior\nrecurring unless he establishes the support system recommended in the aftercare portion of his\nOctober 2005 assessment.\nThe Government set forth in the SOR two pages of trustworthiness concerns.  Applicant\u2019s\ninitial presentation at the hearing was that his job performance for the past six years, his own\nperception that he did not need AA participation, and his unsubstantiated sobriety should be a basis\nfor granting him a favorable trustworthiness decision.  However, the discrepancies between his\ninterrogatory answer on his AA participation and his testimony, and also his aftercare\nrecommendations and what he actually did, plus his entire history of multiple driving arrests and\nattitude toward driving while revoked, raise substantial doubts as to what Applicant\u2019s true\nrelationship toward alcohol is, how trustworthy he really is, and whether he can comply with\nGovernment requirements on trustworthiness.  Any doubt is to be resolved in favor of the national\ninterest.  Applicant failed to sustain his burden of proof that any MC should apply.\nI conclude the criminal conduct trustworthiness concern against him.  I also conclude the\nalcohol consumption trustworthiness concern against him.  The personal conduct trustworthiness\nconcern is concluded against him.  Lastly, the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d I conclude against him.  \n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid E. Lasker, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 22-year-old student who works part-time for a company that administers\ngovernment health care benefits.  In 2002, she was arrested for theft, a misdemeanor, arising from an\n\n2\nincident at work.  In 2004, she was convicted of the charge after she did not comply with all terms of\na Deferred Prosecution Program.  The Government alleged she failed to disclose the 2002 arrest, her\nprevious employment position, and subsequent termination, during the application process for an ADP\nclearance.  She mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by criminal and personal conduct.  Her\neligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 29, 2003, Applicant submitted a public trust position application (SF-85P).  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under Department\nof Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, (Jan. 1987), as amended (Regulation),\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Personnel Review Program\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, (Directive). On July 27, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines J (criminal conduct), and E (personal\nconduct) of the Directive.\nIn a sworn statement, dated September 25, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing.  On October 16, 2006, this case was assigned to me. A Notice of Hearing was\nissued on November 9, 2006, setting the case for hearing on November 27, 2006.  At the hearing\nDepartment Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 into evidence without objections.\nApplicant testified in her case and introduced Applicant Exhibit (AX) A into evidence without an\nobjection.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2006.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nOn October 12, 2006, Department Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the SOR by deleting the\nfollowing language from the first paragraph of the SOR: \u201cparagraph 3-614, Department of Defense\nRegulation 5220.2-R and.\u201d Applicant did not object to the amendment and I granted the Motion (Tr.\n7).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 22 years old and a student at a local college, studying electron microscopy.  (Tr.\n60) She lives with her parents (Tr. 65).  In September 2002, Applicant began a part-time position with\na company that administers a government health insurance plan.  \nApplicant admitted that in December 2002, she was arrested and charged with Theft-Movable\nProperty, a misdemeanor.  She was 18 years old at the time.  In March 2003, she pled guilty and was\nplaced in a Deferred Prosecution Program.  She was ordered to pay $209 in fines, attend a class for\nwomen offenders, write an apology to the victim, and complete 50 hours of community service.  Upon\ncompletion of the terms, the criminal charge would be dropped (Tr. 31).  The arrest arose after she stole\n\n3\n$50 from a customer\u2019s wallet that was left at a check out counter where she had been working part-time\nfor about five months (Tr. 33).  Immediately after the incident, the employer suspended her and\nterminated her in June or July of 2003. (Tr. 34; 53).\nIn May 2003, Applicant\u2019s present employer gave her a SF-85P to complete because they\nreceived a government contract that required employees to have ADP clearances.  The employer did\nnot provide her or her co-workers with any assistance or instructions for completing the application (Tr.\n65).  Based on advice from her parents and friends, she did not disclose the March 2003 arrest because\nshe thought her participation in the deferred prosecution program exempted her from including it under\nQuestion 20. Your Police Record (Tr. 38).  She did not disclose her previous part-time employment\nunder Question 11. Your Employment Activities because she was told she did not \u201chave to list a job if\nyou haven\u2019t worked there for six months or more, or it\u2019s -- it\u2019s considered a temporary job, not a long\nterm,\u201d (Id.).  She did not list any information under Question 12. Your Employment Record because she\nhad not been terminated from that prior part-time job when she completed the form.  She was 19 years\nat the time she initially filled out the SF-85P.\nIn October 2003, someone from the Human Resources Department (HR) handed Applicant her\nSF-85P and pointed out specific sections that needed to be corrected or changed, such as addresses and\nzip codes (Tr. 41-42).  She did not know she was required to reread and update all sections of the form\nat that time, which would have required her to list the employment termination that occurred in July\n2003 (Tr. 57).\nIn August 2004, the government revoked the deferred prosecution and sentence agreement\nbecause Applicant did not complete all 50 hours of community service, and the court entered a guilty\nfinding.  Although she completed the classroom requirements for the women\u2019s offender program, wrote\nan apology letter, and paid the fine, she was unable to complete 15 hours because she was in a car\naccident that left her without transportation to the community service center (Tr. 54 ).  She did not\nfinish her first semester of college as a result of the accident either (Tr. 64).  She was unrepresented\nthroughout the criminal proceeding and had limited awareness of the importance of complying with all\nterms of the agreement (Tr. 30;65).\nIn February 2005, HR again approached Applicant regarding the correction of other sections on\nthe SF-85P, e.g., the name of her current supervisor (Tr. 43).  Because no one advised her to carefully\nreview the document in its entirety and update any section where circumstances had changed since she\ninitially filled it out in March 2003, she addressed HR\u2019s specific requests, resigned the application, and\ndid not disclose the 2003 termination or criminal conviction entered in 2004 (Tr. 59).  She admitted she\ndid not list her prior part-time employment, subsequent termination, and criminal charge on the form\nthroughout the application process as alleged, but denied that she deliberately falsified the application\n(Tr. 66).  Based on her testimony and demeanor, I find her explanation credible.\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s supervisors testified.  Her immediate supervisor for the past two years\nconsiders Applicant to be a very conscientious employee who does an excellent job (Tr. 14).  The Unit\nCoordinator has known Applicant for 12 years and has been her unit\u2019s supervisor for the last two years.\nShe stated Applicant \u201cconsistently achieves an expected average of 99.9 percent in regards to quality,\nand she also handles tasks that nobody else in the mail room does, and she does excellent work,\u201d (Tr.\n19).  Applicant\u2019s Performance Reviews from September 2002 through September 2006 consistently\nnote that she achieves company\u2019s expectation in many categories and exceeds expectations in other\n\n4\ncategories (AX A).  None of her job duties have changed since she was hired, including her access to\nsensitive information (Tr. 46).\nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. Regulation\n\u00b6AP10.2.1.  ADP III positions are nonsensitive positions. Regulation AP102.3.1.  By memorandum\ndated November 19, 2004, the Deputy under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security\ndirected DOHA to resolve all contractor cases submitted for trustworthiness determinations, including\nADP I, II, and III, under the Directive.  Thus, even though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III\ncases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP\nI and II cases.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6 C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions associated with each guideline.  DoD contractor personnel are\nafforded the adjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admission in her Answer to the SOR and at\nthe hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline a trustworthiness concern may exist when a pattern of criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish a potential disqualification\nunder disqualifying condition (DC) 1: (Any conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged).  In 2002, Applicant was arrested for theft and pled guilty to the charge in 2004.\nThe Government having raised a trustworthiness concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nmitigate or rebut the allegations.  Applicant has not been involved in any form of criminal conduct since\nDecember 2002, four years ago.  She continues to pursue a college degree and has maintained\nsatisfactory work performance ratings at her current job since she was hired in September 2002.  She\nacknowledged her mistake and embarrassment by her conduct.  Based on that evidence, mitigating\ncondition (MC) 5: (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) applies to this case.  \nThe allegation contained in SOR \u00b6 1.b., claiming that Applicant\u2019s falsification of her SF-85P\nconstituted a felony under federal law, is concluded in her favor based on a determination set forth\nunder Guideline E that she did not deliberately omit information.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\n5\nA trustworthiness concern may arise when an individual\u2019s conduct involves questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation. \nThe Government alleged Applicant falsified her SF-85P in March 2003, October 2004, and\nFebruary 2005 by failing to disclose her 2002 part-time employment, the 2003 termination, and\nDecember 2002 arrest, which constituted a potential disqualification under DC 2: (The deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status determines security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) of this guideline.  Applicant admitted that she did\nnot disclose the information, but denied that she intentionally did so.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred.  ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)\n(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nWhen Applicant completed the SF-85P in March 2003, she did not disclose the December 2002\narrest because she was on a deferred prosecution program and thought she was not required to include\nit.  She did not disclose her former part-time job on the belief that she had worked there less than six\nmonths and it was not a permanent position.  In October 2003, she was still on the deferred prosecution\nprogram when her employer requested minor corrections to specified questions.  In February 2005, her\nemployer again directed her to revise specific sections of the application and did not advise her to\nreview and update the entire form if circumstances transpired.  As a result of her inexperience, lack of\nadvice, and reliance on the specific directions given to her by her employer each time she was asked\nto correct and resign the form, she did not disclose information about the 2002 arrest, prior job, and\nsubsequent termination.  However, her failure was due to a lack of knowledge and assistance in\ncompleting the form, rather than a deliberate attempt to mislead the Government.  Hence, I conclude\nshe did not intentionally falsify her SF-85P.  Accordingly, the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through\n2.c. are concluded in her favor.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nSection E.2. of Enclosure of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables\nin a case as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative\njudge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s young age at the time of the theft and now, the consistent lack of competent assistance and\ndirection from her employer throughout the application process, as well as her sincere demeanor while\ntestifying and candid disclosure about the theft charge, coupled with her overall embarrassment and\nremorse about the incidents underlying this case.  I took into account her educational pursuits and\nsatisfactory performance in her part-time job over the last four years.  I gave significant weight to her\nsupervisors\u2019 credible testimony, including the fact that she has competently performed the same job for\nthe past four years without an ADP clearance and demonstrated that she takes her position seriously.\nI also believe that the behavior underlying the issues raised in the SOR will not recur in the future as\na result of her current understanding of the ADP application process and criminal justice system.\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by her criminal and personal conduct.  Accordingly,\nGuidelines J and E are concluded for her.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by\nSection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.S1.b.: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a.S2.c.: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility is granted.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) , DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. \nOn September 6, 2006, and September 14, 2006 Applicant submitted a notarized response\nto the SOR), and elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department\nCounsel submitted the government's written case on January 18, 2007. Applicant received a\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on January 29, 2007, along with notice of his opportunity\nto file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case.1\nApplicant did not submit any information or written response by February 28, 2007. The case was\nassigned to me on March 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, \u00b6 1.a through 1.c are incorporated\nherein. He denied allegation 1.d and 1.e.  In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the\n2\nevidence and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 54-year-old mechanic working for a defense contractor. He has been married\nsince 1973, and has no children.  He has never held a security clearance. He has had steady\n3\nemployment for the past ten years. Applicant has been in his current position since 2003.4\nIn March 1991, he filed his first bankruptcy. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy was converted to\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 12, 1991, and discharged on August 7, 1991. Applicant provided\nno information concerning the events that led to this bankruptcy.5\n\n Item 9 (Bankruptcy Petition, dated September 27, 2005) at 1-26.\n6\n Item 7 (Applicant's Interrogatories, dated July 24, 2006) at 1-15.\n7\nId.\n8\n Id.\n9\n Personal Financial Statement, dated 2005.\n10\n4\nOn September 27, 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His liabilities  totaled $54,\n670.  This bankruptcy was discharged on or about January 10, 2006. There is no information in the\nrecord concerning the reason that Applicant filed for bankruptcy for a second time.6\nApplicant does not deny that he is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount\nof $3,058 for a federal tax lien filed on or about September 2005. His current credit report confirms\nthis lien. He stated that he is working on a resolution to this problem.7\nApplicant denied that he was indebted to the state for $488 for a lien placed on or about July\n1992. He also denied that he owed state taxes for the tax year 2004. However, he attached a  letter\nfrom the state department of revenue that he owes $503.39 for state taxes for the year 2004.\nApplicant offered no evidence that he has paid either tax lien.8\nIn his interrogatories, Applicant reported that he is honest and that he is working on a plan\nwith the IRS and the state department of revenue. He emphasized that the bankruptcies are a legal\nmeans of discharging debt.9\nApplicant earns approximately $3,802.68 a month in gross wages. His net income is\n$2,794.50.  After his monthly expenses of $2,642.84, he has a $5.00 negative remainder. He listed\na payment of $156.66 to a 401(k) loan. He has approximately $14,000 in his 401(k).10\n \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Additionally, each security clearance decision must\nbe a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically\nthese are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation, (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct, (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n11\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n12\n Department of the Navy v.

The government\n11\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n12\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n13\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n14\ndecision.15\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n16\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n17\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n18\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n19\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. An individual who is financially overextended is\nat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nIn this matter, the government has established a prima facie case for allegations 1.a through\n1.e. under Guideline F. It produced substantial evidence that Applicant has accrued debt over the\nyears. He admits he owes $3,058 to the IRS for a federal tax lien. His credit report confirms state tax\nliens. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (a\n\n6\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant's debt problems\nhave been ongoing for a number of years.  Although a legally permissible method of dealing with\ndebt, Applicant has filed for bankruptcy twice. Thus, he has not established a mitigating condition\nunder  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (the behavior was not recent) nor FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (it was an isolated\nincident). \nApplicant presented no information concerning any events that would support FC MC\nE2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nHe has not received financial counseling. Despite the fresh start from bankruptcy, he still has\nunpaid debt. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC)  E2.A6.1.3.4. (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nApplicant is aware of his financial problems. His bankruptcies do not relieve him of a duty\nto be financially responsible. He has unpaid federal and state tax liens. FC MC E2.A6.1. (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does\nnot apply in this case.\nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his\noutstanding debts, but whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security clearance decision. \nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis a mature individual with a record of steady employment. He has a long history of financial\nproblems. He filed for bankruptcy on two occasions. He still has delinquent state and federal taxes.\nHe has not availed himself of any counseling. He has been indebted over the past 15 years to multiple\ncreditors. His personal budget indicates a negative net remainder each month. This raises doubt as\nto his ability to pay his tax debts. It also raises the possibility that he will most likely accrue new debt.\nApplicant has not  yet developed a repayment plan pertaining to the tax debts. He has not established\na track record of financial stability. Under the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has\nnot met his burden of proof in demonstrating his eligibility to hold a clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.       \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.      \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.       \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nNoreen A. Lynch.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has\nnot yet demonstrated a commitment to abstain from alcohol, so doubt remains over reform of his\nrecent criminal and alcohol-related conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on January 26, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over Alcohol\n1\nConsumption (Guideline G) in paragraph 1, and Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 2\nbased on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005, and\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to\nthese SOR allegations in an Answer notarized, but undated, where he admitted all of the allegations\nin paragraph 1, but denied subparagraph 2.a.  He requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on March 21, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to me on March 28, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was\nagreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on March 30, 2007, set the matter for April 19, 2007, at a\nlocation near where Applicant works and lives.\nAt the hearing the Government offered eight exhibits  (Exhibits 1-8) which were admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified.  I left the record open for a week for Applicant\nto submit additional evidence.  (TR 61-62)  He submitted Exhibit A on April 27,2007.  Government\ncounsel indicated no objection, so the document was admitted into evidence. The transcript (TR) was\nreceived on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 43 years old, has worked as an electronic technician for a defense contractor in\nState #1 from April 2004 to present.  He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in\nApril 2004 as he is seeking a clearance.  Previously, he worked at four other private sector\ncompanies from 1998 to 2004. He has not served in the military. (Exhibit 1; TR 31) He is a high\n\n3\nschool graduate.  (TR 31)\nApplicant married in 1987, separated from his spouse in October 2002, and divorced in 2004.\nHe has three children, ages 19 and twins age 14. (Exhibits 1, 8; TR 30, 45) He was able to move\nback into his own home in June 2006 as his wife inherited her mother\u2019s home.  (TR 58-60)\nAlcohol and Criminal Conduct\nApplicant began to drink alcohol in 1998 and continues to consume alcohol, at times to\nexcess and to the point of intoxication.  His drinking increased after he was divorced in October\n2004 as he missed his children.  He then drank every weekend either at home or with friends.  In his\nResponse to Interrogatories he reported he was last intoxicated in July 2006.  Even though he sees\nhimself as an alcoholic, he stated he intends to continue to drink alcoholic beverages, but will not\ndrink to excess or drink and drive.  He plans to limit himself to six or seven beers. (Answer; Exhibit\n2; TR 28-29; 44-45; 51-53; 57-58)  He testified he decided in February 2007 to stop drinking, but\nhe did not keep his own promise to himself.  He continued to drink moderately in March and April,\napproximately a six-pack per week.  (TR 57-58)  He does not go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nas \u201ceveryone\u201d tells him \u201cthey\u2019re stupid.\u201d (TR 29) (SOR 1.a.) \nApplicant has three alcohol-related arrests:\n\u2022  \nHe was stopped for not having a light on his license plate in November 1998 and charged\nwith operating a motor vehicle while consuming alcohol in State #1.  His jail sentence was\nsuspended; he received two years unsupervised probation.(Answer; TR 32-33-36) (SOR 1.b.)\n\u2022\nHe reported on his SF 86 that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of an\nAlcoholic Beverage (DUI) in State #2 in December 2001. He had been drinking at home\n(probably ten beers) and then drove to a bar with some friends and drank more.  He was\nstopped for swerving.  He was fined and sentenced to three years probation.  (Answer;\nExhibit 1) He paid a fine of $1,238 in full.  He completed a Department of Motor Vehicles\n(DMV) 3-month program in September 2002.  His license was then reinstated. (Exhibit 2;\nTR 37-40)  (SOR 1.c.) \n\u2022\nApplicant went to a retirement party from work in December 2005 after his co-workers\nassured him that someone would give him a ride home.  He drank approximately seven beers.\nWhen his co-workers did not give him a ride home, he drove himself home even though he\nwas fatigued.  He fell asleep while driving and rolled the car five times, but was not injured.\n(TR 25-26; 41-42)  He was arrested in State #1 and charged with DUI, fined, and sentenced\nto ten days work release, and three years unsupervised  probation. (Answer; Exhibit 7; TR\n43) He paid a fine in full of $2,743 and spent ten days in jail on work release.  He also had\nto have an ignition lock put on his car, so it would not start if it detected alcohol; it costs $80\nper month.  He had to take two different alcohol education and treatment classes.

He has\ncomplied with this requirement.  (SOR 2.a.)

He is an asset to our shop and mission.\u201d  (Exhibit A)\nHis current supervisor for three years praised Applicant\u2019s \u201ctechnical ability, professionalism,\nand customer service\u201d as outstanding.  He described him as being level-headed and having a \u201ccan-\ndo-attitude.\u201d  He is an asset to the section.   (Exhibit A)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding\nwhether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, an administrative judge\nweighs the relevant revised Adjudication Guidelines and considers the evidence as a whole.  \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then, the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision\nto grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n3\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\n\n       \u00b6 22. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) alcohol-\n4\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.   (b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or\nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent. (d) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; (f)\nrelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of  an alcohol rehabilitation program;\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\n5\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline G --Alcohol Consumption\n\u00b6 21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s problem drinking and his\nalcohol-related arrests in 1998, 2001, and 2005.  Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within disqualifying\nconditions (DC) \u00b6 22.  which raise security concerns: In Applicant\u2019s case the relevant DC are \u00b6\n4\n22.(a), alcohol-related incidents, such as driving under the influence, and \u00b6 22. (c), habitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  The most recent alcohol-related arrest in 2005\nillustrates Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment:  Applicant made a decision to drive home from a bar\neven though he was intoxicated and fatigued.  Falling asleep while drive, he rolled the car and was\ncharged with DUI.  He paid a substantial fine and was sentenced to ten days work release and three\nyears of unsupervised probation with required alcohol education and therapy sessions. In 2006 he\ndid complete the court required alcohol education. \nEven after these three alcohol-related arrests, Applicant has continued intermittently to drink,\nat times to excess. While Applicant has never been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem, he\ncontinues to drink even in the face of his own stated desire to stop drinking.  He has never sought\nsupport from AA or a similar group that might assist him keep a commitment to sobriety.  To his\ncredit, three individuals from his workplace praised his work performance. Nevertheless, I conclude\nthat Applicant failed to mitigate these alcohol-related security concerns.  In light of the seriousness\nof his repeated arrests and his own characterization of himself as an alcoholic, he provided\n\n       \u00b6 23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  (a) so much time has passed, or the\n5\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals current\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement; (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser); (c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress; (d)\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired after-care requirements, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified  medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\n6\ninsufficient evidence to demonstrate that he falls squarely within the mitigating conditions.   \n5\n Notably, under MC  \u00b6 23.(a), his December 2005 arrest is recent.  He has been unable to\nmaintain his own decision to stop drinking.  Given this recency, he does not meet the test that \u201cso\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individuals reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Under MC \u00b6 23.(b), while not officially diagnosed, Applicant\nhas acknowledged issues with alcohol abuse and provided evidence of several actions he has taken\nto overcome this problem. While he did comply with the court orders to take an alcohol-awareness\nclass, he has not established a practice of abstinence from alcohol despite his intent to do so.  \nWhile his supervisor views his work performance as  good, his supervisor did not\nrecommend him for a security clearance.  Nether has Applicant sought out an ongoing individual or\ngroup treatment program. Thus, I conclude he failed to establish MC  \u00b6 23. (c), the individual is a\ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of\nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress. He has shown some positive\nchanges in behavior by his decision not to again drive and drink and has complied with the court\nordered requirements.  On the other hand, he has no record of abstinence from alcohol, so he has not\nmet the expectations of MC \u00b6 23.(d.).  He has avoided any participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has not documented that he received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified  medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member\nof a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n  \nAfter considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule\nagainst Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n\u00b6 30.  The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n       \u00b6 31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) a single\n6\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\n       32. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (a) so much time has elapsed since the\n7\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) the person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution,\njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n7\nThe government established security concerns under criminal conduct  over a September\n6\n2006 guilty plea to a misdemeanor assault charge (\u00b6 2.a.) and also include concerns over his\npreviously discussed alcohol-related arrests (\u00b6 2.b.).  Disqualifying conditions include: \u00b6 31. (a),  a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and \u00b6 31. (d), individual is currently on parole or\nprobation.  He has complied with the conditions of probation from his 1998, 2001, 2006 convictions;\nbut he is still remains on three years probation from his December 2005 conviction.  \nOverall Applicant provided insufficient evidence of mitigation : Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct\n7\nis too recent to be mitigated under MC \u00b6 32.(a).  Applicant failed to demonstrate evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation under MC \u00b6 32. (d).  While it has been over a year without recurrence of\nany criminal activity, he failed to provide evidence of abstinence from alcohol as an indicator he will\nnot re-offend.  While he established an fine employment record, that by itself is insufficient to\nmitigate.  He has failed to demonstrate his commitment to being alcohol free and is still on probation\nfrom his December 2005 arrest, so security concerns persist. \nThus, after looking at the whole person and considering the Adjudicative Process factors and\nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. under SOR\nParagraph 2.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames F. Campbell, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 11, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 26, 2010, after the hearing,\n\nAdministrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 48-year-old employee\nof a Defense contractor.  He held a security clearance from 1985 to 2002.  Applicant had a previous\nsecurity clearance case adjudicated by a DOHA Judge.  In the prior adjudication, the Judge found\nagainst Applicant under Guideline E and in favor of Applicant under Guideline G.  Applicant\nappealed that decision.  The Appeal Board affirmed the adverse decision.  Three of the current\nallegations under Guideline G and eight of the current allegations under Guideline E were also at\nissue in the prior adjudication.\nTh Judge found the Findings of Fact from the first Judge\u2019s decision fully supported by the\nevidence and adopted them and incorporated them by reference.  \nIn October 1998, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI).  Applicant\nwas very intoxicated that night .  Applicant\u2019s friend drove Applicant\u2019s car.  There was an accident\nand the friend left to find a tow truck, leaving Applicant at the site.  Applicant, with a blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) of .24%, was formally charged, but the DUI was later dismissed without trial when\nthe friend told the prosecutor he had been driving.\nBetween August 1998 and October 2000, Applicant was cited seven times for traffic\nviolations.  He admits committing six of the violations. One charge (Driving While License\nSuspended) was an error and was so determined by a court.\nIn July 2001, Applicant was stopped for speeding and his BAC registered at .191%.  He was\narrested and charged with DUI.  In February 2002, he successfully completed an alcohol treatment\nprogram for a diagnosed condition of Alcohol Abuse.  He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of\nNegligent Driving First Degree.\nIn December 2005, Applicant was cited for speeding.\nIn December 2006, Applicant was stopped twice in Canada for speeding.  On the second\nstop, he was also cited for an open alcohol container, although he claimed not to know it was there.\nIn late December 2006 Applicant drank several beers with a meal before crossing the border\ninto Canada.  He was arrested at 6:30 pm.  He told the officer he had had one beer at 4:00 pm.  At\n10:11 his BAC was .110% and at 10:49 .120%.  Due to technical flaws in the timing, charges were\nnot filed.\nIn February 2008, Applicant was in a traffic accident with a police car.  He provided two\nbreath samples which both registered .068%.  A blood sample taken later had a reading .05% which\n\nis presumed under state law to mean that he was not driving under the influence.  No charges were\nfiled, which meant under state law that he was detained not arrested.  The police report showed the\nofficer was at fault.\nApplicant admitted consuming alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication or\nimpairment from 1997 to 2008.  Applicant\u2019s reports as to his last drink are somewhat inconsistent.\nIn the context of 2004 DOHA proceedings, Applicant obtained a psychologist\u2019s report which\nstated that his substance use/abuse was within normal limits and that he had ceased drinking alcohol\nwhen away from home.  It said he was at no more than a normal risk for alcohol abuse and very little\nrisk for alcohol dependence.\nApplicant omitted his 2004 consultation with the psychologist from his 2007 security\nclearance application.  Given the context of the event, the wording of the question and Applicant\u2019s\ncredible explanation this was not a deliberate falsification.\nThere is no record evidence to support allegation 2.m.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  After reviewing the record,\nthe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based on substantial\nevidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the\nrecord.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-11564 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).\nApplicant presumes that the decision to permit his reapplication for a security clearance to\ngo forward equated to an adjudication in Applicant\u2019s favor on the substance of the issues alleged in\nthe SOR.  Such is not the case.  The Administrative Judge was not barred from ruling against\nApplicant on issues raised by the SOR merely because of the reapplication decision.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.38 - \u00b6 E3.1.41.\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions on the grounds that\nthe government had failed to meet its burden. Applicant\u2019s premise is mistaken; the government\u2019s\nburden is only to present witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted.  Beyond that the burden of persuasion lay with the Applicant.  Directive, \u00b6\nE3.1.14 and \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Where the Department Counsel failed to present evidence, as with allegation\n2.m., the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  Once substantial evidence had been presented on the\ncontroverted allegations, it was up to Applicant to mitigate, explain, rebut, or refute.  Department\nCounsel never has the burden of refuting a mitigating condition.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider record evidence, such as Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the case record.\nSee, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 09-05830 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2010).  In this case, the Judge discussed\nApplicant\u2019s recent abstinence, the psychologist\u2019s report and the passage of time since Applicant\u2019s\nomissions from his security clearance applications.  However, he also explained why he concluded\nthat Applicant\u2019s evidence was not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns.\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief does not rebut the presumption that the Judge considered the entire record.  Nor\ndoes it demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in the record in an arbitrary or capricious\nmanner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).  To the extent that\nApplicant is arguing for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence, such argument is not\nsufficient to demonstrate error by the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-08944 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov.\n3, 2009).\nApplicant cites his favorable adjudication in the past.  It is well settled that the government\nis not estopped from reconsidering the security significance of past conduct. See ISCR Case. No.\n07-00260 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2008):\nPrior security clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the\nApplicant have no bearing on the legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision here.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).  The\ngovernment is not estopped from making an adverse clearance decision when there\nwere prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-24506 at 3 (App.\nBd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider the\nsecurity significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct\nor circumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No.\n91-0775 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nMay 19, 2004).\nApplicant suggests that the Judge should have analyzed in a piecemeal fashion.  The Board\nhas previously made clear that such analysis is contrary to the objective of accomplishing a\nreasonable interpretation of the full evidentiary record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.04-12648 at 3-4\n(App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2006) citing, in part, Raffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken\ntogether, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in\nisolation).\n  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of Negligent Driving First Degree. In December 2005, Applicant was cited for speeding. In December 2006, Applicant was stopped twice in Canada for speeding. On the second stop, he was also cited for an open alcohol container, although he claimed not to know it was there.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James F. Campbell, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was denied a security clearance in 2005 based on personal conduct\nconcerns. He engaged in multiple incidents of similar conduct, some alcohol-related,\nduring the ensuing three years. The evidence is insufficient to mitigate resulting security\nconcerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 6, 2007.  On\n1\nAugust 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nG (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\nMay 26, 2010\n\nGE 1.\n2\nGE 15.\n3\nThe allegations set forth in the present SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (but with an Oct. 2002 end date), 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 2.a, 2.d,\n4\n2.e, 2.f, 2.g, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j, were all included in the May 6, 2004 SOR.\n2\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense on September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 8, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (AR) on September 28, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 19,\n2009, and the case was assigned to a different administrative judge on the following\nday. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November 17, 2009, setting the hearing for\nDecember 10, 2009. On December 3, 2009, that administrative judge granted\nApplicant\u2019s motion for a continuance until the week of January 18, 2010. On December\n23, 2009, DOHA reassigned the case to me. DOHA issued a revised Notice of Hearing\non December 24, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 19, 2010.\nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 15, which were admitted without\nobjection. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through E, which were also admitted without\nobjection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on January 27, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a major defense contractor, where he\nbegan working in March 2002. He has no military service. He held a security clearance\nfrom June 1985 to February 2002 while working for a different major defense contractor,\nand the clearance transferred with him when he changed jobs. He is single with no\nchildren.  In his response to the SOR, he formally admitted the factual allegations set\n2\nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, 2.d through 2.j, and 2.l, with some explanations. He\ndenied the remaining SOR allegations, also with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nincluding his statements in response to DOHA interrogatories,  are incorporated in the\n3\nfollowing findings.\nDOHA issued a previous SOR to Applicant, which also cited security concerns\nunder Guidelines G and E, on May 6, 2004.  After a hearing, a different administrative\n4\njudge found for Applicant on the Guideline G allegations, because the alcohol-related\nincidents had occurred several years earlier, there was no indication of a recent\nproblem, and Applicant had successfully completed an alcohol-rehabilitation program.\nHowever, the administrative judge found against Applicant on the Guideline E\nallegations, because his pattern of numerous violations of state traffic codes indicated a\nflagrant disregard for the law and suggested an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations. Furthermore, he concluded that Applicant deliberately omitted and\nconcealed relevant and material facts concerning his October 1998 alcohol-related\n\nGE 11. This decision, ISCR Case No. 03-08475, was dated March 2, 2005.\n5\nSee Note 1, supra.\n6\nGE 11; Tr. 39, 123.\n7\nAR; GE 3; GE 4; AE C; Tr. 46-47.\n8\nAR; GE 5; GE 6; GE 7; GE 8; GE 9; GE 11; GE 12; GE 14; Tr. 123-124.\n9\n3\narrest and criminal charge from his November 1999 security clearance application. The\nadministrative judge found that Applicant had failed to meet his burden to mitigate the\nresulting personal conduct security concerns and denied his eligibility to continue\nholding a security clearance.  Applicant appealed this adverse decision, which the\n5\nAppeal Board affirmed on September 14, 2005.  The findings and conclusions of the\n6\nadministrative judge who decided that case are not binding precedent. After thorough\nreview of that hearing transcript (GE 14), Applicant\u2019s response to that SOR (GE 12),\nand the other exhibits pertinent to the allegations contained therein (GE 2 through 10), I\nfind that the Findings of Fact set forth in the administrative judge\u2019s decision (GE 11) are\nfully supported by the evidence, and they are adopted and incorporated herein by\nreference. I will draw independent conclusions by applying applicable AG and whole-\nperson factors to the complete and updated facts and circumstances established by all\nthe evidence.\nIn October 1998, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI).\nHe had been at a bar drinking and commiserating with a friend after breaking up with his\ngirlfriend. He was very intoxicated, so his friend drove Applicant\u2019s car when they left the\nbar. They had an accident, and the friend left the site to find a tow truck. Applicant\nremained with the car, and was arrested when police responded. His blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) was .24%. After he was formally charged with this offense, his friend told\nthe prosecutor that he, not Applicant, had been the driver on the evening in question.\nThe DUI charge was subsequently dismissed without trial.7\nBetween August 1998 and October 2000, Applicant was cited seven different\ntimes for the traffic violations as set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.j. He admitted\ncommitting all of those offenses, except the Driving While License Suspended offense\nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. The court later determined that Applicant\u2019s license had been suspended\nin error for non-payment of an earlier fine that he had actually paid on time.  \n8\nOn July 21, 2001, Applicant was stopped for speeding while driving home from a\nbar. He failed a field sobriety test, and a portable breath registered his BAC at .191%.\nHe was arrested and charged with DUI. From August 19, 2001, to February 14, 2002,\nhe successfully completed an alcohol treatment program for a diagnosed condition of\nAlcohol Abuse. In February 2002, pursuant to a plea agreement, Applicant plead guilty\nto the lesser charge of Negligent Driving First Degree, and was sentenced as described\nin SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n9\n\nAR; AE C; Tr. 47-49, 58-59, 92-93.\n10\nAR; GE 15; Tr. 34-35, 94-101. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 2.l to conform to\n11\nthe evidence by inserting the word \u201ctwice\u201d between the words \u201ccited\u201d and \u201con.\u201d \nAR; GE 15; Tr. 35-36, 81-84, 88-90, 117-121.\n12\n4\nOn December 26, 2005, Applicant was cited for speeding in Nebraska, vice\nCalifornia as originally alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. This violation occurred when he entered a\nconstruction zone and failed to notice the reduced speed limit. I granted Department\nCounsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence by correcting the name\nof the state.10\nOn December 29, 2006, Applicant began a trip to visit Canada for the New\nYear\u2019s holiday. The previous day he had hosted a party at his house, at which he had\none cooler with beer and another with soft drinks. He brought the soft drink cooler with\nhim on the trip, setting it on the front passenger seat. He was stopped twice, a few\nhours apart, and cited for speeding. During the second stop, the police officer searched\nhis car and found an empty beer can in the soft drink cooler. Applicant was also cited\nand fined for an open alcohol container violation, despite his claim that he did not know\nthe can was in the cooler.11\nOn December 30, 2006, Applicant stopped to visit a friend who lived near the\nborder before crossing into Canada. They had a meal, at which Applicant drank several\nbeers, but cannot recall how many. When crossing the border, Applicant was directed\nby Canadian authorities to pull his car over for inspection but failed to do so. He was\nstopped and arrested at 6:30 p.m. He told the arresting officer that he had consumed\none 12 ounce can of Budweiser beer at approximately 4:00 p.m. in a city about 120\nmiles south of the border. At 10:11 p.m., and again at 10:49 p.m., his BAC test results\nwere 110 and 120 mg/ml (equivalent to .110% and .120%), respectively. He was\ncharged with DUI, and released on foot on the U.S. side of the border. He walked to a\nlocal hotel, where he spent the night and recovered his car the following day. Due to\ntechnical flaws in the timing of the breath tests, Applicant\u2019s Canadian attorney\nconvinced the prosecutor not to file formal charges in the matter and he was not\nprosecuted.  \n12\nOn February 16, 2008, Applicant went on a lunchtime wine-tasting date. He does\nnot recall how much he drank. After he felt that he had waited long enough to safely\ndrive, he did so. At 9:24 p.m. he was on a highway and saw a disabled car stopped in\nhis lane ahead of him. Other cars ahead of him merged left and passed the car, but he\nwas unable to do so. He stopped just short of the disabled car. A local police officer who\nwas driving his police car behind Applicant was unable to stop and collided with the rear\nof Applicant\u2019s car. A state police trooper responded to the accident scene. He reported\ndetecting a moderate odor of alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath, and that Applicant\nperformed poorly on the field sobriety tests. Applicant provided two preliminary alcohol\nscreening device breath samples, both of which registered .068%. Applicant informed\nthe responding officer that he had taken a two-hour nap from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m., that his\n\nAR; GE 15; AE A; AE B; Tr. 28-33, 54-55, 63-81. I modified the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b to conform to the\n13\nfacts.\nAR; GE 15; Tr. 57-58, 62-63, 85-88. \n14\nGE 10.\n15\n5\nlast meal was a sausage and cheese sandwich with chips at noon, and that his drinking\nconsisted of one Budweiser beer that he drank at home beginning at 12:30 p.m. and\nending at 4:59 p.m. that afternoon. Applicant was arrested at 10:09 p.m., and taken to a\nhospital to provide a blood sample. The subsequent testing of this blood sample\nrevealed a blood alcohol content of .05. Under applicable state law, a reading greater\nthan .08 is an offense, while there is a presumption that one is not under the influence\nfor a reading of .05 or below. State law further provides a one-year statute of limitations\nwithin which misdemeanor charges must be formally filed, and that any misdemeanor\narrest that does not result in formal charges shall be considered only a detention, rather\nthan an arrest. Applicant was never charged in connection with this incident, and the\npolice report found the accident to have been the fault of the local police officer, not\nApplicant.    \n13\nApplicant admitted consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication or impairment, from approximately 1977 to at least February 16, 2008. He\ntestified that his last alcohol consumption was in June 2008, when he drank what he\nmistakenly believed to be a non-alcoholic beer at a party. He told an investigator during\nan August 2008 interview that he last drank when he had two beers at a party at a\nfriend\u2019s house. He was diagnosed as diabetic in February 2006, and said he did not\nconsume alcohol from then until December of that year, shortly before he was arrested\nwhile crossing into Canada. Applicant testified that he consumed no alcohol after that\nincident until the day of his February 2008 accident.   \n14\nIn preparation for his 2004 security clearance hearing, Applicant obtained an\nalcohol abuse evaluation from a clinical psychologist recommended by the attorney who\nrepresented him at that hearing. He met with this psychologist twice, on September 3,\nand 4, 2004. The psychologist found that Applicant\u2019s \u201chistory of substance use/abuse is\n\u2018within normal limits.\u2019\u201d He wrote, \u201cnegative experiences with alcohol have already led to\nchanges in his use patterns in that he no longer consumes alcohol away from home,\neven when dining out, because he does not wish to impair his judgment.\u201d He concluded\nthat he did not believe Applicant \u201cpossesses any more than the \u2018normal\u2019 risk for alcohol\nabuse and is at very little risk for alcohol dependence.\u201d Applicant did not receive any\ncounseling or other type of treatment from this psychologist.  \n15\nWhen completing his 2007 security clearance application, Applicant duly listed all\nof the foregoing arrests, including the 1998 DUI arrest that he omitted from his 1999\napplication as discussed above. He also listed his treatment in the alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram from August 2001 to February 2002. He did not list the 2004 consultation with\nthe clinical psychologist discussed in the preceding paragraph, however. He explained\nthat he failed to list that consultation because he did not receive any treatment, and the\n\nAR; GE 1; GE 11; Tr. 42-46, 60-61, 124. \n16\nAR; AE B; Tr. 49, 125-126.\n17\n6\nmatter had been fully disclosed during his previous security clearance hearing when he\nintroduced the evaluation report into evidence. Applicant\u2019s testimony on this point was\ncompletely credible. His explanation is understandable given the wording of the second\npart of the question asking the applicant to \u201cprovide the dates of treatment.\u201d There is no\nevidence from which it is reasonable to infer that this particular omission was a\ndeliberate falsification.   \n16\nApplicant denied the allegation, in SOR \u00b6 2.m, that he was cited and fined for\nspeeding on January 29, 2008, and testified that this did not happen. The extracts of his\nstate driving record contain no reference to any such incident. Department Counsel\nconceded that he had no evidence to prove the allegation, and was unaware of the\nbasis on which the drafter of the SOR included it.17\nApplicant submitted his performance evaluations for the past six years. His\noverall ratings reflect \u201cSuccessful Contributor\u201d for five of those years and \u201cHigh\nContributor\u201d for 2007. These evaluations further discussed his personal and technical\nstrengths and areas for development or improvement.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n7\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DCs supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by Department\nCounsel are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol treatment program.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents in 1998 and 2001 involved BAC readings of\n.24% and .191%, both of which indicate significant intoxication. A friend later claimed to\nhave been driving Applicant\u2019s car during the first incident, permitting him to avoid\ncriminal prosecution for DUI. He admitted driving during the second incident, after which\nhe completed a six-month alcohol treatment program for his diagnosed Alcohol Abuse.\nHe avoided further incidents prior to his 2004 security clearance hearing, and hired a\npsychologist who provided an evaluation opining that Applicant had learned from his\nearlier mistakes and future alcohol abuse was unlikely. Applicant claims to have\nseverely curtailed his alcohol consumption after his February 2006 diagnosis as a\ndiabetic. On December 29, 2006, he was cited for an open-container violation for which\nhe paid a fine rather than contest the ticket, despite his claim of ignorance that the beer\ncan was in his cooler. On December 30, 2006, he consumed what he told the arresting\nofficer was one beer several hours earlier, and what he testified during the hearing was\na few beers at a friend\u2019s house with dinner. He was sufficiently intoxicated while driving\nthrough the Canadian border control that he failed to comply with directions to pull over\nfor inspection, and was arrested. He had enough alcohol in his system to test at the\nequivalent of .11% three hours and forty-five minutes after his arrest, and .12% a half\nhour later. In February 2008, after an accident that was not his fault, his preliminary\nBAC tested at .68%, with a subsequent blood alcohol level tested at .05. This occurred\nat 9:24 p.m., after his consumption of what must have been a substantial amount of\nwine around seven to eight hours earlier on a lunchtime wine-tasting date. These facts\nclearly raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (f). He also admitted to\nconsuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication or impairment\nfrom 1977 to February 2008, supporting application of AG \u00b6 22(c).\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\n\n9\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has been involved in multiple alcohol-related incidents over the past 12\nyears, the most recent of which was about two years ago. None of these occurred under\nunusual circumstances. His clinical psychologist\u2019s 2004 opinion that he had learned\nfrom earlier mistakes, and such incidents were unlikely to recur, was disproved by his\nsubsequent conduct. He provided insufficient evidence to support such a conclusion at\nthis point. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation.\nApplicant says he has not consumed alcohol since June 2008, and consistently\nminimizes rather than acknowledges his issues of alcohol abuse. His 2006 and 2008\nalcohol-related incidents preclude a finding of a pattern of responsible use since his\n2001 treatment program. Insufficient time has passed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\n23(b), given the duration and nature of his history of alcohol abuse. Similarly, there is\nnot sufficient evidence to support mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and (d). Applicant had\nseveral relapses after his six-month alcohol treatment program, and demonstrated no\nparticipation in counseling or treatment since then. He provided no current favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or social worker. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes the DCs under this guideline. The specific Guideline E\nconcerns raised by the SOR allegation as asserted by Department Counsel are:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and\n(d) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\n\nasking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of an alcohol-related offense.\n18\nasking about any arrests or charges in the last 7 years not reported in response to questions 21 to 25.\n19\nGE 11 at 7.\n20\n10\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.  \nAlso raised are the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness issues the Appeal Board\nfound to be inherent under AG \u00b6 15. ISCR Case No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008).\nApplicant is an educated man with sufficient experience in the criminal justice\nsystem to have understood that he was charged with DUI in 1998, although that charge\nwas later dismissed. If he thought the dismissal of the charge eliminated his need to\ndisclose the incident in response to question 24  on his 1999 security clearance\n18\napplication, he should have reported the arrest in response to question 26  on that\n19\nform. His negative response to both of those questions together constituted a deliberate\nomission and concealment of relevant facts on that application, raising AG \u00b6 16(a). His\nomission of the psychologist\u2019s alcohol abuse evaluation from his 2007 questionnaire\nwas not a deliberate omission or concealment of that information. He received no\ntreatment in connection with those consultations, and the results were introduced as\nevidence on his behalf in his prior DOHA hearing.\nGuideline E has been revised since Applicant\u2019s last DOHA hearing, but Appeal\nBoard precedent (cited above) establishes that a pattern of behavior demonstrating\nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations will\nsupport security concerns under the guideline despite the language that would seem to\nlimit application of particular DCs to cases in which other guidelines are inapplicable.\nApplicant was denied a security clearance in 2005 due to the falsification noted above,\nand his pattern of unlawful behavior involving traffic violations. The previous judge\nnoted, \u201cApplicant engaged in numerous violations of the state traffic code. Many were\nsimilar or repeated violations, indicating a flagrant disregard for the law. . . . While any\none offense, standing alone, is relatively minor, the pattern of these offenses suggests\nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d  Since that decision, Applicant\n20\nwas cited and fined for three additional speeding violations, an open container violation,\nand committed at least one DUI (although Canadian authorities declined to prosecute).\nThis ongoing pattern supports continuing security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(d).\nThese acts adequately raise concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness,\nreliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and shift the burden to\nhim to establish mitigation. Additional whole-person analysis will be discussed in the\nfollowing section. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides personal conduct MCs. The only MCs with potential\napplicability to the foregoing security concerns are:\n\n11\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nMitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a) was not established because Applicant did not\ndisclose his 1998 arrest until confronted with information obtained by the investigator\nduring his subsequent interview. He offered no evidence that would support application\nof AG \u00b6 17(b). Partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c) was established, since the omission\nwas more than ten years ago, and he fully disclosed his criminal history on his 2007\napplication. Standing alone, this concealment in 1999 would not support current\nconcerns. However, considered in connection with his pattern of other violations, it\ncontinues to support some doubt about his trustworthiness and judgment. The only\ncounseling Applicant obtained was his 2001 and 2002 treatment for alcohol abuse, after\nwhich he resumed drinking and suffered multiple relapses. AG \u00b6 17(d) was not\nestablished. Applicant did not demonstrate positive steps to reduce or eliminate his\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) was therefore not\nestablished.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n12\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern spans the past twelve years. Multiple incidents similar to those that caused his\nclearance to be denied in 2005 occurred in the three years following that decision. This\ndemonstrates the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of irresponsible conduct and\nthe ongoing potential for exploitation or duress. Although the last incident alleged\nagainst Applicant took place two years ago, his repeated misconduct after losing his\nclearance for similar reasons demonstrates the absence of rehabilitation or other\npermanent behavioral changes. Applicant has been a well-educated, fully mature, and\naccountable adult throughout the period in question, and he voluntarily chose to engage\nin the conduct of concern. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a or 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d through 2.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.m:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

He held a security clearance from June 1985 to February 2002 while working for a different major defense contractor, and the clearance transferred with him when he changed jobs. He is single with no children. In his response to the SOR, he formally admitted the factual allegations set 2 forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, 2.d through 2.j, and 2.l, with some explanations. He denied the remaining SOR allegations, also with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his statements in response to DOHA interrogatories, are incorporated in the 3 following findings. DOHA issued a previous SOR to Applicant, which also cited security concerns under Guidelines G and E, on May 6, 2004. After a hearing, a different administrative 4 judge found for Applicant on the Guideline G allegations, because the alcohol-related incidents had occurred several years earlier, there was no indication of a recent problem, and Applicant had successfully completed an alcohol-rehabilitation program. However, the administrative judge found against Applicant on the Guideline E allegations, because his pattern of numerous violations of state traffic codes indicated a flagrant disregard for the law and suggested an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Furthermore, he concluded that Applicant deliberately omitted and concealed relevant and material facts concerning his October 1998 alcohol-related GE 11.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 24, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on September 30,\n2004.  On October 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nB and C for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 23, 2008.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 11, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on December 22, 2008, and I\nreceived the case assignment on January 5, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing\nthat same day, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 22, 2009.  The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.\n\n2\nApplicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR)\non February 3, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nFebruary 5, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On February 2, 2009, he submitted\nExhibit A, which the Government forwarded, without objection, on February 23, 2009.\nThe record closed on February 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Taiwan.  The request was granted.  The request, and the\nattached documents, were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in all the\nSubparagraphs of the SOR, with explanations, except for Subparagraph 2.c., which he\ndenied.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1975, initially immigrated to the U.S. in\n1995, but continued his schooling, college, in Taiwan until 2000 (TR at page 17 line 23\nto page 21 line 3, and GX 1 at page 1).  After college, he returned to the U.S. to pursue\nhis Masters Degree in 2000 (Id).  His net worth in the U.S. is at least $750,000, and his\nsalary is about $80,000 (TR at page 24 line 3 to page 25 line 10, and at page 28 lines\n5~10, see also AppX A at pages 22~34).\n1.a.  The Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens of Taiwan (GX 1 at page 3).  The\nApplicant\u2019s father is involved in financial planning, and lives six months out of the year in\nTaiwan and the other six months in the U.S. (TR at page 29 line 24 to page 32 line 12).\nHis father has no connection with the Taiwanese government (Id).\nThe Applicant\u2019s mother is a retired accountant, who lives with the Applicant\u2019s\nsister in the U.S. (TR at page 32 line 21 to page 33 line 19).  His mother also has no\nconnection with the Taiwanese government (Id).\n1.b.  The Applicant\u2019s sister, a dual national with Taiwan, works for a city\u2019s\ngovernment in the U.S. (TR at page 35 lines 4~19).\n1.c. and 1.d.  Through the Applicant\u2019s mother, who uses his name, the Applicant\nowns about $87,000 of stock in Taiwanese companies, and has about $10,000 in a\n\n3\nTaiwanese bank account (TR at page 36 line 3 to page 38 line 6, and at page 38 line 7\nto page 39 line 19).  Although these accounts are in the Applicant\u2019s name, he avers that\nhe has little access to them, and his mother represents that she will \u201ccooperate with . . .\n[her] son to transfer . . . [her] money out of his accounts in Taiwan and transfer the\nmoney to the U.S.\u201d (AppX A the last page).\n1.e.  The Applicant avers that he has transferred Taiwanese real estate, worth\nabout $128,500, to his father (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 41 line 6).  However,\ndespite his representation at his hearing, he has provided no documentation in support\nof this averment.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n2.a. and 2.b.  After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2001, the Applicant\ntraveled to Taiwan on five separate occasions, from 2004~2007, using his Taiwanese\npassport (TR at page 43 line 4 to page 48 line 8, and GX 2).  He renewed that passport\nin December of 2005 (TR at page 48 line 9 to page 49 line 23, and GX 3).\n2.c.  The Applicant has returned his passport to the Taiwanese \u201cBureau of\nCounselor Affairs\u201d (TR at page 49 line 24 to page 51 line 15).\n2.d.  Having lived \u201ctwo-thirds\u201d of his life in Taiwan, the Applicant is unwilling to\nrenounce his Taiwanese citizenship (TR at page 52 lines 13~17, at page 54 line 25 to\npage 57 line 1, and at page 57 line 13 to page 59 line 5).  He reiterated this stance\nseveral times during his testimony, and in his response to the SOR (Id).\nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Taiwan has an elected\ndemocratic government.  It has the 17  largest economy in the world and is a leading\nth\nproducer of high-technology goods.  It engages in industrial and economic espionage.\nProprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information\nto be acquired by their agents from foreign governments and business.  Although the\nU.S. now recognizes Taiwan as part of \u201cone-China,\u201d it continues to maintain strong\nunofficial relations with Taiwan.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Subparagraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . .\n. who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\n\n5\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s parent\u2019s are Taiwanese Nationals, and his father resides half the year in\nTaiwan.  This is countered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of\nthe relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . .\n. are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s parents have no connection with the Taiwanese government, his mother\nresides in the U.S., as does his father for half of the year.\nHowever, the disqualifying condition noted in Subparagraph 7(e) is also\napplicable: \u201ca substantial . . . financial or property interest in a foreign country, . . .which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d\nDespite his mother\u2019s representation to \u201ccooperate with . . . [her] son,\u201d he still owns\n$87,000 in Taiwanese stock, has $10,000 in a Taiwanese bank account, and has failed\nto demonstrate he has transferred his $128,500 in real estate to his father.  I can find no\ncountervailing mitigating condition.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nParagraph 9 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Preference: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d\nHere, Subparagraph 10(a)(1) and (5) are applicable. \u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of a foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport; . . . (5) using foreign citizenship to protect\nfinancial or business interests in another country.\u201d  Although mitigating condition\nParagraph 11(e) is applicable, as the Applicant\u2019s \u201cpassport has been . . . surrendered to\nthe cognizant security authority,\u201d I can not find that crucial provisions of Paragraph 11(b)\nare also applicable.  In answer to the SOR, and at his hearing, the Applicant repeatedly\nfailed to express \u201ca willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  He wishes to retain his\nTaiwanese citizenship to maintain a connection with the country where he spent two-\nthirds of his life, and to protect what financial interests he may have in Taiwan.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\n\n6\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHe has the support of his Product Manager, who has known the Applicant for two\nyears (AppX A at page 21).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant not mitigated the trustworthiness\nconcerns arising from his Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\n\nTranscript at 6-8.\n1\n2\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On June 27, 2006,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 24, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge erred by concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised under Guidelines F\nand E had not been mitigated.\n(1) On appeal, Applicant argues that she did not understand most of the verbiage used by the\nJudge and Department Counsel at the hearing, and that she wasn\u2019t really able to present her case well\nbecause of a medical disability.  In support of this argument, she states that she was diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder in 2006, she has been hospitalized a number of times because of her mental\ncondition, she is currently on medication, and she is seeing a psychiatrist on a monthly basis.  The\nBoard construes Applicant\u2019s argument as raising the issue of whether she received due process. \nAfter reviewing the record in this case, the Board concludes that Applicant was reasonably\nprovided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that\nthe Judge conducted the hearing in a professional manner, consistent with her role as an impartial\npresiding official.  At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge diligently inquired into Applicant\u2019s\nunderstanding of her right to retain an attorney, and her willingness and ability to represent herself.\nShe gave Applicant a detailed overview of the process and told her: \u201cIf at any point you\u2019re confused\nabout any terms or words used during the proceedings, or about any procedural aspect of the\nproceeding, please let me know and I will try to answer any questions that you may have.\u201d   Based\n1\nupon the representations she received from the Applicant, she reasonably concluded that Applicant\nwas making a knowing and intelligent waiver of her right to counsel, and was ready and willing to\nproceed with the hearing. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. July 24, 2006);\nCompare ICR Case No. 04-12732 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006).  During the hearing, Applicant gave\nreasonably detailed explanations as to her financial and medical circumstances, appeared to\nunderstand what was transpiring, answered questions appropriately, and did not otherwise impose\nany objections to the proceedings.  Although Applicant states on appeal that she was confused by\nthe legal language used at the hearing, the transcript appears to contain very little specialized\nlanguage or jargon.\nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that\nfailure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6\n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2001).  Because Applicant did not object to proceeding or otherwise request a\ncontinuance of her case, she was not denied due process under the Directive or Executive Order.  \n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns\n\nIn her brief, Applicant also makes statements as to her ongoing efforts to resolve her financial problems.  The\n2\nBoard may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Accordingly, we may not consider\nApplicant\u2019s additional explanations, and they do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\n3\nraised under Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated, in that she gave insufficient weight to the\nfavorable evidence in the record, particularly Applicant\u2019s outstanding job performance.    Applicant\u2019s\n2\nargument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. June 6, 2007).  Trustworthiness determinations are not\nlimited to consideration of an applicant's job performance or conduct during duty hours, and off-duty\nconduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's trustworthiness eligibility. See, e.g., ADP Case\nNo. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance\nmay engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-\n09293 at 2 (App. Bd. June 6, 2007).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of\noff-duty conduct and circumstances which are of trustworthiness concern to the government and\nmandate a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-\nperson analysis is not confined to the workplace.  Id.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  She reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  Given the record that was before her, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe determination of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems\nin ADP I/II/II sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

She has provided proof of payment of eight medical collection accounts which were not\nalleged in the SOR. She has taken no steps to resolve the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.\nShe deliberately failed to list her delinquent debts on her trustworthiness application. She failed to\nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal conduct.\nApplicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn January 3, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP\nI/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\").  On June 27, 2006, DOHA\n1\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which\nis in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\nIn a sworn statement dated September 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2006.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on November 3, 2006, scheduling the hearing for November 29, 2006. The hearing was\nconducted on that date. The government submitted Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1- 4 which were\nadmitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted no\nexhibits. The record was held open until December 13, 2006, to allow Applicant to submit further\ndocuments. An additional extension was granted until December 27, 2006. A nine page document\nwas timely submitted and marked as AE A, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations under Guideline F and\ndenies the allegation under Guideline E. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 29 year old woman employed as a benefit service representative for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust.

She has not filed for a child support order because she prefers\nthat he just stay away based on his abusive nature.   \n6\nIn January 1999, Applicant was seriously injured in a car accident.  She was unable to work\nfor six months and got behind on her bills. She also incurred several medical debts as a result of her\ninjury.  \n7\nShe married her current husband in 2001. He works full-time for a federal government\nagency.   He provides support.   \n8\n9\nOn January 3, 2005, Applicant was hired by her current employer.  On that same date, she\ncompleted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P).  She answered \"No\" in response to\n10\nquestion 20.

After monthly\n32\nexpenses, she and her husband had $539 remaining each month.33\nNone of the debts alleged in the SOR were paid or resolved at the time of the hearing.\nApplicant has paid approximately 13 medical accounts which were not alleged in the SOR.  After\n34\nthe hearing, she submitted proof that eight medical collection accounts were paid off.  The\n35\ndocuments do not indicate the amount of each debt and when the accounts were paid.\nIn 1999/2000, Applicant consulted a credit counselor.  She was advised that they needed\nmore information from her.  She never went back.  Since that time, she made no attempts to seek\ncredit counseling.36\nSeveral items have changed on her May 2005 Personal Financial Statement.  Her husband's\nmonthly income increased from $3,000 a month to $3,800 a month.  Her income has decreased\nslightly since she reduced her work day from eight hours to six hours.  In March 2006, they bought\na home.  Their mortgage payment is $2,000 a month.  Applicant's husband and mother-in-law own\nthe home. They would not have qualified for a loan if Applicant's name was on the mortgage due to\nher poor credit history.   They currently have a little over $300 each month after expenses.

She and her husband still owe\n38\napproximately $700 in state income taxes for tax year 2005.39\nApplicant intends to pay her debts.  She has no definite plan in place for resolving her\n40\ndelinquent accounts. At hearing, she mentioned paying off the debt by refinancing their home\nmortgage.  She is currently unable to pay her delinquent debts and may now consider bankruptcy\n41\nas an option.42\nApplicant explained that she did not list her delinquent debts in response to question 20 on\nthe public trust application because she hurried through the application.  Under cross examination,\n43\nshe admitted to being aware that she had several delinquent debts at the time she filled out the\napplication.  In an affidavit, dated May 25, 2005, Applicant acknowledges that she encountered\n44\nfinancial problems since 1999 and describes her delinquent accounts in detail. She explained that\nmost of her accounts became delinquent after her 1999 car accident.  Based on her numerous\n45\ndelinquent accounts and her admission that she was aware that she had delinquent debts, I find that\nshe intentionally withheld information about her delinquent debts in response to question 20 on her\npublic trust application signed by her on January 3, 2005. Contrary to her assertions, the evidence\nindicates that she was aware of her financial situation when she filled out her public trust application.\nShe provided no documentation pertaining to her work performance.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n46\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n47\n Id.\n48\n Id.\n49\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n50\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n51\n8\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information. \nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n47\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n48\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n49\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n50\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n51\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n53\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,\nand Guideline E - Personal Conduct. \nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case. Between 1999 and November 2004, she\nincurred 18 delinquent accounts that were turned over for collection or charged off. Currently, she\nhas 18 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $23,281.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant's\ndelinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior\nwas not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated) because she still carries a\nsignificant amount of delinquent debt.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation)) applies, in part. In 1999, Applicant was seriously injured in an\nautomobile accident which resulted in her being unable to work for six months. She accumulated\nseveral delinquent debts and some medical bills as a result.  In addition, her relationship with the\nfather of her two oldest children ended.  He has not provided child support for his two children. These\nare some contributing factors to Applicant's financial problems. However, ten of her 18 delinquent\ndelinquent accounts occurred several years after her accident.  It appears that her financial situation\n54\nimproved after marrying her current husband in 2001. However, several debts became delinquent after\nher marriage. Although MC 3 applies which explains the cause of the debt, an applicant's actions\ntowards resolving the debt should be considered as well.  It has been over seven years since her\naccident.  Applicant has paid some medical accounts but made no attempts to pay her other delinquent\naccounts. For this reason, I give MC 3 less weight.  \nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply.\n\n10\nApplicant consulted a credit counselor around 1999/2000.  The credit counselor requested more paper\nwork. Applicant did not return to the credit counselor. Although she has paid several medical bills,\nall of her other debts remain unresolved.  It is unlikely her financial problems will be resolved in the\nnear future. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations\nconcern.  It might be helpful for Applicant to seek out some sort of financial counseling in order to\nlearn about budgeting and how to deal with her delinquent debt. At this point it is premature to apply\nMC 4.\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Although the Applicant paid some medical bills that were\nnot alleged in the SOR. None of the debts in the SOR have been resolved.  She took no steps to repay\nher overdue creditors even though she indicated her intent to do so in her May 2005 statement. I\ncannot conclude that she made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts.\nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline\nF is decided against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies.  Although Applicant claims that she did\nnot deliberately withhold her delinquent debts in response to question 20 on the trustworthiness\napplication, her explanation that she hurried when filling out the application is not sufficient to justify\nthe omission of her delinquent debts.  When she signed the application, she certified that her answers\nwere \"true, complete, and correct to best of her knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.\" She\nadmitted at hearing that she was aware that she had delinquent debts at the time she filled out her\ntrustworthiness application. The government expects applicants for trustworthiness determinations\nto tell the truth at all times. Considering the extent of her delinquent debt, I find she deliberately did\nnot list them on her trustworthiness application. \nI find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under personal conduct. Guideline E is\ndecided against Applicant. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\n\n11\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that\nhas negative trustworthiness implications. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness position\nbased on her deliberate failure to disclose her delinquent debts and her lack of action towards\nresolving her delinquent accounts. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is\ndenied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January\n24, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guidelines E and J had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines E and J had not been mitigated, in that he gave insufficient weight to the fact that\nApplicant had served honorably and faithfully in the Navy for 26 years; he had served honorably as\na police officer for 21 years; and he had held a security clearance of 23 years.  Applicant\u2019s argument\ndoes not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).\nThe Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case\nNo. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 1992).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant\nactually mishandles or fails to properly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke\naccess to such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert.\ndenied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage\nin conduct that has negative security implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and\ncircumstances which are of trustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole person\nanalysis to determine an applicant's security clearance eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not\nconfined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (June 4, 2004).\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v.

Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

During a one week period early in January/February 2001, he consumed beer and/or vodka daily to intoxication. This alcohol binge was caused by stress that had been building up for quite a while. The stress was caused by three things: his job as a police officer, marital problems, and financial difficulties. At the end of the week he realized he was destroying his life and spoke to a friend about it. The friend advised him to get help, and applicant listened to the advice. He first went to his medical doctor, and after he told the doctor what was happening, the doctor prescribed him medication for depression and to help him sleep. Applicant then decided on his own to go to an alcohol rehabilitation program. The director of the program suggested he attend group therapy. He attended a couple of group therapy sessions, but decided it wasn\u2019t working for him and stopped going. He then attended a few AA meetings. After attending these meetings for about a month, he stopped going because he wasn\u2019t getting anything out of them. About the same time he met with the police department\u2019s psychologist.

He remained a moderate drinker until\n2001. During a one week period early in January/February 2001, he consumed beer and/or vodka\ndaily to intoxication. This alcohol binge was caused by stress that had been building up for quite a\nwhile. The stress was caused by three things: his job as a police officer, marital problems, and\nfinancial difficulties. At the end of the week he realized he was destroying his life and spoke to a\nfriend about it. The friend advised him to get help, and applicant listened to the advice. He first went\nto his medical doctor, and after he told the doctor what was happening, the doctor prescribed him\nmedication for depression and to help him sleep. Applicant then decided on his own to go to an\nalcohol rehabilitation program. The director of the program suggested he attend group therapy. He\nattended a couple of group therapy sessions, but decided it wasn\u2019t working for him and stopped\ngoing. He then attended a few AA meetings. After attending these meetings for about a month, he\nstopped going because he wasn\u2019t getting anything out of them. About the same time he met with the\npolice department\u2019s psychologist. Applicant told the psychologist that he thought he was an alcoholic\nand informed him he had gone to his medical doctor and was placed on medication for depression\nand insomnia. He also told the psychologist what had been going on in his life. According to\napplicant, the psychologist then told him that his problem was depression and not alcohol. From the\ntime his week-long binge ended until May or June 2001, applicant abstained from the use of alcohol.\nHe currently consumes one to four beers a day. Applicant testified that he \u201cwould venture to say, and\n[he] could be wrong, that [he last consumed alcohol to intoxication] when [he] got the [SOR]\u201d (TR\nat 17).\n\n3\nIn March 2004, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence-\nAlcohol (DUI), (2) Failure to Maintain Proper Travel Lane, (3) Open Container, and (4) Failure to\nChange Address on Driver\u2019s License. He pleaded guilty to the second charge, and was fined $263.00.\nThe other charges were dismissed. Although applicant consumed about four beer throughout the day,\nhe denies he was under the influence of alcohol when he was arrested.\nApplicant completed and executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) in September\n2004 (Exhibit 1). In response to Question 24, which asked, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offenses(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d applicant stated \u201cno.\u201d This response was\nfalse because, as noted above, he had been arrested for, and charged with, DUI less than a year\nearlier. Applicant testified that he answered \u201cno\u201d because he must have \u201ckeyed on the word\nconvicted\u201d (TR at 46).\nIn response to Question 26, which asked if in the previous seven years he had been  arrested\nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offenses he did not previously disclose on the SCA, applicant\nstated \u201cno.\u201d When asked why, in light of his DUI arrest, he didn\u2019t respond \u201cyes\u201d to this question,\napplicant testified that \u201cagain [he] was thinking conviction\u201d (TR at 47).\nIn response to Question 30 which asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years has your use of alcoholic\nbeverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such\nas for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\u201d applicant stated \u201cno.\u201d This response was also false because,\nas noted above, applicant had attended group therapy sessions at an alcohol rehabilitation program\nin 2001. Applicant first testified that he has no explanation for his false response (TR at 40). He then\noffered a few possible explanations. He testified (1) in essence, that his counseling was\npsychological, and not alcohol-related, (2)  he was embarrassed about the alcohol counseling and\nwas afraid somebody at his office might see his response, and (3) he did not read the question\nthoroughly (TR 39, 40-41).\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his false responses to all three questions were not credible. I find\nthat he intentionally provided the false information in an attempt to conceal his alcohol-related\nproblems from the Government.\nTwo of applicant\u2019s coworkers, including his supervisor, appeared at the hearing an testified\nthat applicant is reliable and trustworthy.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith respect to Guideline G, the evidence establishes that during a one week period in early\n2001, applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication daily. This conduct reflects adversely\non his judgment and reliability, and requires application of Disqualifying Condition E2.A7.1.2.5\n(habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment).\nThere is no hard, credible evidence that applicant has consumed alcohol to intoxication since\n\nApplicant\u2019s equivocal statement concerning his alcohol consumption when he received\n1\nthe SOR is insufficient to establish he drank to intoxication.\n See, Guideline G, E2.A7.1.2.6.\n2\n4\nthe 2001 week-long binge.  Accordingly, he qualifies for Mitigating Condition E2.A7.1.3.2 (the\n1\nproblem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem). The fact\nhe continues to consume alcohol is not a disqualifying condition because he has never been\ndiagnosed with alcoholism.  Based on the passage of time since applicant last abused alcohol (over\n2\nfive years), Guideline G is found for him.\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that applicant intentionally provided\nfalse information to the Government when he completed the SCA in 2004. This conduct is extremely\ntroubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access\nto our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on a security\nclearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the\ngood judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders. Applicant\u2019s intentional\nfalsifications require application of Disqualifying Condition  E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire  . . .). No Mitigating Conditions are applicable. Based on the foregoing, Guideline E\nis found against applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications are also cognizable under Guideline J as they constitute felonies\nunder 18 U.S.C. 1001.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: FOR THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: AGAINST  THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 3: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1  \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\n \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified,\nand revised.  The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on September 15, 2006, and elected to have a hearing.  The case was assigned to me\non October 16, 2006.  The Notice of Hearing was issued on November 9, 2006.  I convened a hearing\non December 21, 2006.  The government offered three exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-3.  Applicant\noffered  no exhibits.  I kept the record open until January 12, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to\nfile additional documents.  He filed nothing.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January\n4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.f.,\n1.g., 1.m., 1.o., 1.p., 2.a., and 2.b.  He denied the allegations in subparagraphs 1.d., 1.e., 1.h., 1.i.,\n1.j., 1.k., and 1.l.  Through a scrivener\u2019s error, the SOR contained no subparagraph 1.n.  The\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following  findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 47-year-old communications analyst employed by a defense contractor.   He\n2\nis divorced and has two children, both of whom are emancipated.   He is a high school graduate with\n3\nalmost enough college credits for an associate's degree.   He is a retired veteran of the United States\n4\nNavy, serving from March 1980 to March 2003.   He retired with the rank of  Chief Petty Officer,\n5\nand he has held a security clearance since 1980.  \n6\nFinancial Considerations\nAs of May 3, 2006, Applicant owed the following:\n\nId. at 16.\n7\nId.; Applicant provided no proof of payment.\n8\nId. at 17.\n9\nId. at 18; Applicant claimed it was his wife\u2019s debt, but failed to provide copies of his divorce papers to confirm.\n10\nId. at 23; Applicant claimed he was current with his payments, but provided no proof.\n11\nId.; Applicant claimed he made payment arrangements, but provided no evidence thereof.\n12\nId.; Applicant claimed he made payment arrangements, but provided no evidence thereof.\n13\nId. at 24; Applicant thought it might be his ex-wife\u2019s debt, but was unsure, and he provided no further evidence.\n14\nId. at 26; Applicant claimed this was a duplicate of SOR 1.b., but provided no evidence.\n15\nId.; Applicant claimed it was his wife\u2019s debt, but failed to provide copies of his divorce papers to confirm.\n16\nId. at 27; Applicant claimed it was his wife\u2019s debt, but failed to provide copies of his divorce papers to confirm.\n17\nId; Copy of money order payment attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.\n18\nId. at 28; Applicant claimed he made payment arrangements, but provided no evidence thereof.\n19\n4\nSOR \u00b6\nDebt\nAmount\nCurrent Status\n1.a.\nCredit card\n$1,146\nUnpaid7\n1.b.\nUtilities\n$258\nUnpaid8\n1.c.\nCredit card\n$1,015\nUnpaid9\n1.d.\nCredit card\n$7,742\nUnpaid10\n1.e.\nCharged off; repossession\n$18,000\nUnpaid11\n1.f.\nCredit card\n$639\nUnpaid12\n1.g.\nCredit card\n$718\nUnpaid13\n1.h.\nUnknown\n$1,009\nUnpaid14\n1.i.\nDuplicate of 1.b.\n$258\nUnpaid15\n1.j.\nCredit card\n$2,158\nUnpaid16\n1.k.\nCredit card\n$1,942\nUnpaid17\n1.l.\nCable TV\n$81\nPaid18\n1.m.\nCredit card\n$829\nUnpaid19\n\nId.

The current status notes in the above table that are in bold indicate that\nApplicant either claimed they were paid, were his ex-wife\u2019s debts, or that he had made payment\narrangements.  The only debt for which he provided proof of payment was for an $81 cable TV bill.\nIn 19998, Applicant deployed overseas.  Shortly thereafter, he and his wife separated, and\nshe returned to the U.S.  His financial problems commenced during this time with the added costs\nof maintaining two households until they were divorced in March 2002.   He paid $1,271 per month\n22\nin temporary maintenance and child support until May 2000, then $800 per month until the divorce.\nHe paid $400 per month child support from September 2002 until October 2003, when his son turned\n18.   His wife returned to court and he was ordered to pay an additional year of child support,\n23\nbecause the state law required support until the child turned 19.   He pays no support now as his\n24\nchild is emancipated,  but he pays tuition for his son\u2019s college expenses.   His son has had student\n25\n26\nloans available that helped keep his costs down.   He helps his daughter with her finances as he is\n27\nable, because she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2003.   She draws disability payments.\n28\n29\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant falsified material facts on a security clearance application, dated March 30, 2005.30\nIn response to the following, Question 38.  Your financial delinquencies - 180 days  In the last 7\n\nId. \n31\nId. \n32\nTr.  at 29.\n33\nId. at 29, 32.\n34\nGuidelines \u00b6 2. \n35\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n36\n6\nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He did not\nspecify the debts listed in the above table.31\nIn response to the following, Question 39.  Your financial delinquencies - 90 days  Are\nyou currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?, he answered \u201cNo,\u201d knowing that he had the\ndebts listed in the above table.32\nApplicant stated that he did not answer affirmatively because he was told that unless he could\nlist the company name, amount of the original debt, and what was due, he should not list it on the\nSF 86.   When asked who had told him that, he replied: \n33\nI was at the naval base filling out my SF 86, and so I went to the HR people there and\nthat\u2019s what they advised me to do.  After I prepared my SF 86, then I mailed it to my\nsecurity manager, and I had informed him at that time about the debt portion of it and\nnot putting in dates and creditors because I didn\u2019t have all that information with me.\nAnd my intention was not to falsify that document or be misleading on it, because I\nknow that during the background investigation, I know the one thing that they\u2019re\ngoing to do is pull a credit bureau report.34\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each Guidelines, the Guidelines are\ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.   An administrative judge\u2019s over-\n35\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process\nis a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an\nadministrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.36\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n37\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n38\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n39\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n7\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n37\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n38\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.39\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the Guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n40\n8\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n40\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in payments on numerous\naccounts.  \nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The\nDirective sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation).  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts started accumulating during his overseas assignment and\nseparation from his wife.  He was divorced in March 2002.  These events were beyond his control.\nThis mitigating condition applies.  \nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply as\nthere is no evidence that Applicant sought financial counseling.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve bad debts) is not applicable.  Applicant claimed he had paid a few debts and\nhad made arrangement with other creditors to make payments.  He also alleged that several debts\nwere his ex-wife\u2019s.  He was given three weeks after the hearing to provide evidence of payments,\narrangements, divorce papers, cancelled checks, or other evidence of efforts to resolve debts.  He\nfiled nothing.  Almost five years have passed since his divorce, and the only debt for which he had\nproof of payment was one for $81.  There is no evidence as to why he could pay nothing since his\ndivorce.  Supporting his son is not an unforeseen event.  While I empathize with his daughter\u2019s\nmedical disability, he does not have a legal obligation to support her.  He does have legal obligations\nto pay his debts.  There is virtually no evidence to corroborate his testimony about the payments he\nmade or the debts that may have been set apart to his former spouse.  Absent this evidence I cannot\nfind that this mitigating condition applies.  He has shown no genuine effort to reduce his delinquent\ndebts.  I conclude Guideline F against  Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n41\nId.\n42\nId.\n43\n9\nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)\napplies.  Applicant did not list any of his delinquent debts on two questions on his SF 86.  He\nclaimed he was told not to list anything if he could not list the name of the creditor company, amount\nof the debt, and the amount remaining to be paid.  Applicant was a Chief Petty Officer in the Navy.\nHe knew or should have known what was required on an SF 86.  He was given an opportunity to\nprovide evidence of the claims of debts resolution that he testified that he had made.  He provided\nnothing.  Applicant\u2019s reasons for the falsification were not credible.  His testimony was not credible\nbecause when asked and given the opportunity to clarify the record, he produced nothing.   \nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC)  E2.A5.1.3.2. (The falsification was an\nisolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information\nvoluntarily) does not apply.  The SF 86 was signed on March 30, 2005.  It was recent, he did not\nprovide correct information when given an opportunity to clarify the record, and his testimony\u2019s\ncredibility was undermined by his failure to provide evidence. \nAlso inapplicable is PC MC E2.A5.1.3.4. (Omission of material facts was caused or\nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the\npreviously omitted information was promptly and fully provided.)  Applicant was a Chief Petty\nOfficer in the Navy.  He knew what was right.  I do not believe his excuses for lying on his security\nclearance.  I find his omissions were deliberate.  I base my conclusion on the fact that his testimony\nlacks credibility.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n41\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\n42\nI also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.   I considered his age (47), his education, his naval career, the\n43\ncauses of his financial problems, and the reasons he gave for making false answers on his security\nclearance application.  Applicant made no progress in reducing his debt.  His proof of paying only\n.0022 (11/5000) of the debts listed in the SOR is not a good-faith effort at debt resolution.\nApplicant\u2019s two false answers on his security clearance application are  problematic because candor\nwith the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a security suitability determination.\nIf a person discloses the adverse information about himself, then he may be trusted with classified\ninformation.  Here, Applicant listed no debts.  Further, even though he testified about making\npayment arrangements, or making payments, or claiming that some debts were his ex-wife\u2019s, when\n\nThrough a scrivener\u2019s error, there is no subparagraph 1.n.\n44\n10\ngiven the time to corroborate his testimony with written evidence, he produced nothing.  The totality\nof the record  raises continuing doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and\nto exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Those favorable\n1\nfindings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided upon the written record.  On March 15, 2007, after considering\nthe record, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that: (a) Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstances beyond her control\u2014a prolonged period of\nunemployment; (b) Applicant had been making payments on some of her outstanding debts; (c) she\nhad excellent performance reviews from her employer; (d) she had not engaged in any illegal\nactivity; and (e) Applicant\u2019s debts could not be used against her.  In support of her argument,\nApplicant provides an updated version of her response to the government\u2019s file of relevant material,\nwhich provides additional explanations about her financial situation, including her efforts to resolve\nsome of her debts subsequent to the close of the record in this case.  Much of Applicant\u2019s submission\nin this regard relates to debts cited in SOR paragraphs which were resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor and\nare not at issue on appeal.  With respect to the balance of Applicant\u2019s submission, her arguments do\nnot demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).\nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security\nimplications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\nsecurity concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's\nsecurity eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No.\n03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR\n\n3\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had delinquent debts and was still\nin the process of resolving her financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep.\n28, 2006).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 46-year-old pipe fitter, who has worked for a federal contractor for the last 28\nyears. From 1998 to March 2006, Applicant accumulated a significant amount of debt that he\nresolved through three bankruptcies, two Chapter 7 bankruptcies and one Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nSince March 2006, he has begun to demonstrate some financial responsibility. However, he did not\nmitigate the security concerns raised by financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 27, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2. (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 20, 2006, detailing the basis\nfor its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 19, 2007, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 28. 2007.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 16, 2007, setting the case for April 5, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1\u20132 into evidence\nwithout objections. Applicant testified in his case and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A\u2013B into\nevidence without objections. The record was left open until April 15, 2007, to give Applicant\nadditional time to submit documents. By agreement, that date was extended to April 20, 2007.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 16, 2007. I received additional documents from\nApplicant on April 19, 2007, that I marked AX C. Department Counsel had no objection to the\ndocuments and they were admitted into the record on said date.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old pipe fitter for a federal contractor. He is single and has a 28 year\nold son. He has worked for his current employer since June 1979 (GX 1). He has received good\nevaluations over the years. (Tr. 21) He has held a secret security clearance since 1980 (GX 1 at 5).\nHe has access to classified information and has never been charged with mishandling it (Tr. 21) He\nbelieves this is the second time he has gone through the SCA renewal process (Tr. 29).\nParagraph 1 of the SOR alleges security concerns under the financial guidelines. Applicant\nadmitted that he filed bankruptcy three times. In October 1998, he petitioned for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, having accumulated approximately $101,280 in liabilities. The Chapter 13 was\nconverted into a Chapter 7 and the debts were discharged in May 1999 (AX A; Tr. 32). Some of the\n\n3\ndebts arose because he was unemployed for a period time while his company was on strike. Others\nwere related to his elderly mother\u2019s medical condition. He also acknowledged that he purchased\nmany items that he could not afford, including a $30,000 corvette and a pick-up truck (Tr. 22-23).\nIn September 2000, Applicant filed his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. After he\ncompleted making payments through a wage earner plan with the bankruptcy court, the court\ndischarged approximately $46,066 of his debts in April 2004 (Tr. 32-34).\nIn October 2004, Applicant filed his third Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. That petition was\nconverted into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2005 with liabilities of $41,878.36 (Tr. 35). His\nChapter 13 petition with $38,556.36 in liabilities was dismissed in July 2005.  He had again accrued\nnumerous debts related to his indiscriminate spending habits (Tr. 45). In March 2006, the court\ndischarged the $41,878 of debts, which included all of the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e\u20131.l (Tr. 54; 58).\nThose debts consisted of car and furniture repositions, a car loan that he co-signed for his son, and\nother loans. The two wage garnishments noted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n were also included in the\ndischarge (Tr. 34-38 ). He believes the creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l represent the same debt\n(Tr. 57). A November 2006 credit report continues to document many of the debts alleged in the\nSOR and his over-all financial history (GX 2). He claims they should have been removed from his\ncredit report after the last bankruptcy (Tr. 37). He has not taken any action to have his credit report\ncorrected.\nApplicant currently lives with his 88 year old mother (Tr. 40). His net monthly income is\n$2,976 and his housing expenses are approximately $982 (AX C at 7). He also makes a car and\nmotorcycle payment that total approximately $1,055 per month, in addition to repaying a $3,000 loan\nhe took out against his 401(k) (Tr. 42). He does not have any credit cards and believes he is living\nwithin his financial means because he supplements his income with $500 in overtime each month\n(Tr. 44). Since the last bankruptcy discharge in 2006, he has become more financially responsible\n(Tr. 59). He does not spend more than he earns (Tr. 46). He is very aware of the consequences that\nhis financial history could have on his employment (AX C at 4).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . .  that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at\n527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\n\n4\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern under Guideline F is that the failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and a November 2006 credit report, the Government\nestablished a disqualification under Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations). Applicant has been unable to manage his debts from approximately 1998 to March\n2006, when he discharged a large amount of debt, for the second time, through bankruptcy because\nhe was unable to pay his bills.\nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. Six conditions can mitigate security concerns arising from financial\ndifficulties. After reviewing all of them, I conclude he presented some evidence to establish two of\nthem.\n(1) Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a) the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment does\nnot apply because Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing from 1998 until March 2006, and do cast\ndoubt on his judgment and reliability.\n(2) FC MC 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\noffers limited mitigation in view of Applicant\u2019s unemployement for a period of time and sick\nmother. However, there is no evidence that he acted responsibly in handling the problems at the time\nthey occurred as required under this condition. \n3) FC MC 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control cannot apply\nbecause Applicant acknowledged that he has not obtained credit counseling, and the budget he\n\n5\nsubmitted after the hearing does not contain all of his expenses or income, namely those that he\ndisclosed during the hearing relating to his vehicle loans and overtime. Thus, there is no solid\nevidence that his problems are under control. \n(4) There is some evidence to support the establishment of FC MC 20(d) the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts because he repaid\n$46,006 of debt through a bankruptcy repayment schedule. \n(5) Based on his acknowledgment of all of the debts and the absence of documentation\nindicating that he disputed any debt, FC MC 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue cannot\nbe applied. \n(6) FC MC 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income is not applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is known as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Directive \u00b6 E2.2. In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative judge\nshould consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, the fact that he has held a security clearance for more than twenty years, his\ndemeanor while testifying, and candid disclosure about his history of financial problems. I also\nconsidered that over the course of time he failed to pay some of the smaller debts included in the last\nbankruptcy, for example, $71 noted in SOR \u00b6 1.f and $86 noted in SOR \u00b6 1.k. While he stated he has\nbeen managing his money responsibly since March 2006, one year of financial responsibility does\nnot mitigate approximately $150,000 of discharged debts in less than ten years and his current tight\nbudget. Although he expressed a willingness to continue living within his financial means, he has\nnot established a solid budget that would assure the Government that he will not incur similar\nfinancial problems in the future. Given his current awareness of the effect that his financial situation\nhas on his employment, I believe he will initiate further steps to manage his financial obligations and\ndemonstrate good judgment. However, at this time all allegations under Paragraph 1 of the SOR are\nconcluded against him. Accordingly, Guideline F is found against him, as is the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.S1.n: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

A\nNovember 2001 bankruptcy filing listing liabilities of $36,723.47 was dismissed in October 2002\nbecause of foreclosure proceedings on her mobile home. Financial considerations concerns are not\nmitigated where she owes more than $40,000 in delinquent debt and has not yet shown that she can\nlive within her means. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a position of\npublic trust.\n\nBy memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) dated\n1\nNovember 19, 2004, DOHA was authorized to utilize the procedures of DoD Directive 5220.6 to resolve contractor cases\nforwarded to it by the Defense Security Service (DSS) or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for trustworthiness\ndetermination, including those involving ADP-I, ADP-II, and ADP-III positions. Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness is\nadjudicated under the revised adjudicative guidelines set forth in Appendix 8 of Department of Defense Regulation\n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (\u201cRegulation\u201d).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 26, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as\namended and modified (\u201cRegulation\u201d), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 1992, as amended\nand modified (\u201cDirective\u201d).  In a Statement of Reasons (SOR), undated, DOHA proposed to deny\n1\nor revoke access to a sensitive position for Applicant because of conduct alleged under Guideline\nF (financial considerations) of the adjudicative guidelines. Applicant  answered the SOR on August\n22, 2006, and elected to have a decision on the written record without a hearing.\nThe government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 31, 2007,\nconsisting of 11 exhibits (Items 1-11). On February 1, 2007,  DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM\nto Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant submitted her\nrebuttal, which was notarized on March 7, 2007, and included documentation of a wage garnishment\nfor her student loan debt. On March 14, 2007, Department Counsel did not object to her response.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a position of trust.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged Applicant owes $43,706 in delinquent debt (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i), and that a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing with liabilities of $36,723.47 and assets of $35,104 was dismissed in\nOctober 2002 (\u00b6 1.j). Applicant admitted the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, as well\nas the bankruptcy filing (\u00b6 1.j). She explained that the debts listed in her Chapter 13 petition included\nmedical bills (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i), car debt (\u00b6 1.h), and a mortgage debt (\u00b6 1.g) for which she remained\nresponsible, even though she had given the house to her ex-husband in their divorce. She denied\nowing the $2,437 in \u00b6 1.c as she did not recognize the original creditor,  the $70 in \u00b6 1.e, as she\nthought it had been paid, and the $5,037 in \u00b6 1.f as the car had been sold and she was told she owed\n\u201c$1,000 and something.\u201d\n            Applicant\u2019s admissions to delinquent debt and to the bankruptcy filing and dismissal are\nincorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the documents before me for\nconsideration, I make the following additional findings:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old offsite claims processor/adjuster for a TRICARE support\ncontractor. She has been employed by the contractor since September 1996. While working full-time,\nshe pursued an associate\u2019s degree in business from 1998 to 2002.\n\nAlso listed was  a joint auto loan debt of $8,682 in collection. It is likely the debt in \u00b6 1.h, which was separately\n2\nlisted as a collection account with $8,240 past due.\n4\n In 2001, Applicant and her first husband separated. He did not pay court-ordered child\nsupport for their two children, then ages two and seven. Child support was initially set at $150 per\nweek but was later reduced to $56 per week. Applicant struggled financially. She and her ex-husband\nfell behind $3,600 in payments on the mobile home they had jointly purchased in January 1995, and\nthe lender repossessed the mobile home in May 2001. In November 2001, she filed a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy petition. Of the $36,723 in listed total liabilities, $26,000 was for the mobile home\nvalued at $28,169 (\u00b6 1.g). She also owed secured loans of $1,454.08 for a computer, $1,098 for\nfurniture, and $3,549.20 for a 1994 model-year van with a market value of $1,935. All but $400 of\nthe unsecured claims of $4,622.19 was for student loans incurred more than seven years before the\nbankruptcy filing. Based on a reported monthly net remainder of $195.25, Applicant planned to pay\n$155 each month under the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The bankruptcy was dismissed in October 2002\nbefore its scheduled completion.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on October 28, 2003, revealed several outstanding debts: a\n$1,928 past due balance for her computer (\u00b6 1.c); the involuntary repossession of the mobile home\nwith a balance due of $26,211 (\u00b6 1.g); a $73 debt in collection (not alleged); $8,240 past due on an\nindividual installment loan in collection (\u00b6 1.h);  a $79 debt in collection (not alleged); a $6,365\n2\nbalance for an automobile repossessed in 2001 (\u00b6 1.f); an $88 satellite dish television debt in\ncollection since May 2003 (not alleged); 13 medical debts in collection totaling $2,051 ($377 of it\nalleged in \u00b6 1.i); three cellular phone debts totaling $866 ($359 of it alleged in \u00b6 1.d); and a $305\ndebt balance owed a specialty merchant (not alleged). Also reported was a defaulted student loan of\n$2,000 taken out in March 1994 (not alleged). Another  student loan of $5,500 was in deferred status.\nOn December 12, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a special investigator for the Office\nof Personnel Management (OPM). She attributed her bankruptcy filing in 2001 to her divorce and\nex-husband\u2019s failure to pay child support, and claimed to have paid $200 per month for about six\nmonths under the plan before her bankruptcy was dismissed. Applicant acknowledged continuing\nfinancial struggles but asserted she was current in her bills. Applicant did not dispute the computer\ndebt (\u00b6 1.c), the mobile home debt (\u00b6 1.g), two car loan debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.f), the $73 balance owed\non a personal loan (not alleged), a delinquent phone bill of $79 (not alleged), or the defaulted student\nloan debt. She also did not dispute the accounts in collection with the exception of some cellular\nphone debts and the specialty merchant debt that had been listed in the collection section of her\ncredit report. Applicant denied her credit problems could be a source of blackmail or coercion and\nexpressed her intent to pay off the debts that were not included in the bankruptcy as soon as she was\nfinancially able. On December 16, 2003, Applicant provided a personal financial statement in which\nshe estimated a monthly net remainder of $56.28 after payment of her $525 monthly mortgage\nobligation and living expenses.\nApplicant was reinterviewed on March 1, 2004, about her financial delinquencies. She\nexplained her Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed after payments totaling about $700 when the\njudge learned of the foreclosure of the mobile home she had shared with her ex-husband. Applicant\nindicated she was working to clean up her credit, was \u201crenting to own\u201d the home she was living in,\nand was making payments on some of her medical accounts, including the $1,348 placed in\ncollection by a hospital. She disputed owing $26,221 for the mobile home, claiming it was her ex-\n\n5\nhusband\u2019s debt, as well as the $8,240 car loan because the vehicle had been stolen. Applicant related\nshe had paid the $88 satellite television debt as well as several medical debts in collection totaling\n$1,669. She acknowledged still owing on her student loans, on which she claimed to have started\nrepayment in March 2004, the car loan in \u00b6 1.f, and a $315 wireless phone balance (not alleged).\nOn August 26, 2004, Applicant executed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P)\nfor her duties as an \u201coffsite CA II\u201d with the TRICARE contractor. She listed her bankruptcy filing\nand its dismissal in response to question 22a. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you, or a company over which\nyou exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien,\nor had legal judgment rendered against you for a debt?\u201d but responded negatively to question 22b\nconcerning whether she was over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on October 9, 2004, indicated she was disputing the $2,100\npast due balance reportedly owed for the computer (\u00b6 1.c). Applicant was past due $40 on a credit\ncard balance of $377 (\u00b6 1.a), had made no progress toward repaying her other debts, including the\nmortgage loan for her repossessed mobile home (\u00b6 1.g), or her delinquent car loans with their\nreported balances of $8,240 (\u00b6 1.h) and $5,037 (\u00b6 1.f, $6,365 in 2003 credit check). She reportedly\nowed medical collection balances totaling $868 ($377 of it alleged in \u00b61.i). A $108 medical\ncollection debt was being disputed by Applicant. A cellular telephone debt of $333 was reported as\nhaving been paid in April 2004.\nA May 15, 2006, check of her credit revealed recent charged off debt. Two revolving charge\naccounts opened in 2004 had been charged off, for $426 in June 2004 (\u00b6 1.a) and for $539 in October\n2004 (\u00b6 1.b). Also in October 2004, another creditor had placed a $70 past due balance for collection\n(\u00b6 1.e). \nAs of August 2006, Applicant had remarried. When she answered the SOR, she disputed the\n$5,037 debt balance of \u00b6 1.f, contending it was instead about $1,000, and the debt for the computer,\nas she claimed to not recognize the assignee. She failed to provide any documentation showing she\nwas not responsible for those debts. She admitted owing on the loan for the mobile home as the\ncreditor refused to acknowledge that she had given the home to her ex-husband in the divorce and\nher name had been on the loan. Applicant also did not deny owing the $8,240 car loan balance (\u00b6 1.h)\nfor the vehicle that had been stolen.\nOn August 1, 2006, the U.S. government issued a wage garnishment order to collect\n$14,223.03 in delinquent student loan debt. Her wages have since been garnisheed at the rate of\n$110.20  per pay period (every other week). On February 2, 2007, the U.S. government intercepted\nher federal income tax refund of $2,294 and applied it to her student loan debt. On February 14,\n2007, $221 of her $246 state tax refund was applied toward her student loans. As of late February,\nApplicant had reduced her student loan obligation by about $4,168.\nAs of January 2007, a credit bureau reported unpaid medical collection debts totaling about\n$2,436, including the debt in \u00b6 1.i and $1,729 placed since November 2005, and other past due\nbalances of about $38,000 ($426 on \u00b6 1.a, $539 on \u00b6 1.b, $2,569 on \u00b6 1.c, $367 for the wireless\nphone, $74 on \u00b6 1.e, $476 for telephone services, $5,037 on \u00b6 1.f, $29,000 on \u00b6 1.e). The debt in \u00b6\n1.h was not listed. Applicant was reportedly $525 past due on a mortgage loan of $47,000 taken out\n\n6\nin February 2006. A new telephone services debt of $120 had been placed for collection in August\n2006.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national security\nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give\nthat person access to such information.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines set\nforth in the Regulation. \"The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that,\nbased on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that\n. . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity.\" Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\nAppendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative guidelines, as well as the specific factors\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions for determining eligibility for access to classified information\nand assignment to sensitive duties. In evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must apply the \"whole person concept,\" and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person in light of the adjudicative process factors: the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nRegulation AP8.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. Regulation AP8. Applicant struggled financially following\nher divorce, and filed for bankruptcy under the wage earner plan in November 2001. She made some\npayments (disparately reported by her to be as little as $700 and as much as $1,200) but the\nbankruptcy was dismissed in October 2002 before all of her creditors had been paid. As of her filing\nof her SF 85P in August 2004, she was legally liable for approximately $42,500 in delinquent debt,\nnot including the student loans. Her record of financial problems raises concerns under DC (1)  A\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations and DC (3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\nWith the exception of the car loan in \u00b6 1.h, which she stopped paying for in or before 1998\napparently because the vehicle was stolen, her problems began around the time of her marital\nseparation in 2001. Mitigating condition (MC) (3) The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\n\n7\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) applies in extenuation of her incurring much\nof the debt alleged and failure to repay it before her interviews with the OPM investigator. While she\nhad a positive monthly remainder as of December 2003, $56.28 is an insignificant amount for a\nsingle parent with two minor children.\nHowever, even if debt is incurred by circumstances beyond one\u2019s control, financial pressures\nmay be such to present a significant risk.  To her credit, Applicant had paid some of her outstanding\nmedical debts in collection (MC (6) The individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts), although some of the debts she claims she satisfied are still\nbeing reported as unpaid by at least one credit bureau. Applicant\u2019s student loans were being repaid\nthrough wage garnishment, albeit pursuant to court order. Yet, despite her remarriage and some\nlifting of the financial burden (\u201cI have marriage again and with my husband help am able to take care\nof my children more than in the past. With the help of their grandparents it has taken some of the\nloaded [sic] off me.\u201d), Applicant owes delinquent debt in excess of $40,000, not counting the student\nloans. Even if collection is not pursued of the charged-off repossessed mobile home debt, there is\nlittle guarantee that she will be able to get out of financial difficulty in the near future. As reflected\nin her credit report of January 2007, she was $525 past due in her mortgage. Since November 2005,\n$1,729 in medical debt and $120 for telephone services had been newly placed for collection. Her\ncredit report of January 2007 does not substantiate her claimed satisfaction of the debt in \u00b6 1.e, or\nthat she owes only $1,000 rather than $5,037 on the car loan in \u00b6 1.f. Applicant has not yet displayed\nthe good personal financial judgment that must be demanded of those persons in a position of public\ntrust.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance,\u201d or as applied to\ntrustworthiness cases, a position of trust. AP8. Applicant has had very serious financial problems\nsince 2001 (The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct). Very recent efforts to address her\nstudent loans were prompted by court-ordered wage garnishment action (The presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes). A favorable change in her financial habits\nis not shown where she has fallen behind in her mortgage and has not paid medical debts of as little\nas $26.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Additionally,\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s credibility is suspect since she knew or should have known that the information that she\nprovided to the Government in a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (QPTP) on September 9,\n2004, regarding her indebtedness, was materially incorrect and incomplete. Mitigation has not been\nshown. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that Applicant is\neligible for assignment to a sensitive position and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge\nto make a determination on this issue.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated August 16, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations (RSOR). She requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn October 13, 2006, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A\ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and she was\ngiven the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nA response was due by December 8, 2006, but Applicant filed no response to the FORM. The case\nwas assigned to this Administrative Judge on December 27, 2006.\nDepartment Counsel offered nine documentary items (Exhibits 1-9), which have been\nadmitted without objection. Applicant offered no documentary evidence into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains 12\nallegations, 1.a., through 1.l., under Guideline F, and one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline E. In her\nRSOR, Applicant has admitted SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.l., and denied 2.a. (Exhibit 3). The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nSince this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to\nthe contents of the various documents that are found in the case file. After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's RSOR, the FORM, and the admitted\ndocuments, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings\nof fact: \nAccording to the information furnished in Applicant\u2019s QPTP, executed on September 9,\n2004, (Exhibit 4), Applicant is 30 years old, and she is unmarried. Applicant is an employee of a\ndefense contractor, and she seeks assignment to sensitive duties.\n\n3\n.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists 12 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.1, under Adjudicative Guideline\nF totaling approximately $13,406. As stated above, Applicant\u2019s has admitted each allegation under\nGuideline F (Exhibit 3). No independent evidence has been introduced to indicate that any of these\ndebts has been resolved or even reduced. The debts will be listed in the same order as they were in\nthe SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $102.09.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $260.23.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $843.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,910.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,862.02.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,022.96.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $61,067.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $919.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $524.\n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $788.\n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,938.\n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $170.\nIn a signed, sworn affidavit made by Applicant on June 10, 2005, she contended that she had\nconsolidated all of her credit card accounts, established a payment plan agreed to by all parties, and\nthat all of her debts were to have been paid in three years. Yet she conceded that she continued to\nreceive indications that these bill were not resolved (Exhibit 5).  Not only was no evidence offered\nwhich could establish that any of these overdue debts were satisfactorily resolved, but Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions of all of her overdue debts in her RSOR (Exhibit 3) completely contradicts her contention\nthat the debts were paid. I therefore conclude that all of the overdue debts listed on the SOR are still\n\n4\ndue and owing. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nwhen she completed a signed, sworn QPTP on September 9, 2004,  she furnished untruthful\ninformation to the Government (Exhibit 4). \nQuestion #20 asks,  \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial\nobligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.)\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. In her RSOR (Exhibit 3), Applicant claimed that she was\nhonest in information that she furnished to the investigator when she was questioned, but she\nprovided no information as to the reason that she answered  \u201cNo\u201d to question  #20.\nAt the time she completed the QPTP, Applicant had been over 180 days delinquent on all of\nthe debts listed above as 1.a. through 1.h. She should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question and\nincluded all of these debts that were more than 180 days overdue.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\" Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988). In Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, \u00a7 3.1(b) (August 4,\n1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only\nto United States citizens \"whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to\nthe United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound\njudgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness\nand ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\" \nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \"The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\" DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n\n5\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F and E: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly\nestablishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved these overdue debts.\nApplicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A6.1.2.1.), and DC (E2.A6.1.2.3.), a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. I find that no\n\n6\nMitigating Condition (MC) is applicable to this case. \nUntil Applicant makes a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she can establish a record\nof financial responsibility and stability, concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve\nGuideline F against Applicant.\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant knew or should have\nknown that she provided false material information to the Government in response to a question  on\nthe QPTP that she signed on September 9, 2004.  She should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to question #20,\nand included all of the debts listed in the SOR that had been more than 180 days overdue, which\nwere 1.a. through 1.h.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC E2.A5.1.2.2. applies because\nthe information that Applicant provided in her QPTP was known or should have been known by her\nto be omissions and concealment of relevant and material facts.  No MCs apply.\nIn this case, Applicant failed to offer any independent evidence indicating that she has\nreformed and is now reliable and trustworthy. This precludes a finding that it is now clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information. I resolve Guideline\nE against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

He shares close bonds with his parents and two brothers, who are\nresident citizens of Taiwan, and he owns a residence that his parents rent out to supplement their\nincome. While his service in the Taiwanese Army predated his U.S. citizenship, he is unwilling to\nsurrender a valid Taiwanese passport that he acquired on renewal. Foreign influence and foreign\npreference concerns are not mitigated. Personal conduct concerns persist because of his knowing,\nfalse denial that he had an active foreign passport when he completed his clearance application.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 27, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence),\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense\neffective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 29, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on August 21, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. At the hearing, two\ngovernment exhibits (Ex. 1- 2) and four Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted, and testimony\nwas taken from Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 4, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn June 26, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC or China).  Authority\nto consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and evidence and\nshall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner).\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative\nproceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No.\n02-24875 (decided Oct. 12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative\njudge who took  administrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was\nprovided in advance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present\nalternative information for the judge to notice.\n\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated April 2007 (I), Background Note: China, dated January 2007 (VIII),\n1\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007 (XI), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated March 19, 2007 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n2\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (VII). The document was prepared for the\n3\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (III) and\n4\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (X). \nSee 2006 Report to Congress, November 2006 (IX).\n5\nThe press releases (IV) and (V) were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan actively pursues\n6\ncollection of U.S. economic and propriety information. Neither case involves Applicant personally. The April 18, 2006,\npress release (IV) concerns the sentencing of a U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft between December\n1999 and December 2001 to the benefit of a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no evidence that Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment was involved in, or sanctioned the criminal activity. The January 22, 2007 (V) press release concerns the\nsentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for, in part, making false statements to the government concerning\nhis relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer and by not reporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where\nhe met with the foreign intelligence officer. \nSee U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005 (VI). The\n7\ncourt records do not pertain to any criminal charge against Applicant.\nWhile a  Taiwanese intelligence official was implicated in cultivating a personal relationship with a U.S. State\n8\nDepartment official (VI), there is no indication that Applicant has ever been targeted.\n3\nApplicant filed no objection to the proposed facts for administrative notice, but this does not\nrelieve me of the responsibility to determine whether the proposed facts are proper for administrative\nnotice, i.e., easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case before me.\nFor source documentation the government relied on publications of the Department of State;  the\n1\nCongressional Research Service;  the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies;  the\n2\n3\nNational Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive;  the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission;  two press releases from\n4\n5\nthe U.S. Department of Justice;  and a record of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of\n6\nVirginia.7\nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and\nmateriality of the facts proposed, I took administrative notice of certain facts as set forth below.8\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a),\nfather (SOR \u00b6 1.b), two brothers (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and extended family members (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are resident\ncitizens of Taiwan; that another of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a Taiwanese citizen living in the U.S.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d); that Applicant owns a residence in Taiwan rented out by his parents as part of their\nincome (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that Applicant traveled to Taiwan in February 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Under\nGuideline C, foreign preference, Applicant was alleged to have renewed his Taiwanese passport in\n\n4\n2003 for another ten years (SOR \u00b6 2.a); to be unwilling as of August 2006 to surrender, destroy, or\notherwise invalidate the Taiwanese passport (SOR \u00b6 2.b); to have used his Taiwanese passport\ninstead of his U.S. passport for travel to Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.c); to have served in the Taiwanese Army\nfor about 22 months starting in 1981 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and to be unwilling to renounce his dual\ncitizenship (SOR \u00b6 2.e). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified\nhis November 2004 electronic personnel security questionnaire by not disclosing that he owned the\nresidence in Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 3.a), that he had contact with foreign government officials to renew his\nTaiwanese passport (SOR \u00b6 3.c), and by denying that he held an active foreign passport (SOR \u00b6 3.d).\nApplicant was also alleged to have falsified a February 2006 statement by denying he owned any\nproperty in Taiwan and that he was maintaining his dual citizenship to protect this foreign  property\ninterest (SOR \u00b6 3.b).\nIn his Answer of May 21, 2007, Applicant admitted the foreign influence allegations without\nexplanation. He also admitted the foreign preference allegations, explaining that he was unwilling\nto renounce his Taiwanese citizenship or surrender his passport because his parents would lose the\nhouse listed under his name but owned by them if he was no longer a Taiwanese citizen. He\nattributed his use of the Taiwanese passport to convenience (more customs lines for those with\nTaiwanese passports) rather than any preference for Taiwan. Concerning his past military service in\nTaiwan\u2019s Army, Applicant indicated it was mandatory. As for the personal conduct allegations.\nApplicant answered \u201cI admit\u201d  to failing to disclose his property ownership, contacts with a foreign\ngovernment, and possession of a valid passport when he completed his security clearance\napplication, although he claimed to not have understood that applying for a passport constituted\ncontact with a foreign government. Applicant averred that with respect to his property ownership,\nhe had authorized his parents to deal with the house and he did not own it. He had no explanation\nfor not disclosing that he had a Taiwanese passport. Applicant partially denied the falsification of\nhis sworn statement, and indicated in explanation, \u201cI believe I had said that I would have to talk to\nmy parents about giving up my Taiwan citizenship.\u201d\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take\nadministrative notice, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior software engineer. He earned his master of science degree\nin computer science from a public university in the U.S. in June 1986. He has been working for his\npresent employer, a defense contractor, since November 2005 and seeks a security clearance so that\nhe can work on classified projects.\nApplicant\u2019s Background and Foreign Ties\nApplicant was born in October 1956 in Taiwan. His mother is a  native of the PRC, who had\nimmigrated to Taiwan as a teenager in 1949. Applicant\u2019s father is a native of Taiwan. Applicant has\nthree younger brothers, who were born in 1958, 1962, and 1968.  After earning his bachelor\u2019s degree\nfrom a university in Taiwan, Applicant completed compulsory military service in Taiwan\u2019s Army.\nApplicant served for about 20 months beginning in January 1981. He was not an officer.\nWhile Applicant was studying at the Taiwanese university, his parents bought real estate in\nTaiwan in August 1980. Applicant was recorded as the owner of the property, although the purchase\nwas funded and handled by his parents. He has never seen the property.\n\nThere is conflicting evidence as to whether Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 2002, as indicated on his SF 86,\n9\nor in February 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) (see Tr. 101-02). Whether the Taiwanese passport was issued to him in  2002 or 2003,\nApplicant does not dispute that he still has possession of a valid Taiwanese passport.\nDOHA alleged and Applicant admitted that his term of service was about one year and ten months, which is\n10\nlonger than the one year reported on his SF 86.\n5\nApplicant came to the U.S. in about 1983 to further his education. After some time studying\nto pass an English proficiency examination, Applicant began masters\u2019 degree studies in computer\nscience at a public university in January 1984. He was awarded his degree in June 1986, and that\nNovember, he married a U.S. native citizen. They had worked at the same restaurant while he was\nin graduate school. They honeymooned in Taiwan. Applicant and his spouse have three children,\nwho were born in July 1989, July 1994, and November 1996. He began working in the software\nsector in the U.S., and in August 1991, he and his spouse purchased their current residence in the\nU.S.\nIn late August 1991, Applicant took the oath of U.S. naturalization, vowing to renounce all\nforeign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or\nperform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant took\nno action to formally renounce his Taiwanese citizenship.\nAt his father\u2019s request, Applicant went to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in his\nlocal area and executed on January 14, 1995, a power of attorney. Applicant designated his father\nas his agent to deal with the property he owed in Taiwan. He authorized his father to \u201copen a wire\ntransfer account from [bank name omitted] on behalf of [Applicant] for entering the contract,\nwithdrawal, mortgage setting, cancellation and applying seal certificate, household certificate\ntranscript, and other related matters\u201d with respect to the land and building. (Ex. A)\nOn November 2, 1995, Applicant was issued his U.S. passport. He continued to maintain his\nTaiwanese passport and to use that passport for convenience (to avoid customs delays) when\ntraveling to Taiwan to see his relatives. In addition to their honeymoon, his spouse has been to\nTaiwan \u201conce or twice.\u201d (Tr. 107) Their two oldest children have been to Taiwan. Applicant traveled\nalone to Taiwan to see his parents and siblings in either February 2002 or 2003.  While in Taiwan,\n9\nhe renewed his Taiwanese passport at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He renewed it for convenience\nin traveling to Taiwan and because of his understanding that he has to maintain it to keep the\nproperty in Taiwan.\nApplicant worked in a succession of computer/communications companies until August 2002\nwhen he was laid off. He was unemployed for more than two years. In mid-November 2004,\nApplicant began working as a software engineer for a contractor at a military installation. Applicant\ncompleted a security clearance application (SF 86) on November 28, 2004. He disclosed his dual\ncitizenship with the U.S. and Taiwan, the Taiwanese citizenship and residency of his parents and two\nyoungest brothers, and the dual citizenship (Taiwan and U.S.) and U.S. residency of the brother\nclosest in age to him. Applicant also indicated that he had served in Taiwan\u2019s Army from January\n1981 to January 1982,  and that he had traveled to Taiwan for pleasure in February 2002.  Applicant\n10\nresponded \u201cNO\u201d to question 12 concerning \u201cany foreign property, business connections, or financial\ninterests.\u201d Since his parents had purchased the property in Taiwan, his mother had told him that it\n\nIt may be inferred from the government\u2019s allegation and Applicant\u2019s partial admission that he was interviewed\n11\nby an investigator for the government on February 1, 2006. No written transcript, summary, or sworn statement of that\ninterview is in evidence, although Applicant affirmed at the hearing that he had made certain statements to the\ninvestigator. Some information was also gleaned from Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR \u00b6 3.b.\n6\nwas not his despite being in his name, and he believed he had given his father the right to do what\nhe wanted with the property, Applicant regarded the property as his parents\u2019 even though it was still\nin his name (\u201cI should have said the whole thing, like there is a house under my name that I passed\nto my father, he has authorization to do anything he wants.\u201d Tr. 95). Applicant also responded\nnegatively to question 14 [\u201cHave you ever had any contact with a foreign government, its\nestablishments (embassies or consulates), or its representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S.,\nother than on official U.S. Government business? (Does not include routine visa applications and\nborder crossing controls). He did not consider renewing his Taiwanese passport to constitute the type\nof government contact that had to be reported. Applicant did not disclose that he had an active\nTaiwanese passport, responding \u201cNO\u201d to question 15 [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had an active\npassport that was issued by a foreign government?\u201d]. He claims to not know why he had responded\nnegatively as he had renewed his Taiwanese passport in February 2002 or February 2003.\nIn November 2005, Applicant went to work for his current employer. The company\nsponsored his need for access to classified information, and Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator on or about February 1, 2006.   He showed the agent both his U.S. and\n11\nTaiwanese passports. Applicant was asked whether he would be willing to renounce his Taiwanese\ncitizenship. He indicated he would have to talk to his parents about giving up his Taiwanese\ncitizenship.\nOn or about July 11, 2006, DOHA asked Applicant to verify that he had relinquished his\nTaiwanese passport and whether he was willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. In his\nresponse of August 8, 2006, Applicant stated in part:\nIt is difficult for me to make the decision to relinquish my Taiwanese passport.\nDecades ago, my parents purchased a residence under my name in Taiwan and rent\nthis property out as part of their income. If I were to relinquish my Taiwanese\npassport, the apartment would belong to the government and my parents would lose\ntheir rental income. Due to the age of my parents, my father is eighty two years old\nand my mother is seventy four, I would prefer not to put my parents under the distress\nof losing this property and income. (Ex. 2)\nAs of mid-August 2007, Applicant was not willing to relinquish his Taiwanese passport\nbecause of his belief that if he did so, the apartment in his name in Taiwan would revert to the\nTaiwanese government and he wanted his parents to continue to receive the rental income. Applicant\nhas never checked with the Taiwanese authorities to see whether this was in fact the case (\u201cI assume\nthat\u2019s just houses [sic] under nobody\u2019s name, the government is going to take it. . . .\u201d Tr.  104).\nApplicant has not seriously considered listing his parents as principal owners of the property because\nof the higher inheritance taxes on their estate if he did so. (Tr. 72) He does not want to lose the\nforeign asset. (Tr. 79) He has not looked into whether he would retain ownership if solely a citizen\nof the U.S. (Tr. 104) Applicant has no other foreign investments.\n\n7\n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and two of his three brothers are resident citizens of Taiwan as of August\n2007. His 82-year-old father retired from the government-run telephone company in 1986 or 1987.\nHis 74-year-old mother never worked outside of the home. They live on his father\u2019s pension and the\nincome from the apartment in Applicant\u2019s name in Taiwan. Applicant offers his mother $100 to $200\nfor pocket money when he sees her, but she doesn\u2019t take it. He does not send his parents money.\nApplicant\u2019s parents have visited him in the U.S. about four or five times, including for three or four\nweeks in June 2007. They came for his son\u2019s high school graduation and stayed with him and his\nfamily. Applicant had not seen his parents since he traveled to Taiwan in February 2002 or 2003.\nApplicant has had about monthly contact with his parents by telephone, although lately the contact\nhas increased to weekly. Their conversations revolve around their health and well-being and efforts\non his part to convert them to Christianity.\nApplicant\u2019s two brothers in Taiwan work as a computer engineer and as a stockbroker.\nApplicant believes his brothers are employed by private firms but he is not sure. Since Applicant\ncame to the U.S. for graduate school, he has talked with his brothers in Taiwan by telephone about\nfour or five times. He considers his relationships with his brothers in Taiwan to be \u201cclose.\u201d (Tr. 77)\nApplicant has several aunts and cousins living in Taiwan with whom he converses \u201conce in a long,\nlong while.\u201d (Tr. 78)\nApplicant\u2019s other brother, who has become a naturalized citizen, lives in the U.S. He is a\nmechanical engineer. Applicant and this brother get together usually twice a year, although they had\nin-person contact \u201cquite a few times\u201d (Tr. 83) during his parents\u2019 visit in June 2007. Applicant and\nthis brother have discussed going together to Taiwan to see their parents next Christmas. Now\nknowing of the government\u2019s concerns with travel on his Taiwanese passport, Applicant indicated\nhe would probably travel on his U.S. passport to Taiwan. He would have to renew it as it had expired\nas of August 2007. He has a current Taiwanese passport.\nApplicant estimates that his home in the U.S. is valued at between $600,000 and $700,000.\nHe has about $60,000 to $70,000 in 401(k) assets in the U.S. and $15,000 in savings. His son attends\ncollege in the U.S. His other children attend local public schools. Since neither his spouse nor\nchildren speak Chinese, English is spoken in their home.\nDuring his first full year on the job for the defense contractor, Applicant\u2019s performance met\nhis employer\u2019s requirements. He exhibited a good attitude, strong programming skills, and\ndedication.\nAdministrative notice was taken of the following adjudicative facts. The government of\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy. The United States recognizes that there is only one China, that\nthe government of the PRC is the sole legal government of China, and that Taiwan is part of China.\nNonetheless, under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial relations with\nTaiwan. Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to sell appropriate\nmilitary defensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most important\ntrading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose primary mission is the\ndefense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has not renounced\nthe use of force against Taiwan. It is U.S. policy that the resolutions of disputes between Taiwan and\nChina be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power and a member of the World Trade\nOrganization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the U.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The\n\n8\nU.S. State Department reports that Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human\nrights and create a democratic political system since ending martial law. In the past, organizations\nin Taiwan employed unlawful methods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence information.\nTaiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As recently as\n2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S. State\nDepartment official. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or\nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). Applicant feels close to his parents and brothers in Taiwan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a, 1.b, 1.c). He has traveled to Taiwan to visit them (SOR \u00b6 1.g). His contact with his parents has\nbeen weekly of late, and they stayed with him on his son\u2019s high school graduation in June 2007.\nDespite his limited correspondence (four to five times since 1984) with his two brothers in Taiwan,\nhe admitted he has strong emotional ties to them. Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with\na foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen\n\nAlthough Applicant spoke in terms of inheritance, he is the owner of the property. It is his choice to give his\n12\nfather not only the authority to deal with the asset but also to enjoy the rental income.\n9\nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion), applies.\nFurthermore, Applicant is listed as the owner of real estate in Taiwan that his parents benefit\nfrom in the form of rental income. While Applicant has never seen the property and was unable to\nprovide any information about its market value, it is considered a substantial foreign property\ninterest. He expects some financial benefit from the property on his parents\u2019 deaths,  and as of\n12\nAugust 2007 was unwilling to take any action, such as renouncing his Taiwanese citizenship or\nrelinquishing his Taiwanese passport, that could jeopardize his stake in the property. Concerns are\nraised under \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or\nin any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened\nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation).\nApplicant\u2019s travel to Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) is relevant to the extent it is an objective indicator\nof the bond between him and his parents and siblings in Taiwan, but it is not disqualifying in and of\nitself unless he engaged in conduct while there that made him vulnerable to exploitation, pressure,\nor coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or coercion (\u00b6 7(i)). There is nothing to indicate\nthat his renewal of his foreign passport was other than routine. Applicant\u2019s desire to retain the\nproperty, and foreign passport to protect that asset, heightens his vulnerability but that is separately\nalleged under SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nConcerns of a heightened risk because of the Taiwanese citizenship and residency of his\naunts and cousins (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are not persuasive in the absence of any close affinity or obligation\nto these extended family members (see \u00b6 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation).  Applicant has a close bond with his brother in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.d), but this\nbrother\u2019s U.S. naturalization and residency remove him from the physical reach of Taiwanese\nauthorities, and there is nothing about his duties as a mechanical engineer in the U.S. that presents\na heightened risk.\nThe familial bonds with his parents and brothers in Taiwan are too strong to satisfy the first\nprong of mitigating condition  \u00b6 8(a)(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterest of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.).\nWhile it is not clear what Applicant would do if his relatives were pressured, the risk of him being\nplaced in a position where he would have to choose between them and the U.S. is diminished\nsomewhat by the fact that Taiwan does not have a hostile relationship with the U.S., and is not\nknown to sponsor terrorism. Taiwan has a defense pact with the U.S., and has made considerable\nprogress in achieving democratic elections, civil liberties, and stable, viable governmental\ninstitutions. As reported by the U.S. State Department, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve\nrespect for human rights and create a democratic political system since ending marital law in 1987.\nAlmost all restrictions on the press have ended, restrictions on personal freedoms have been relaxed,\nand the prohibition against organizing new political parties has been lifted. While the U.S. does not\n\n10\nsupport independence for Taiwan and is committed to a one China policy, under the Taiwan\nRelations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself,\nincluding making available defensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. U.S. commercial ties\nwith Taiwan have been maintained and expanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to jeopardize\nits relationship with the U.S. by overly pressuring its citizens.\nEven nations with a history of friendly relations do not always have the same interests,\nhowever. Taiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As\nrecently as 2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S.\nState Department official that bears troubling implications, although no proof of, active collection\nefforts by or on behalf of the Taiwanese government. There is nothing about his father\u2019s present\nstatus as a retiree, or his former employment with the government-owned telephone company that\nsuggests military, intelligence, or security implications. Not enough is known about the associates,\nactivities, or with respect to his brothers their employments, to conclude that Applicant is not at\nheightened risk, however. Security concerns could be overcome by deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see \u00b6 8(b), there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest).\nApplicant has significant ties to the U.S., most notably his citizenship, marriage to a U.S. native\ncitizen, financial assets, and his career, but they are not enough to guarantee that Applicant will act\nin favor of the U.S. given his demonstrated desire that his parents retain the income from his\nproperty in Taiwan, that he enjoyed the financial benefit on their deaths, and that he not incur higher\ninheritance taxes. When asked by the government investigator in February 2006 about his\nwillingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship, Applicant recalls he told the agent that he would\nhave to ask his parents. Clearly, he remains concerned about them and their opinions. Under the\ncircumstances, neither MC \u00b6 8(b) nor \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business,\nfinancial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual) apply.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). Applicant came to the U.S. in 1983 for\ngraduate school after completing his compulsory military service for his native Taiwan. He met and\nlater married a U.S. native citizen, and eventually became a U.S. citizen in August 1991. He\ncontinued to maintain his Taiwanese passport for convenience in traveling to Taiwan and out of\nconcern that he would lose his property in Taiwan if he did not retain his Taiwanese passport and\ncitizenship. He used his Taiwanese passport in preference to his U.S. passport when traveling to\nTaiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.c), and  renewed the Taiwanese passport during his last visit to Taiwan in February\n2002 or February 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It was still valid for foreign travel as of August 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s mandatory military service for Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.d) does not raise foreign preference\nconcerns because it occurred when he was solely a citizen of Taiwan, before he came to the U.S.\nDC \u00b6 10(a) is implicated where the exercise of rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurs after one becomes a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nGuideline C concerns are raised, however, by Applicant\u2019s possession of a current Taiwanese\n\n11\npassport. DC \u00b6 10(a)(1) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is\nnot limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport) applies. Furthermore, his retention of\nhis foreign passport is not solely for convenience, but is also to ensure that he not jeopardize his\nproperty interest and future financial benefits from that interest, \u00b6 10(a)(5) (using foreign citizenship\nto protect financial or business interest in another country) also must be considered.\nAs of August 2007, Applicant had not expressed a willingness to renounce his Taiwanese\ncitizenship (SOR \u00b6 2.e). A willingness to renounce dual citizenship is potentially mitigating under\n\u00b6 11(b), but there is no requirement that foreign citizenship be renounced. Retention of foreign\ncitizenship out of respect for one\u2019s heritage, for example,  is not disqualifying absent the exercise\nof a right, privilege, or obligation of that citizenship. But the security concerns raised by his use of\nforeign citizenship to protect his property asset in Taiwan are not mitigated where he is unwilling\nto renounce his Taiwanese citizenship because of the potential negative impact on this foreign\nfinancial interest.\n Applicant has also not mitigated the foreign preference concerns raised by his retention of\na current Taiwanese passport. He has not obtained the approval for its use that is required under MC\n\u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority). Nor has he\nrendered it invalid for foreign travel (see MC \u00b6 11(e), the passport has been destroyed, surrendered\nto the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated). It is not clear that Applicant was\napprised during his February 2006 interview, or with the August 2006 interrogatory, of the specific\nconcerns underlying foreign travel. In the interrogatory, Applicant was directed to \u201cProvide\ndocumentation from the Taiwanese embassy or consulate verifying you have relinquished your\nTaiwanese passport. See enclosure re: Foreign Passports,\u201d but the enclosure was not included in the\nhearing record. (See Ex. 2) On receipt of the SOR, Applicant was apprised of the two potential\nmitigating conditions under \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e). His failure to take any action thereafter raises\nconsiderable doubts as to his willingness to comply with Department of Defense requirements. As\nof August 2007, he and his brother had spoken about traveling to Taiwan together next Christmas.\nSince Applicant\u2019s U.S. passport had expired, travel on his Taiwanese passport cannot be ruled out,\neven though he has been made aware of the security concerns (\u201cI probably will use the U.S.\npassport.\u201d Tr. 88).\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) When he completed his SF 86 in November\n2004, Applicant did not disclose that he had an active foreign passport issued to him in the last seven\nyears (SOR \u00b6 3.d),  that he had any foreign property interests (SOR \u00b6 3.a), or that he had any contact\nwith a foreign government ( SOR \u00b6 3.c). Applicant thought the inquiry into contacts with a foreign\ngovernment was limited to security matters and did not include  routine contacts regarding passports\n(see Tr. 115). Given question 14 specifically excludes routine visa applications, his claim of\nmisunderstanding is accepted. As for his failure to list his ownership of the foreign property,\nApplicant knew he was the named owner, but did not consider the property to be his since it was\n\n12\npurchased by his parents, he had never seen it, they enjoyed the rental income, he had been told by\nhis mother that it was not his, and he had executed a power of attorney back in 1995 and not again\nseen until about June 2007 which he thought gave his father control over the property. Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony as to possibly inheriting the property shows he still does not regard himself as the owner\n(\u201cI said that I don\u2019t want them to lose the land either and also it\u2019s a, when it\u2019s time to pass that house\nto me, I also don\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d Tr. 79).\n Yet Applicant has not provided a credible explanation for his clearly false response to\nwhether he had an active foreign passport within the last 7 years. He had listed a trip to Taiwan in\n2002, knowing that he had renewed his foreign passport when he was in Taiwan. He also testified\nthat he had the passport with him when he completed his SF 86 (Tr. 103). Disqualifying condition\n\u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies.\nAll indications are that the government first learned Applicant had an active foreign passport\nwhen he was interviewed by a government investigator in about February 2006. Applicant testified\nthat he brought the passport with him and that the agent reviewed it (Tr. 101). This disclosure comes\ntoo late to satisfy MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts). With so little information\navailable as to what Applicant told the agent (no record of interview, no signed statement), I am\nunable to conclude that Applicant intentionally lied to the investigator. Any knowingly false\nstatement would implicate \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical\nauthority, or other official government representative). The following exchange between Applicant\nand Department Counsel suggests again that Applicant was under the impression that he did not own\nthe financial interests outside of the U.S.:\nQ And it\u2019s your belief that they bought property in your name as a sort of an\ninheritance from you?\nA I took it this way. When they retired, I told them to sell the property so that they\nwould have money to enjoy the rest of their life. My mother made a comment that\nthat\u2019s not your property, it\u2019s just your names by it, so don\u2019t make any suggestions. \n(Tr. 64)  In light of Applicant\u2019s expressed desire to retain what he considers to be an inheritance\ninterest in the property in his name in Taiwan, any denial that he was maintaining dual citizenship\nto protect that property interest or inheritance rights would raise doubts about his veracity, but there\nis also indication that Applicant had another motive (see Tr. 79, \u201cYou indicated that you would\nprefer to maintain your Taiwanese citizenship out of respect for your heritage and your parents, is\nthat accurate?\u201d). While the evidence is insufficient to prove that Applicant acted to mislead the\ninvestigator, it is also insufficient to find that Applicant is rehabilitated from his SF 86 false\nstatement about his possession of a foreign passport. He has not shown any meaningful appreciation\nof the obligation to be completely candid at all times where he refuses to acknowledge the knowing\nfalsity of his negative response to the passport question (\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t understand the question,\nObviously I renewed my passport, I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know why, I mean there is no reason for me to\nsay no, I didn\u2019t renew my passport, obviously I did.\u201d Tr. 99).\n\n13\nWhole Person Analysis\nUnder the whole-person evaluation required under the Directive (The adjudicative process\nis an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that\nthe person is eligible for a security clearance (AG \u00b6 2(a)), Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are relevant\nin determining whether he can be counted on to fulfill the fiduciary responsibilities of a clearance.\nDespite his continuous residency in the U.S. since about 1983, his marriage to a U.S. citizen, his\nacquisition of U.S. citizenship and a U.S. passport, he continued to act out of concern for his parents\nand his own stake in property in Taiwan. He has not yet shown that he can be counted on to put U.S.\ninterests ahead of personal or familial interests.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

He was recently promoted to supervisor in 2005. While he has been in a job where he has previously not needed a security clearance, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in April 2004.

The SOR detailed reasons why the \nGovernment could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.1 \nThe SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial Considerations (Guideline F) in \nparagraph 1, Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 2, and Personal Conduct \n(Guideline E) in paragraph 3.  These security issues were alleged based on the revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines2 issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the \n \n1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.   \n \n2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with his SOR and provided again by \nDepartment Counsel on July 30, 2007.  While he received it, he did not bring a copy with him, so he was \ngiven time before the hearing proceeded to review it.  (TR 5, 13) \n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nDepartment of Defense, to be effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to \nthese SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of July 7, 2007, where he admitted in part \nand denied in part various allegations, and requested a hearing.   On August 31, 2007, \nDepartment Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the SOR to add numerous additional \nallegations to paragraph 2 (2.f. through 2.m.)  At the hearing Applicant stated he had no \nobjection to the Motion to Amend; consequently, I granted the Motion to Amend.   (TR \n12)  While Applicant paid some of the delinquent debts and provided evidence on his \ncriminal and personal conduct, he was unable to document efforts to establish a plan to \nresolve the remaining debts or to demonstrate a path to rehabilitation.  Consequently, \nclearance is denied. \n \n            Department Counsel on August 3, 2007, submitted a Ready to Proceed notice.  \nSubsequently the case was assigned to me on August 3, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing \nissued on August 16, 2007, set the matter for September 25, 2007. \n \n            At the hearing Department Counsel offered thirteen documents (Exhibits 1-13) \nthat were admitted into evidence.  In response to Applicant\u2019s objection on the grounds \nof inaccuracy, part of Exhibit 2 was redacted before it was admitted.  (TR 17-26)  \nExhibits 3 and 4 were admitted over his objection; however, he was allowed additional \ntime to submit information to clarify the issues he raised. (TR 28-31)  Applicant offered \nno documents, but testified himself.  At his request, and as the Department Counsel did \nnot object, we left the record open until October 9, 2007, in order for him to submit \nsupplemental information.  (TR 41, 72-73, 110-112)  However, he submitted no \nadditional evidence, so the record closed on October 9, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was \nreceived on October 3, 2007. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \n            Applicant is 38 years old and has worked in a technical job for a defense \ncontractor for eight years, from 1999 to the present. He was recently promoted \nto supervisor in 2005.  While he has been in a job where he has previously not needed \na security clearance, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) to \nobtain a security clearance in April 2004. (Exhibit 1; TR 4-7; 54-55)    \n \nApplicant completed the 11th grade.  He married in May 1998.  (Exhibit 1; TR 4) \n After he had marital difficulties, they separated in 2002.  Initially, he had custody of their \nfive children ages 11 to 19; but later his wife got custody.  He also has two other \nchildren, one is a step-child.  (TR 45-47; 51-52) \n \nFinances, Criminal Conduct, Personal Conduct \n \n            Applicant provided no adverse information on his SF 86 concerning his \ndelinquent debts of approximately $9,000 to fifteen creditors and his criminal record.  \n(Exhibits 2 -13) \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n            Applicant denied allegation 1.a. as he resolved the $595 debt to Creditor #1 \nwhen his pay was garnished for a judgment entered against him for damages to a rental \nhouse.  (Answer, TR 41; 55-59) \n \nApplicant denied allegation 1.b. to Creditor #2, but stated his pay was being \ngarnished to resolve this $1,000 judgment to a city for a utility debt.  (Answer, TR 59-61) \n \nApplicant admitted debts to creditors in allegations 1.c. to 1.j.  (Answer) \n \nApplicant denied allegation 1.k. for $148. At his hearing he admitted he owed the \ncreditor $148, but had not paid due to financial problems.  He denied 1.l. and 1.n., as he \ndoes not know who those creditors are.  He denied 1.m. because he was entitled to his \nunemployment compensation.  He admitted 1.o.  (Answer, TR 62-67) \n \n            His marital difficulties in 2001 and other issues led to his financial problems and \nhis criminal conduct.  He was assaulted by a neighbor in 2000 or 2001;  however, the \nneighbor was found not guilty.  Then Applicant was liable for hospital bills he could not \npay.  (TR 42-45; 82)  Applicant has not sought any financial counseling, but he intends \nto pay his bills when he can afford to do so.  Currently, he pays a substantial amount of \nmoney for child support and supports three households, so has no discretionary money \nleft to pay any delinquent debts. (TR 52-53; 68-72) \n \n            Applicant admitted the criminal conduct alleged in 2.a. to 2.e.  (Answer; TR 75-\n77; 89-95; 100) At the hearing Applicant admitted allegations 2.f. (a misdemeanor \ntrespassing offense), 2.g. (open container of alcohol while driving), 2.h. (assault and \nbattery on a family member), 2.i. (failure to obey a court order to complete a domestic \nviolence prevention program), 2.j. (driving with no liability insurance), 2.k. (habitual \noffender), 2.l. (threatening bodily harm, charge dismissed), and 2.m. (loud music \u2013 \nvehicle).   (TR 78-88)  Later, Applicant completed the domestic violence prevention \nprogram.  (TR 84-85) \n \nApplicant did not fully understand the form or the security clearance process and \ncould not remember dates.  He denied allegations 3.a. as he did not have a felony \nconviction, 3.b. as he was trying to \u201cblock it out\u201d and forget the past arrests, and 3.c., \nbut he admitted allegation 3.d. that he falsified his SF 86 by not revealing his financial \ndelinquencies over 90 days late.  (Answer; TR 96-99; 101-106)  He forgot a lot of the \ndetails. No one in is security office explained the significance of the form.  His word is \nhis bond.  He did not intend to falsify his SF 86. (TR 106-110) \n \nApplicant now has a stable job and a good relationship with his fianc\u00e9.  Since he \nhas been with her for the past five years he has straightened out his life. He and she are \nworking together to study for and pass the GED because he wants to advance himself \nat work.  Although he was labeled a habitual offender in 1996, and lost his driver\u2019s \nlicense, he got his license back recently as his company paid his past traffic fines.  (TR \n48-49; 95-96) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nPolicies \n \n            Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy \ncondition is not decisive.   \n \n            Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I \nweighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and determined the following \nsecurity concern was relevant to my determination: \n \nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern caused by financial problems is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation.  \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial \ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n            The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \napplicant's access to classified information. Then the applicant may present evidence to \nrefute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive \nOrder 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an \napplicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do \nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial \noverall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those \ninferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of \nrecord.   \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an \nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nloyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.3 It is merely an indication that the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a security clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n      \n            The government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nreflecting debts of approximately $9,000 to fifteen creditors for two judgments and other \ndebts.   Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition, AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply. His financial problems are sufficiently significant to raise \nsecurity concerns. \n \n            With the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case \nagainst him.  \n \n            Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \n3 Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \n            AG \u00b6 20(a) partially applies4 because his financial problems \u201coccurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur,\u201d however his continuing financial \nproblems \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He \nfell behind on his bills because of domestic turbulence and his requirement to provide \nsupport for children in three households.  He, however, did not provide any evidence \nthat he is now paying the bills on time.  He does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) \nbecause he will continue to be under financial stress until he is able to develop and \nimplement a plan to resolve these debts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that security concerns may be mitigated when, \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nAs discussed above, Applicant\u2019s financial issues resulted from a series of domestic \nproblems. However, he failed to demonstrate how he \u201cacted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d He will receive credit in the Formal Findings for paying some of his \ndebts through garnishment of his wages.  Again, he failed to provide evidence that he \nhas developed a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent debts.  He receives partial \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(b).   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as he has not met with a financial advisor and has no \nintent to do so.  Only a few SOR alleged debts are paid, and he provided no budget or \nplan to demonstrate these financial problems are under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part because he \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort\u201d to repay some \nof the overdue creditors by wage garnishment.  While he did not fully document the \ndebts paid through wage garnishment, I accept his testimony that those judgment debts \nhave been or are being resolved.  However, the majority of the other debts remain \nunresolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies in part as Applicant did \u201cdispute the legitimacy\u201d of some \nof the past-due debt where he testified credibly he did not know certain creditors or \nrecognize certain debts.  Moreover, the government did not meet it\u2019s initial burden on \nthe debts he disputed by establishing the legitimacy of those debts.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant credibly described his sincere hope that he wanted to resolve \nhis remaining delinquent debts. However, he provided no plan as to how he might do so \neven though he was provided an opportunity to submit post-hearing documents.  He \nreceives credit in the Formal Findings for those debts he paid or is paying through \ngarnishment.  He also receives credit for those debts the government failed to establish.  \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes security concerns about criminal conduct, \u201c[c]riminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \n \n4 See generally ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under \nthe good faith mitigating condition for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in Appellant\u2019s case: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and, \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nAppellant has a series of misdemeanor arrests that include both traffic offenses \nand domestic violence issues in the turbulent relationship with his wife from who is now \nseparated.  Many of the cases were dismissed, or in others he paid a fine.  For his \nfailure to complete his domestic violence prevention course, he served time in weekend \nconfinement.  He had so many arrests and convictions that in April 2003 he was \nconvicted of being a Habitual Offender and fined. 5 \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nFor many of the allegations that occurred in the 1990 to 2000 time frame and for \nminor offenses Appellant falls within AG \u00b6 32(a) as so much time has elapsed since \nthese misdemeanors occurred or in other cases the charges were dismissed.  Also, \nthere were special mitigating and unusual circumstances in his domestic dispute with \nhis wife. He eventually completed the Domestic Violence Prevention program.  To his \ncredit his driver\u2019s license is no longer suspended.  However, his conviction in 2003 for \nbeing a Habitual Offender, as well as his 2006 traffic offense, and a 2006 arrest for \nthreatening bodily harm (a charge that was dismissed) raise a red flag of concern \nbecause of either recency or seriousness.6  While Applicant claims that he has \n \n5 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n6 I have determined that most of the criminal conduct is mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c) because it \nhappened so long ago or under unique conditions (Applicant no longer lives in the household where the \ndomestic violence occurred), and as such the conduct is unlikely to recur. However, the SOR conduct in  \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nns persist. \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nreformed his conduct that led to these criminal incidents, he provided no evidence \noutside his own testimony of his rehabilitation.  Thus, concer\n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct raises security concerns stating, \n\u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 has two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern in \nthis case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nWith respect to the four omissions from his SF 86, his failing to reveal his arrests \nand his financial problems is a security concern.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply.  \n \nOn the other hand, AG \u00b6 17 details seven conditions that could mitigate personal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n2 cannot be considered piecemeal. The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and \nreach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When his 2003 \nhabitual offender misconduct is considered in connection with the 2006 offenses, the criminal conduct in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j to 2.m cannot be mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c). The misconduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j to 2.m continues \nto cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c) and 17(f) are the mitigating conditions that partially or fully \napply. Appellant disclosed his arrests when he was interviewed as those arrests were \nthe subject of an Amended SOR. Through this disclosure, he eliminated any possibility \nthat his omissions could be used to coerce or threaten him.  Given his limited education, \nhis statement is credible that he did not fully understand the security form and no one in \nthe security office explained the questions to him. The omissions \u201chappened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  He admits he knew about the \nfinancial issues, but did not know that he should provide the details.  In the future he will \ncarefully review security documents before he signs them and will not omit important \ninformation. His omissions from his SF 86 were careless, but not deliberate. He credibly \nestablished that he did not intend to falsify his SF 86 by these omissions. In sum, he did \nnot have any intent to deceive the government or security officials.  \n \nWhole Person \n \n            I considered the specific factors listed in AG \u00b6 2: \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence\u201d of the conduct at issue.   \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant has been a full time worker for eight years who has advanced at work \nand has been promoted to a supervisor.  He established that an unstable domestic \nsituation contributed to his financial issues and criminal conduct.  Having considered \nboth the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I conclude he is a \nsincere person.  However, he made insufficient efforts to reform his financial practices; \nand he is not yet on the road to financial recovery. While there is little potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress as he has stable employment, he has \nsubstantial debts and very limited resources.  In conclusion, financial issues do remain \na security concern. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations. \n \nSimilarly, he failed to fully establish a case of mitigation under Criminal Conduct \nas he was arrested for being a habitual offender in 2003, and his problems with arrests \nand convictions persisted into 2006. He did not show how he was been rehabilitated. \nHaving reviewed the guidelines and assessed him as a \u201cwhole person\u201d in order to \nevaluate Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests, I find \nAppellant has failed to mitigate all security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n       Applicant is 42 years old and works for a federal contractor. Since 2004, he accumulated a\nsignificant amount of debt that he has not paid or resolved. He did not mitigate the security concerns\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nraised by financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 10, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan.2, 1992), as\namended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March 30, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nthe revised adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nOn April 24, 2007, Applicant filed his Answer and elected to have the case decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. On June 4, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM), containing six Items, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on June 4, 2007.\nApplicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on June 12, 2007, and chose not to file any\nadditional information. The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old technician who works for a federal contractor. He began his\ncurrent position in August 2004. Prior to this job, he was unemployed for approximately one year.\nIn March 2005, he completed a SF-86. (Item 4). He subsequently received an interim security\nclearance. (Item 3).\nIn March 2007, the Government filed a SOR, alleging that Applicant has four delinquent\ndebts which total $15,0858. In his Answer, Applicant admitted owing the debts and stated that he\nwas unable to resolve them previously because of a period of unemployment. Although he is now\nemployed and is current with his obligations, his salary is insufficient to repay the debts. (Item 3).\nIn his October 2006 statement, he acknowledged that because he was unable to pay the delinquent\ndebts, they were charged off by the creditors. He never negotiated a repayment plan for them. (Item\n6). A budget that he submitted with the statement indicated that he was making monthly payments\non three different obligations, and had very little money left after paying all of his expenses. (Id. at\n4). A March 2007 credit report confirms that his financial problems began in 2004. (Item 5). \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the Guidelines are\ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to\ndetermine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. The\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about an applicant\u2019s\nloyalty. Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 7. Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988). The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any\ndisqualifying conditions and an applicant's present security suitability. ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at\n2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient\nto overcome the position of the Government. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n4\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and after application of the appropriate\nadjudicative factors and pertinent legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nGuideline 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cFailure\nto live within one\u2019s means and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is a risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit report, the Government\nraised a security concern under two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions: Guideline\n\u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations). Since 2004, Applicant has a history of being unable to meet his financial obligations.\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifications, the\nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence of mitigation. Four Financial Considerations\nMitigating Conditions are potentially applicable under this Guideline. Because Applicant\u2019s financial\ntroubles began in approximately 2004 and continue to the present, Guideline \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose as a result of a period of\nunemployment, which triggers the application of Guideline \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in\nthe behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances). However, Applicant did not produce any evidence\nindicating that he took steps to manage his debts during his unemployment, which is necessary for\nthe full application of this mitigating condition.\nGuideline \u00b6 20 (c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) is not applicable.\nApplicant has not participated in counseling for his financial difficulties or provided information that\nthe problems are resolved or under control. In addition, Applicant admitted that he has not taken\nsteps to resolve the debts, which is necessary for application of Guideline \u00b6 20(d) (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Directive. Applicant\nis 42 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his obligations. His decision not to\naddress any of the delinquent debts (including a $41 telephone debt) when he learned in October\n\n5\n2006 of the Government\u2019s concerns, demonstrates a lack of good judgment. While I recognize the\nimpact that a year-long period of unemployment could have on one\u2019s financial status, his decision\nto abandon his obligations without contacting his creditors, especially after he secured employment,\nalso exhibited a lack of reliability. Until he establishes a budget, documentinsa repayment plan, and\nestablishes a track record of consistent financial management, I am concerned that he will continue\nhaving financial difficulties, despite assertions to the contrary.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the facts in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial\nconsiderations. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified\ninformation at this time.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleged security\nconcerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal Conduct), and J\n(Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, admitted all the allegations in the\nSOR, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department\nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on May 21, 2007. A complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received the FORM on June 6, 2007, but did not respond.

Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.\n\n5\nA disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b619(a) and (c).\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive\nprongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d\nor \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of the\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent credit card debt was charged off in September 2001, almost six years\nago.  He has not presented any evidence concerning the circumstances under which the debt was\nincurred.  It is the only delinquent debt alleged in the SOR; however, his credit reports reflect three\nother instances of allowing debts to be charged off before satisfying them.  Uncharged misconduct\nmay be considered \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence\nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has\ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).  I have considered the\nuncharged delinquent debts for the limited purpose of determining whether the mitigating condition\nin AG 20(a) is established.  Applicant\u2019s financial history shows a track record of allowing debts to\nbe charged off before paying them.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) is not\nestablished.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).  The\nconcept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness,\nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL\n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the debt for more than four\nyears after it was charged off and more than three years after he began working for his current\nemployer reflects lack of prudence and a diminished sense of obligation.  I conclude this mitigating\ncondition is not established.  No other mitigating conditions under this guideline are relevant.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n6\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15. The relevant\ndisqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).  Based Applicant\u2019s admission of\nfalsification, I conclude the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance application\nmay be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a).\nApplicant made no effort to correct his falsifications until he answered the SOR.  Neither AG \u00b6 17(a)\nnor any other mitigating condition is established.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30.  Conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(a).\nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to\nknowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the\nUnited States.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  Security clearances are matters within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive branch of the government of the United States.  A deliberately false answer on a security\nclearance application is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.  Applicant\u2019s false\nanswers on his security clearance application raise the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(a), shifting\nthe burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 32(a).  Applicant\u2019s falsification was recent, occurring on his current security\nclearance application, and there is no evidence of \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d  I conclude that neither\nthis mitigating condition nor any others under this guideline are established.\n\n7\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors are incorporated in the above discussion of Guidelines F, E, and\nJ, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult.  His lack of candor and absence of any persuasive excuse raises\ngrave doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, E, and J, and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on financial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  Accordingly, I conclude\nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nhim a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She immigrated to the U.S. in 1997 from Iran and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\n2003. She considers herself a dual citizen of Iran and the U.S. and intends on renewing her passport\nin the future so she can travel to Iran. Her parents and sisters are also dual citizens residing in the\nU.S. She has many relatives and friends that she maintains regular and frequent contact with in Iran.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline C for foreign preference\nand Guideline B for foreign influence. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline B for foreign influence and\nGuideline C for foreign preference.\nIn a sworn statement dated September 13, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand admitted all the allegations under both guidelines. Applicant elected to have her case decided\non the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material\n(FORM) on March 14, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on March 15, 2007, and received\non March 21, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not provide additional information. The case\nwas assigned to me on May 24, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 28 years old and has worked for a federal contractor as a sales associate since\n1999. She is single and has a college degree. She was born in Iran and immigrated to the U.S. in\n1997, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003. Applicant considers herself a dual citizen of\nIran and the U.S. and possesses an Iranian passport that was due to expire in December 1996. She\nstated in her security clearance application: \u201cI have this passport because I am a born citizen of Iran.\nI will only use this passport when I have to visit my relatives in Iran.\u201d  Applicant was provided with\n2\na copy of the \u201cMoney Memo.\u201d  Applicant stated in interrogatories that she intends to renew and/or\n3\n\nItem 5 at 6.\n4\nItem 3.\n5\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Humans Right and Labor, Country Report on Human Rights\n6\nPractices-2005, dated March 8, 2006, (Report on Human Rights Practices)at 1; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of\nConsular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet: Iran Dated April 3, 2006.\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Background Note: Iran, Dated October 2006\n7\n(Background Note) at 7.\nPresident of the United States, The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, dated March\n8\n2006 (President\u2019s National Security Strategy) at 20.\n3\nobtain an Iranian passport in the future.  She has not surrendered her Iranian passport. She\n4\naffirmatively stated she is not willing to renounce her dual citizenship with Iran. She traveled to Iran\nin 2002 using her Iranian passport, but at that time she was not yet a U.S. citizen and would have had\nno other choice. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, sister, and uncle are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran and reside\nin the U.S. Another uncle and three cousins are citizens and residents of Iran. She has one cousin\nwho is a citizen of Iran and resides in the United Arab Emirates; three cousins, an uncle and aunt\nwho are citizens and residents of Italy; a cousin and friend who are citizens of Iran and reside in the\nUnited Kingdom; a friend who is a citizen of Iran and resides in Canada; and a friend who is a citizen\nand resident of Iran. Applicant checked a box saying her personal contact or correspondence with\neach person listed above was casual and infrequent, excluding her parents and sister. She described\nthe frequency of the contact with the listed persons, excluding her parents and sister as monthly or\na few times a year, by -email or telephone. She provided no other information about the status of her\nrelationship with each person and what type of personal, familial, social or emotional obligation she\nhas with each person. One friend and a cousin whom she contacts monthly are citizens and residents\nof Iran and are students. Others are employed in various positions. She provided no information\nabout her contact and relationship with her parents and sister. No information was provided as to\nhow often her parents and sister return to Iran or what type of family, financial, or other interests they\nmaintain there or whether they have any contact with the Iranian government.\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran. She provides charitable financial support to\n\u201cneedy children\u201d in Iran to support their education.5\nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in which\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is vested in\na learned religious scholar.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.  The\n6\n7\nPresident\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated that the United States \u201cmay face no greater\nchallenge from a single country than from Iran.\u201d8\nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as:\n\u2022\nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\n(WMD);\n\u2022\nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism;\n\nBackground Note at 8; U.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Country\n9\nReports on Terrorism-2005, dated April 2006, (Reports on Terrorism) at 21.\nReports on Terrorism at 171 and 173.\n10\nReports on Human Rights Practices.\n11\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Travel Warning: Iran, dated October 10, 2006.\n12\n4\n\u2022\nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; \n\u2022\nIts dismal human rights record; and\nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.9\nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\nIran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups.  \n10\nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the\nIranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, including\nof minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention, including\nprolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe restrictions on civil liberties - speech,\npress, assembly, association, movement and privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion;\nofficial corruption; violence and legal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and\nreligious minorities, and homosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n11\nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel\nto Iran. The children of Iranian citizens are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since\nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. As a result, U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained\nand harassed by the Iranian government.  \n12\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n13\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n13\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n15\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n16\ndecision.  \n17\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n18\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n19\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n20\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n21\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline C-Foreign Preference is a security concern because when an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nGuideline B-Foreign Influence is a concern because a security risk may exist when an\nindividual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be\nbound by affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject\nto duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interest\nin other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\n\n6\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I reach the\nfollowing conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1\n(The exercise of dual citizenship) and FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2 (Possession and/or use of a foreign\npassport) apply. Applicant was born in Iran and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She has in her\npossession an Iranian passport that although expired, she intends on renewing and using it in the\nfuture to travel to Iran. She was provided a copy of the \u201cMoney Memo\u201d and has chosen to retain her\npassport. She considers herself a dual citizen and intends on exercising her dual status through use\nof her passport. The possession and/or use of a foreign passport is an exercise of dual citizenship.\nBoth of the above disqualifying conditions apply.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Preference\nMitigating Condition (FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.1 (Dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship\nor birth in a foreign country, FP MC E2.A3.1.3.2 (Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g.\nforeign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship) and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4\n(Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship),and conclude none apply.\nApplicant has in her possession her Iranian passport that she intends on renewing and using in the\nfuture. This is an exercise of dual citizenship that is based on her affirmative actions, vice her parents\ncitizenship or her birth in a foreign country. She retained the passport after becoming a U.S. citizen\nand intends on doing so again. Thus, both FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1 and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.2 do not apply.\nApplicant is unwilling to renounce her Iranian citizenship, so this mitigating condition can not be\napplied. Under the \u201cMoney Memo\u201d Applicant\u2019s retention of her Iranian passport and intentions of\nrenewing it and using it in the future precludes her from obtaining a security clearance. I find under\nthe above analysis she has failed to mitigate the foreign preference concerns.\nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1\n(An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or\nobligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) applies. Applicant parents and\nsister are immediate family members who are dual citizens of Iran and the U.S. Applicant maintains\nregular monthly contact with various relatives and friends in Iran, and regular but less contact with\nothers.\nI have considered FI DC E2.A2.1.3.8 (A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any\nforeign-owned or-operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.)\nApplicant\u2019s monetary support to \u201cneedy children\u201d in Iran is characterized as a charitable contribution\nand not a financial interests. There is no evidence she has a financial interest in the organization.\nTherefore, this disqualifying condition does not apply.\n\n7\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Influence\nMitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (A determination that the immediate family member(s)\n(spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question\nare not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that\ncould force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States),\nand FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2 (Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and\ninfrequent), and I conclude they do not apply. Applicant\u2019s immediate family to include her parents\nand sister are dual citizens of Iran and the U.S. No information was provided as to what type of\nrelationship or contact she has with her parents and sister. No information was provided as to what\ntheir contact is with relatives in Iran, how often they travel to that country, whether they receive\ngovernment support and other relevant information. Insufficient information was provided to\ndetermine that they do not have connections to the Iranian government or are not in a position to be\nexploited by Iran in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to her family and the\nU.S. Therefore, I find FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1 does not apply. It is presumed that her ties with her\nimmediate family are more than casual and infrequent. However, without additional information\nabout her personal relationships and ties to her other relatives and friends in Iran and elsewhere, it\ncannot be presumed that it is casual and infrequent. Applicant carries the burden of providing factual\ninformation about the ties she has to these people and has failed to do so. I find FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2\ndoes not apply.\nThe nature of the country in this case, Iran, is an important factor based on its past history of\nexploiting its citizens and those that are legally in its country. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has\nfailed to meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns raised by the foreign preference and foreign\ninfluence  concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly,\nGuideline C and Guideline B are decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nForeign Influence (Guideline B)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a-m\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2\nForeign Preference (Guideline C)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2. d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol. G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He ceased his active use of drugs in 1995. In the last 11 years, he smoked\nmarijuana twice and improperly used over the counter legal substances a few times, the last time in\nearly 2003. He has remained drug free for over four years. He did not falsify his answers about his\ndrug use when he completed his security clearance application in January 2003, nor did he\nintentionally withhold information about his past drug use in his 2003 interview with a National\nSecurity Agency investigator. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his drug\ninvolvement and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the\ncase be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked. On January 6, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the\nallegations. He requested a hearing.\nThis matter was assigned to me on January 17, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 22, 2007, and I held a hearing on March 29, 2007. The government submitted five exhibits\n(GE), which were marked and admitted into evidence as GE 1-5 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted 14 exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted into evidence as App Ex A-N\nwithout objection. Applicant and three witness testified. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non April 11, 2007.1\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.m under\nGuideline H, and subparagraph 2.e under Guideline E.

He denied the remaining allegations under Guideline H and\nGuideline E.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I\n3\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, a single 33-year-old man, works as a software developer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He completed a security clearance application (SF-86) in January 2003 when he\napplied for a security clearance at the National Security Agency (NSA) and an electronic SF-86 in\nOctober 2005 for his current position.4\nWhile a 16-year-old high school student, Applicant started smoking marijuana with friends\nonce or twice a month. Between the ages of 19 and 22, he increased his use of marijuana\nsignificantly. He regularly purchased and smoked marijuana, sometimes a few times a day. During\nthis same period of time, he experimented with other drugs. He used cocaine once at age 17 and\nagain at age 19 or 20. He tried LSD 5-10 times over a period of 5 years, the last time in 1995 when\nhe was 22. He purchased hashish once and used the amount purchased on 4 occasions. He purchased\nand used psilocybin mushrooms twice, once in 1992 and again in 1993. In 1993, he purchased and\nused \u201cwet\u201d, a type of leaf treated with Angel Dust or PCP, about 10 times. Until age 20, he\noccasionally purchased and consumed morning glory seeds to get high. He stopped all his illegal\ndrug experimentation and regular use of marijuana in 1995, around the age of 22. At this time, he\nbegan to realize his involvement with illegal drugs was holding him back.5\nBetween 1996 and 2003, Applicant smoked marijuana twice, once in 1999 and again on\nDecember 15, 2002. Each time, he smoked marijuana at a friend\u2019s apartment during a social get\ntogether. He did not purchase any marijuana himself. He has not smoked marijuana since this time.\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, Applicant improperly used legal substances, at home, out of curiosity,\nlack of responsibility and foolishness. He purchased and drank a bottle of Robittusin, an over the\ncounter medication. He also purchased a second over the counter medication, Dexalone pills, on\nseveral occasions. He consumed 8 to10 pills at a time for the purpose of trying to get high. He also\npurchased salvia, a herb and legal substance, at a head shop. He did not experience any\nhallucinations when he used these drugs, but admits he wanted to get high. During this time, he\nmixed nutmeg with boiled milk, which he drank to relax. Applicant has not used any illegal drugs\nsince December 2002 and does not intend to do so in the future. Likewise, he has not experimented\nwith non-controlled substances for any reason. He no longer associates with individuals who use\ndrugs.  He has never been arrested for any conduct related to his drug abuse.\n6\n7\n\nId. at 44, 105-106.\n8\nGE 2, supra note 4, at 7; Tr. 50-52, 79-81.\n9\nGE 3 (NSA clearance decision) at 1-2; Tr. at 55-58, 70.\n10\n4\nFrom 1993 until 2000, Applicant attended a community college part-time and worked either\nfull-time or part-time. He received an Associate of Arts degree in computer science in 2000. From\nSeptember 2000 until December 2002, he attended a state university. He graduated in December\n2002 with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. He attributes his slow progress at the\ncommunity college to lack of ambition and his drug abuse.8\nUpon graduation from college, Applicant obtained a job with a contractor for NSA and\nstarted working on January 26, 2003. His job required that he obtain a Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI) security clearance as he did not have a security clearance. When he completed his\nSF-86 for his job, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the following question:\nQuestion 27 - Your use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs\nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever, is shorter, have\nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,\ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine,\nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,\ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription\ndrugs?\nHe listed marijuana and his dates of marijuana use from June 1990 until December 2002, noting that\nmost of his marijuana use occurred within the first seven years of this time period, and his one time\nuse in 1999 and again on December 15, 2002. He did not list any other drug use for the seven years\nprior to January 2003, nor did he list his use of non-controlled substances.9\nA NSA investigator interviewed Applicant on April 22, 2003. The investigator did not testify\nat the hearing, nor are any records from this interview part of the record. During the interview, the\ninvestigator reviewed each question on the SF-86 and Applicant\u2019s answer to each question.\nApplicant confirmed his answers to each question including Question 27. During this interview,\nApplicant told the investigator about his use of LSD on a few occasions prior to 1996. The\ninvestigator did not pursue this line of information any further.10\nIn September 2003, Applicant met with a NSA polygraph examiner. Prior to his polygraph\nexamination, Applicant and the polygraph examiner discussed the questions on the SF-86 and the\nquestions to be asked during his polygraph examination. During this meeting, the polygraph\nexaminer explained to Applicant that the scope of Question 27 included all his drug use. With this\nnew understanding, Applicant voluntarily advised the polygraph examiner about the extent of his\nillegal drug use since high school, and his inappropriate use of non-controlled, over-the-counter\nmedicines and other substances. The polygraph examiner did not testify at the hearing, nor are any\n\nGE 3, supra note 10, 1-2; Tr. at 59-60.\n11\nThe record contains no evidence which reflects that Applicant initiated his first SF-86 on this date.\n12\nGE 3, supra note 10, at 3-4; Tr. at 61-64, 67-70.\n13\nGE 4 (Applicant\u2019s March 11, 2004 letter of appeal) at 1-2; App Ex A (NSA letter with memo, dated May 6,\n14\n2004); GE 5 and App Ex B (NSA final denial of security clearance on appeal, dated November 5, 2004); Tr. at 46-47,\n68-70, 73-76.\n5\ndocuments related to this examination part of the record. Applicant stated that he passed the\npolygraph examination. There is no contradictory evidence of record.11\nSubsequent to his interview and polygraph examination, NSA issued a decision on\nApplicant\u2019s request for a clearance on February 11, 2004. Applying the standards set forth in the\nDirector of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/4, Annex C, for drug involvement and personal\nconduct and the whole person concept, NSA denied Applicant\u2019s SCI clearance request. After\nreviewing the facts of his case, NSA concluded that Applicant provided false and misleading\ninformation relative to his illegal drug use in his answers on his SF-86, and did not provide the full\nextent of his drug involvement in his April 2003 interview. NSA did not acknowledge the 7-year\nlimitation in Question 27, nor did it discuss or explain its conclusion that Applicant had not been\ntruthful in his answers to Question 27 when he did not reveal his past drug use that occurred more\nthan 7 years prior to the date he signed his SF-86. Although Applicant signed his first SF-86, which\nis dated January 27, 2003, on February 23, 2003, shortly after beginning his employment with a NSA\ncontractor and just after his college graduation in December 2002, NSA mistakenly concluded that\nApplicant originally dated his SF-86 on August 23, 2001.  NSA noted Applicant\u2019s intent to refrain\n12\nfrom any illegal drug use and the misuse of legal drugs. NSA, however, found that it had only been\neight months since Applicant\u2019s last reported use of a substance for the purpose of getting high. The\nNSA decision contains no indication as to how the facts reviewed were obtained. At the hearing,\nApplicant agreed  with the characterization of most of the facts concerning his drug use, but disputed\nthe accuracy of his marijuana use characterized in the decision.13\nApplicant appealed the denial of his clearance application to the NSA Access Appeals Panel\n(Panel) on March 11, 2004. In a memorandum dated, May 6, 2004, the NSA Chief of Adjudications\nindicated his decision to sustain the denial of Applicant\u2019s clearance, after reviewing and discussing\nall the information in their investigative file and Applicant\u2019s oral reply. He commended Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to refrain from the use of intoxicants; however, in light of the lengthy period of time\nApplicant had used illegal substances and over the counter substances, the NSA Chief believed\nApplicant needed a longer period of time to remain clean and sober. The NSA Chief did not discuss\nthe issue of falsification. NSA denied the appeal in a written decision dated November 4, 2004.  It\nadvised him that his company could sponsor him again in two years, if he had refrained from his past\nconduct. His employer terminated him in 2004 because he did not get his clearance.  \n14\nApplicant completed a second SF-86 on October 21, 2005. In response to Question a in\nSection 24, which is identical to Question 27 on his NSA application, he answered \u201cyes\u201d and\nprovided information regarding his use of marijuana in 1999 and 2002. He also stated that he would\n\nGE 1, supra note 4, at 24-25.\n15\nApp Ex F (Letter of recommendation, dated March 9, 2007) at 1-2; Tr. at 131-147.\n16\nApp Ex K (Letter of recommendation, dated March 15, 2007); Tr. at 48-49, 150-162.\n17\nApp Ex E (2006 performance appraisal); App Ex F, supra note 16; App Ex G (Letter of recommendation,\n18\ndated January 21, 2007); App Ex H (Letter of recommendation, dated January 28, 2007); App Ex I (Letter of\nrecommendation, dated January 21, 2007); App Ex J (Letter of recommendation, dated January 23, 2007); App Ex K,\nsupra note 17; App Ex L (Letter of recommendation, dated January 21, 2007); App Ex M (Letter of recommendation,\ndated February 12, 2007); App Ex N (Letter of recommendation, dated January 24, 2007); Tr. at 165-173.\nApp Ex C (Report of psychologist, dated March 14, 2007); App Ex D (Curriculum Vitae of psychologist).\n19\n6\nnot use it again in his lifetime. He did not mention his inappropriate use of non-controlled over-the-\ncounter medicines or substances.15\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a retired United States Air Force Lt. Colonel, testified on his behalf.\nHis interviewed and hired Applicant for his present position. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s past drug\nuse and the falsification charge because Applicant showed him the SOR. In the time Applicant has\nworked for him, he has not seen any indicators that Applicant has been under the influence of any\nsubstance. He described Applicant as having a very high work ethic and his work as high caliber.\nApplicant\u2019s peers and other supervisors think extremely well of him. Applicant is very forthright and\nnever deviates from workplace rules and policies. In his view, Applicant is a mature person, who is\nvery trustworthy and reliable. He recommends Applicant for a clearance.16\nApplicant\u2019s long-term girlfriend testified on his behalf. They met four years ago, while\nworking together at another company. She works as a principal contracting specialist for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor and holds a security clearance. She knows about Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity problems, as he gave her all the paperwork related to his security problems to review. She\nknows about his past drug use, which does not effect her opinion of him today. She has not seen any\nevidence of drug use in the house, including drug paraphernalia. Applicant does not associate with\nindividuals who use or experiment with drugs. She describes Applicant as one of the most honest\npeople she knows. He is a law abiding person and she has no reason to believe he is not telling her\nthe truth. She considers him responsible and dependable. When they worked together, Applicant\nfollowed company policies and regulations. She recommends him for a clearance.17\nA co-worker also testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Based on his past work relationship and\ncurrent friendship, he recommends Applicant for a security clearance. He has not seen any behavior\nwhich shows Applicant to be under the influence of drugs or with impaired judgment. The record\ncontains letters of recommendation from the three witnesses plus six other individuals, who are co-\nworkers, family, or friends. All consider Applicant trustworthy, dependable, responsible, and\nreliable. They uniformly agree that he is no longer involved with drugs, and that his past drug use\nis not reflective of the person they know. Applicant\u2019s 2006 performance appraisal rates his work\nperformance as significantly exceeds standards.18\nIn February 2007, a licensed psychologist evaluated and tested Applicant. Based on his\nexamination and testing, he declined to diagnosis any psychological or personality disorders or\nmedical problems.  He finds Applicant a highly intelligent man who appears to be free from\n19\n\nTo the extent that the psychologist and other witnesses have assessed Applicant\u2019s credibility, I have\n20\ndisregarded those credibility assessments and made my own independent credibility assessment of Applicant.\n7\npsychological disorder and substance abuse dependency or problems. He also emphasized it has been\nalmost five years since his last substance use, the significant change in his lifestyle and environment,\nand most significantly, his personal commitment to remain drug free, Applicant has matured and is\nfully capable of holding a position of trust. In reaching this conclusion, the psychologist credibly\ndescribed applicant\u2019s personality, environment and mental status, stating on pages 9-10 of his report:\nAccording to the personality testing, [Applicant] would appear to be well-\nfunctioning and highly invested in social conformity and sociability. He may go out\nof his way to adhere to the expectations of others, particularly those in positions of\nauthority. He has some resistance to any suggestion of psychological problems\nalthough he appears capable of accepting responsibility for his behavior and may\neven lapse into self-blame and self deprecation. He may project a sociable and easy-\ngoing style to others although he may experience more internal stress than he\ndemonstrates outwardly. He may also be inclined to put effort into avoiding or\ndownplaying any personal behaviors which could evoke ridicule or contempt from\nothers. He is likely to be hesitant about taking risks for fear of making mistakes or\nappearing unconventional.\nThese results substantiate [Applicant\u2019s] self-report that he believes much of\nhis earlier drug behavior was attributable to his environment and association with\nothers who used drugs. After starting his substance abuse as a teenager, he found\nhimself to be part of a sub-culture which was saturated with drugs and where drug\ntaking behavior was normative. His drug use during that time may have actually been\nless about his internal psychology or personal desire for drugs and more about his\ndrug-saturated environment. His personality, particularly when young, led him to go\nalong with the group rather than buck the trend and walk away; to some degree he\nwas trapped in a dysfunctional subculture. His personality profile, combined with the\nenvironment he now exists in, particularly as compared to the one he was in when he\nused drugs, would predict little risk taking, highly conventional behavior and full\nconformity with the law. In other words, he is highly unlikely to engage in drug\ntaking behavior at this point in his life.\nand on page 11:\nDuring [Applicant\u2019s] period of substance abuse, he was either an adolescent\nmale with no meaningful responsibilities or he was in a college environment with\nfew commitments or restrictions. His college environment was rife with drugs and\nhis mindset at the time was primarily that of having fun and avoiding responsibility.\nHe has now clearly matured into adulthood with awareness of appropriate behavior\nand law abiding behavior. He was able to fully describe the negative and destructive\ninfluences drugs can have on an individual and he appeared to genuinely express\nunderstanding of the high personal cost of drug use. [Applicant] has now fully\nmatured into adulthood and have developed meaningful life goals with attitudes,\nbeliefs and behaviors which preclude the use of drugs.20\n\nTr. at 41, 43-44, 122-123, 126-127.\n21\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n22\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n23\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n24\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Decision and Reversal Order, Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure\n27\n3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\nApplicant used drugs in his teens and early twenties because he had problems with his\nparents, a lack of responsibility, problems with social groups, lack of direction in his life, uncertainty\nabout his future, and youthful indiscretion. His inappropriate use of over the counter substances was\na lack of responsibility and foolish.21\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.22\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n23\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n24\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n25\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n26\nclearance decision.27\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n28\nId.\n29\nId.; Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n30\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n31\nDrug abuse is defined in AG \u00b6 24(a)(1)-(2) to include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\n32\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. AG \u00b6 24(b) also defines drug abuse as the illegal use of\na drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\n9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n28\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n29\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n30\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n31\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nDrug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.32\n(AG \u00b6 24) Applicant used marijuana on a regular basis from approximately 1990 until 1995. During\nthis same period of time, he experimented with a variety of illegal drugs, including cocaine, LSD\npsilocybin mushrooms, and hashish. Since 1995, he smoked marijuana twice, and in 2002, used\nseveral legal substances for the purpose of attempting to get high. Based on the evidence of record,\nDC \u00b6 25 (a) any drug abuse; and DC \u00b6 25 (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution apply.\nMC \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment applies. As a teenager and young man, Applicant\nsmoked marijuana on a regular and frequent basis. He also experimented with a variety of illegal\ndrugs, but did not become addicted to any of these drugs. Over time, he realized the negative effect\nhis drug use was having on his life. He decided to cease his drug use and did in 1995. Since 1996,\nhe has smoked marijuana twice, on social occasions, the last time being in December 2002. Recently,\na licensed psychologist interviewed and tested Applicant. The psychologist declined to diagnose any\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n33\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\npsychological or personality disorders. He concluded that Applicant was not drug dependent and that\ngiven Applicant\u2019s personality and significant change in work and personal environments, there is\nlittle likelihood that he would become involved with drugs in the future. His supervisor, co-workers,\nfamily, and friends know about his past drug use. All agree that he is trustworthy, dependable,\nreliable, and honest. Given that he ceased his heavy drug use over 11 years ago and he twice used\nmarijuana in the last 11 years, as well as the psychological evaluation and recommendations, his\nillegal drug use is not likely to reoccur.\nMC \u00b626(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used;. and (3) an appropriate period of abstinence applies. Since 2003, Applicant\nhas stated an intent not to use illegal drugs or any other substances improperly. He has kept his word.\nHe has stayed completely away from using illegal drugs and the improper use of other substances.\nHe no longer associates with people who use drugs, choosing instead to spend time with his\ngirlfriend and new friends from work. He has changed his entire life style from one of a drug culture\nand irresponsibility to a responsible adult life. He goes to work every day and performs his duties\nexceptionally well. His supervisor and co-workers view him as reliable and dependable, as does his\ngirlfriend. He has a very conventional lifestyle, which is not conducive to drug use. Applicant has\nmitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his illegal drug involvement and improper use of legal\nsubstances.\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b61.i that Applicant mixed nutmeg and boiled milk in order\nto hallucinate, but has not established that one can hallucinate from this mixture. Applicant has\nadmitted to drinking this mixture to relax, but not to experiencing hallucinations. In SOR \u00b61.l, the\ngovernment alleged that Applicant used the herb salvia, a legal substance, for the illegal purpose of\nhallucinating. Applicant denied any hallucinogenic affect and the government provided no evidence\nthat use of this herb caused hallucinations, as alleged. Guideline H is found in favor of Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance. (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant denied that he deliberately\nfalsified his answer to Question 27 by omitting his drug use between 1989 and 1995. He argues that\nhe answered the question as asked, and listed his drug use for the seven years prior to the date of the\nhis SF-86. When a falsification is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof\nof an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind\nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole\nto determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment,\n33\nor falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . to apply,\n\n11\nthe government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer\nwas deliberate.\nApplicant began answering the questions on his 2003 SF-86 on January 27, 2003 at the age\nof 29. He completed and signed it on February 23, 2003. Question 27 asked about his drug use from\nage 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever was shorter. Since Applicant was 29 years old, he properly\nlisted his drug use for the last 7 years or back until January 1996, when he was 22. He listed his\nmarijuana use and included the full dates of his use. NSA based its finding of falsification on an\nincorrect application date. Applicant did not initiate his SF-86 on August 23, 2001. In August 2001,\nApplicant worked at the university he attended and had no need of a security clearance for his\nposition. He did not begin his employment with the NSA contractor until late January 2003, about\na month after his college graduation. Because the NSA falsification finding is based on an incorrect\ndate and his answer is factually correct, the falsification finding is entitled to no weight. Applicant\ntruthfully answered Question 27. Allegation 2.a under Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nConcerning allegation 2.b, the government has not established that Applicant deliberately\nwithheld information from a government investigator during his April 2003 interview for the NSA\nclearance. Applicant credibly testified about the interview process, which he described as the\ninterviewer reviewing the SF-86 questions and his answers. He also stated that he raised his LSD\nexperimentation with the interviewer who did not ask more questions regarding this issue. The NSA\ndecision discusses his factual admission about LSD use. It does not discuss how this fact was\nrevealed in the interview or how its conclusion that Applicant did not reveal the full extent of his\ndrug use during his 2003 interview is supported by the evidence in its record. Thus, the NSA\ndecision does not refute Applicant\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, the record lacks any evidence which\nsupports this allegation and the NSA finding. Allegation 2.b under Guideline E is found in favor of\nApplicant.\nConcerning allegations 2.c and 2.d, the issues raised in these allegations were also alleged\nunder Guideline H and were mitigated under this guideline. They would bemitigated under Guideline\nE for the same reasons. Allegation 2.e. correctly alleges that NSA denied Applicant a security\nclearance in part because it found that Applicant falsified his past drug use. Question 27 on\nApplicant\u2019s 2003 SF-86 asked him to reveal his drug use for the past 7 years, and he did. Given my\nconclusion that NSA based its finding that Applicant falsified his answer to this question on an\nincorrect date and the lack of evidentiary support for NSA\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to\nreveal the full extent of his drug use in his April 2003 interview, I find that the government has not\nestablished its case or that Applicant mitigated the adverse information. Guideline E is found in\nfavor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof his acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\n\n12\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nAs a teenager and young man, Applicant experimented with numerous drugs, many of which\nwere potentially habit forming and dangerous to him. Of all the drugs he tried, he used only\nmarijuana on a regular and frequent basis. By age 22, he realized that his drug use was having a\nnegative impact on his life. He ceased his regular use of marijuana. Over the next six years he\nsmoked marijuana twice more. In all the years he smoked marijuana and experimented with other\nmore addictive drugs, the police never arrested and charged him with any drug related crimes. Thus,\nthe information about his past drug use came solely from him. His decision to experiment with over\nthe counter medicines and salvia in 2002 after a long absence from drug experimentation raises a\nconcern about his judgment at that time. However, since graduating from college and entering the\nbusiness world, he has changed his behavior and attitude completely. His friends and colleagues\nview him as responsible, dependable and reliable. He has a good work ethic and is very respected\nat work for his skills and abilities. He has developed a long-term personal relationship. His goals are\nmuch different now. He has direction in his life and has chosen to stay away from his past drug\nfriends and environment.\nNSA denied him a SCI clearance because of his past drug use. NSA advised that he could\nreapply for a clearance in two years, if he remained drug free. It has been more than two years since\nNSA\u2019s decision. Applicant has kept his word and remained drug free for more than four years. This\nfact is corroborated by a psychologist, who refused to diagnose any psychological or personality\ndisorders, and concluded that Applicant did not have any drug dependancy.\nNSA also concluded that he falsified information on his SF-86 about his past drug use by\nusing an erroneous initial date for his SF-86. NSA\u2019s conclusion on falsification is not supported by\nthe evidentiary record and this conclusion is entitled to no weight because his answer was not false.\nApplicant truthfully answered the question about his past illegal drug use when he completed his SF-\n86 in 2003 and again in 2005. The SF-86 does not ask any questions about the improper use of non-\ncontrolled or over the counter substances.\nApplicant broke the rules against use of an illegal drugs as a teenage and young man. He\nrecognized the error of his ways and corrected both his attitude and his conduct. I have carefully\nweighed the mitigating factors, the totality of the circumstances surrounding his decision to smoke\nmarijuana and experiment with numerous illegal drugs, his honesty in revealing this information, his\nwork ethic, his change in attitude and life style, and his present relationships against the seriousness\nof his misconduct. I have concluded that he would not act in a manner which would harm the\ngovernment. There is little likelihood he could be pressured, coerced, exploited, or subjected to\nduress for his past conduct. He has matured and developed a conventional, drug free life style. There\nis little likelihood that his drug use would occur in the future. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns pertaining to his drug involvement and his personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n13\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline H :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-m: \nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-e: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 25, 2004, Applicant signed and completed an application for a position of public\ntrust, an ADP I/II/III position, which he resigned on October 4, 2004 and submitted. The Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement\n1\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the\nadministrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). DOHA recommended the case be referred to\nan administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked. On October 16, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to\nthe allegations. He requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on April 18, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on May 17,\n2007. Since Applicant received the hearing notice on May 23, 2007, which was less than 15 days\nbefore the hearing scheduled for June 5, 2007, Applicant waived his right to receive the notice of the\nhearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The government\n2\nsubmitted six exhibits (GE) which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6, without\nobjection. Applicant submitted seven exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App\nEx A-G, without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I held the record open for Applicant\nto submit additional evidence, which he did not do.

In February\n1999, he enlisted in the United States Army. During the two and one-half years he served in the\nArmy, he received counterintelligence training and obtained other college credits. He held a top secret\nclearance. The Army awarded him two Army Achievement Medals, two NATO Medals for Service,\nan Army Commendation Medal, and several certificates of appreciation or achievements. The Army\nhonorably discharged him because of a disability in October 2001. The Veterans Administration (VA)\ndetermined that he has a 30% service connected disability due to migraine headaches. Upon his\ndischarge from the military, Applicant worked temporary jobs until he obtained his current job.\nApplicant is married and has a 4-year-old daughter.5\nA review of Appellant\u2019s credit reports dated October 13, 2004, May 9, 2006, March 28, 2007,\nand the SOR shows 10 unpaid debts totaling $15,816.  The current status of these debts is as follows:\n6\nSOR \u00b6\nAccount/ Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a.\nCredit card           $11,603\nUnpaid, Statute of\nLimitations\n1.b.\nStore account            $160\nUnpaid, Statute of\nLimitations\n1.c.\nCredit card                $285\nNot listed in credit\nreports; Statute of\nLimitations\nGE 4, GE 5, GE 6.\n1.d.\nRental account       $1,035\nDisputed; Statute of\nLimitations\nApp Ex A\n1.e.\nCollection account $1,027\nUnpaid, Statute of\nLimitations; Disputed,\nthen admitted\nGE 5, p. 2; GE 6, p 2; Tr. at\n42.\n\nApp Ex A (Renewal rental agreement dated October 1, 2001, collection bill dated April 18, 2002, and rental\n7\napplication dated March 4, 2001); App Ex B (Letter dated April 11, 2002); Tr. at 27-28, 36-40.

They renewed the lease on October 1, 2001 for another 6 months at a rent of $544 a\nmonth. On April 1, 2002, they became month-to-month tenants. Because of vandalism problems in\nthe apartment complex, they gave their notice to vacate around April 5, 2002. They directed their\ndeposit of approximately $400 be used to pay any remaining rent. The apartment complex then sent\nthem an eviction notice. They moved on April 15, 2002. On April 18, 2002, the apartment complex\nsent him a bill for $1,035.92. The bill reflected a monthly rent of $619 and a month to month fee of\n$75, amounts not shown on the renewal lease. The apartment complex determined Applicant owed\n$330 for rent from April 5, 2002 through May 5, 2002 and a $40 month-to-month fee, plus $75 for\nmiscellaneous, unspecified damages, $105 for a late fee, and $486 for a reletting fee. The bill did not\nreflect how the security deposit was applied. The apartment complex noted that no rent had been paid\nfor April 2002, which conflicts with their rent payment request for the month of April 5, 2002 through\nMay 5, 2002; that the unit was dirty; and that if the bill was not paid in 10 days, a file would be sent\nto collections. The apartment complex never filed a law suit; however, upon receipt of the eviction\nnotice, Applicant wrote to a local judge about his problems with the apartment complex and sent a\ncopy to the apartment complex. No court action took place nor is the eviction notice part of the\nrecord.7\nAs young adults, Applicant and his wife purchased furniture with a credit card. The largest\nunpaid debt in the SOR is for this furniture. He estimated the total debt at $6006, not $11,603 balance\nreflect in the credit reports. The additional charges may represent fees and interests accrued over time\non this cancelled credit card. He acknowledged the unpaid bill in allegation 1.b. He paid much of the\nindebtedness he incurred with this creditor, but didn\u2019t fully pay the bill because he needed the money\nto pay other expenses. His credit reports reflect that he disputed the debts in allegations 1.e, 1.g. and\n1.i, although he admitted owing the unpaid debt at the hearing.  \n8\nHe denies the debt in allegation 1.c., which is a military credit card. None of the credit reports\nof record show a debt in this amount; rather the reports reflect a zero balance in his military credit\n\nSOR response, supra note 3; Tr. at 26, 42-43, 51-53.\n9\nGE 3 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated June 10, 2005), at 11; GE 5, supra note 6; GE 6, supra note 6; Tr. at 51.\n10\nGE 1, supra note 4, at 7; Tr. at 57-58, 59-61.\n11\nGE 3, supra note 10, at 3; Tr. at 25-26.\n12\n Department of the Navy v.

He also\ndenies the allegation in 1.f, stating that he paid this account through a collection agency, he had hired\nto help resolve his debt issues. For 8 months, he made monthly payments to the agency for the\npurpose of resolving the debts in allegations 1.e and 1.f. He has not provided any evidence to show\npayment or an agreement with a collection agency.9\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly salary in 2005 totaled $1,908 and his net monthly income totaled\n$1,622. His monthly expenses in 2005 totaled $1,421, leaving $201 for repayment of debt. At the\nhearing, he advised that he now receives $420 a month in disability benefits from the VA. He timely\npays his current bills and has not incurred additional new, unpaid debts. He and his wife recently\npurchased a house.10\nWhen Applicant completed his SF-85P on the afternoon of August 25, 2004 at work, he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 22b, which asked if he \u201cwas now over 180 days delinquent on any loan\nor financial obligation?\u201d In his response to the SOR, he stated he thought the question asked for debts\nnot listed on form (this form is unidentified). At the hearing, he acknowledged that he knew he had\ndebts when he completed the form. He may have been careless and he did not think his debts were\nserious.11\nAt the hearing and in his 2005 written statement, Applicant asserted that he concentrated on\npaying his wife\u2019s debts first. He further stated that when her debts were paid, he would start paying\nhis debts. He has provided no documentary evidence which shows that he paid her debts. Likewise,\nthe record contains no evidence of his current work performance.12\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for determining trustworthiness within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a trustworthiness determination, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n14\n Id.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n20\n6\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a trustworthiness determination.  An\n14\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the\n15\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of\nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.16\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.17\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n18\nwith the national interest to grant eligibility for a position of public trust.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n19\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n20\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant incurred significant,\nunpaid debt as a teenager and in his early twenties. Because of his income, he lacked the ability to\nmake the monthly payments on his numerous credit cards. He still has outstanding bills from this\nconduct. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (A history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napply.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n21\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nI considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and conclude\nthat FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (It was an isolated\nincident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) do not apply because the debts remain unpaid, are not\nrecent, and are not the result of events or behavior beyond his control. Applicant has not made any\nefforts to resolve these debts.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies in part. As\na very young adult, Applicant obtained credit to purchase items for which he did not have cash. With\neveryday living expenses, he got behind in his payments, and eventually stopped making payments\non some of his debt. Other debts he regularly and timely paid. He challenged several debts listed on\nhis credit report because he did not believe he owed the debts. Of the debts challenged, his evidence\nestablishes that the debt he is alleged to owe for back rent in 2002 may not be legitimate because the\nnotification of monies due and owing from the apartment complex conflicts with the rent monies due\nas set out in the renewal lease. In addition, since the apartment complex purposely chose not to pursue\nits legal right, but to harm Applicant\u2019s credit, a serious question arises about the legitimacy of many\nof the charges in this bill. He contacted a financial consultant and made payments designated to repay\nhis overdue store account, which is not reflected in his credit report.\nThe creditors for the unpaid bills in allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h of the SOR are\nbarred from collecting these debts under the state 3-year statute of limitations. See State Code. Ann.\n\u00a7 15-3-530.  Thus, he receives partial credit for resolution of most of his debt. The State Court of\n21\nAppeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of these delinquent debts through the statute of limitations has ended his potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements because he is no longer \u201cfinancially overextended\u201d,\nbut it does not negate his past conduct in not paying his outstanding debts. As a young person,\nApplicant got into financial trouble with credit. He over extended himself. He has matured since then.\nHe has learned to better manage his finances. He pays his bills on time and recently purchased a\nhouse.\n\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he falsified his answer to Question 22b, but then qualified his\n22\nadmission, stating that he thought the question was for any debts not listed on that form (an unidentified form). In light\nof his qualified answer, his answer to the allegation in subparagraph 2.a. is deemed a denial.\n8\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Applicant has denied the government\u2019s allegation of falsification under Guideline E,\nsubparagraph 2.a of the SOR. The government has established that Applicant\u2019s answer to Question\n22b is inaccurate regarding a material fact, the existence of overdue debts. For Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire...) and PC DC\nE2.A5.1.2.3. (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and\nmaterial matters to an investigator...) to apply, Applicant must have deliberately falsified his\nanswer.  At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he knew his had old debts when he answered\n22\nQuestion 22b. He also credibly testified that he was not concerned about losing his job when he\nanswered this question and that he was probably careless. He could offer no other reason for his\nanswer. His admission that he knew he had unpaid debts when he completed his questionnaire is not,\nby itself, sufficient to establish he intended to deliberately deceive the government about his debts.\nHe does not deny his long-term debt problems nor did he in his responses. His failure to provide\nimmediate information on his debts was the result of sloppiness when completing his security\nclearance application. While he should have taken more care, his carelessness does not equal\nintentional falsification. When the investigator questioned him about his debt, he willingly discussed\nand specifically outlined his financial problems. Because he has been forthcoming about his debts,\nI find he did not deliberately fail to provide this information when he completed his security clearance\napplication. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nApplicant served honorably for two and one-half years in the Army. He received several\nmedals for his actions and service during this time. He held a top secret clearance without incident.\nAs a young adult, he carelessly managed his money by using credit to purchase items he could not\npurchase with cash. He overextended his finances and could not met the monthly payments on his\ndebts. He has since developed better spending habits and lives within his financial means. He has not\nincurred significant new, unpaid debt. \nI have weighed the mitigating factors, the reasons for Applicant\u2019s debts, his current family\nsituation, his present financial situation, his steady employment, and his excellent performance in the\nArmy against his unpaid debt. I find that the weight of the evidence indicates that he is a person who\n\n9\nis trustworthy. He would not act in a manner which would harm his employer or the government.\nThere is little likelihood he would violate the privacy rights he has agreed to protect because of his\nexisting debt problems. I conclude he has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to\nfinancial considerations. The personal conduct concern is not substantiated.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 1 Applicant attached the following six documents to her Answer: 1: release of 2007 state tax lien; 2: medical debt payment plan; 3: settlement related to allegation 1.m.; 4: settlement related to allegation 1.n.; 5: settlement related to allegation 1.o.; 6: Personal Financial Statement, dated December 29, 2008. 3 Applicant is a 31-year-old college graduate who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1999 (GE 2).

The government did not present evidence related to the personal \nconduct allegation. She has mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines \nfor Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct. Accordingly, her request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting a security clearance \napplication, Standard Form 86 (SF-86) on January 21, 2008. After reviewing the results \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. The action was \ntaken under Executive order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn December 4, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), which specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In her Answer to the SOR,1 \nsigned and notarized on December 30, 2008, Applicant admitted all allegations under \nGuideline F, except allegations 1.m., 1.n., and 1.o. Under Guideline E, she denied \nallegation 2.a., which alleged falsification of information she provided on her security \nclearance application. Applicant also requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. At the hearing, Department Counsel stated on the record that the government \nwould not pursue the Guideline E allegation. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 22, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me the same day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January \n28, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 26, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered six exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6. GE 2 through 6 were admitted without objection. Applicant \nobjected to GE 1. I overruled the objection and admitted the exhibit. Applicant testified, \nand offered three exhibits. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) were marked as A through C, and \nadmitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. Department Counsel forwarded without objection Applicant\u2019s timely \nsubmission of three additional documents. I admitted the additional documents as AE D \nthrough F. DOHA received the transcript on March 13, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the \npleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record evidence, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \n1 Applicant attached the following six documents to her Answer: 1: release of 2007 state tax lien; 2: \nmedical debt payment plan; 3: settlement related to allegation 1.m.; 4: settlement related to allegation \n1.n.; 5: settlement related to allegation 1.o.; 6: Personal Financial Statement, dated December 29, 2008. \n\n \n \n3 \nApplicant is a 31-year-old college graduate who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering in 1999 (GE 2). Since 1996, she has had short-term jobs as a \nresearch assistant, an independent contractor engineer, and an assistant planning \nengineer. Among her longer term jobs was a position as an engineer for three-and-a-\nhalf years from 2000 to 2003, and as a software engineer for two years from January \n2005 to December 2006. She had several short periods of unemployment, as well as a \nlonger period from December 2003 to September 2004. She accepted employment with \na defense contractor as a systems engineer in December 2006, and completed her \ncurrent security clearance application for that position. Previously, she held a security \nclearance in 2006 while working as a software engineer (GE 2). \n \nApplicant married in 1997 and had three sons, who are now 3, 6, and 11 years \nold (GE 2). Several factors led to financial difficulties during Applicant's marriage. When \nher first son was born, she and her husband were college students, with the attendant \neducational expenses. Later, Applicant was the sole support of the family while her \nhusband pursued his Master\u2019s degree. She was unemployed for several months in \n1998, again in 2000, and for nine months in 2004. Her husband was hospitalized in \n2007, and on medical leave for approximately six months (Tr 61-62). He was under \npsychiatric care from June 2007 to at least January 2008 (GE 2). Applicant's husband \nwas emotionally abusive during their marriage and she decided to take her children and \nleave him in May 2007.  \n \nApplicant's three children live with her. Her husband did not pay child support for \napproximately one-and-a-half years after their separation. During the period when \nApplicant was separated and living without financial support from her husband, \nApplicant turned to her family for assistance. Her parents helped at times, when \npossible (AE A). A family court Order, issued in October 2008, required him to pay child \nsupport of $861 per month (AE B). The final divorce order obligated him to continue to \npay this amount (AE F). \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR total almost $8,000. Applicant\u2019s gross annual \nsalary for 2008 was approximately $51,800. She paid approximately $5,000 for health \ninsurance in 2008, and also set aside $10,000 in health-care savings accounts. After \ntaxes were withheld, her net annual income as of December 21, 2008 was $27,949 (AE \nE). Applicant pays rent and has been on time with her payments since her separation. \nShe owns a car on which the loan has been paid in full (GE 3). No judgments have \nbeen filed or garnishments placed on her wages, and she has no outstanding loans. \nApplicant did not seek financial counseling about her debts, but contacted creditors \ndirectly to arrange settlements and payment plans (Tr 51-55). On her November 2008 \nPersonal Financial Statement, she had a negative monthly remainder of $34. However, \nher husband is now responsible for a $355 monthly payment that she had listed as a \ndebt (Tr 49). Applicant's December 2008 Personal Financial Statement shows a positive \nmonthly net remainder of $395 (Answer Document 6). \n \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges 15 debts. The current status of the alleged \ndebts follows. \n \n$ \nState tax lien (allegation 1.a.): While Applicant's husband was \nunemployed in 2007, he received unemployment compensation, which \nwas taxable in the state in which they lived (Tr 61). Applicant and her \nhusband were unaware that taxes were due on this income. The state \nfiled a lien in April 2007 for $885 (Tr 39). Applicant established a \npayment plan (Tr 24), and as of December 2008, the lien had been \nreleased (Answer document 1).  \n \n$ \nMedical debts (allegations 1.b. through 1.l.): The medical debts \nalleged total approximately $1,300. All the debts are owed to the same \ncreditor, a hospital. They stem from the birth of Applicant's third son, a \nrelated surgery, and additional bills for the medical needs of her \nchildren. When Applicant researched the debts, she found that, in \nseveral cases, the hospital had failed to file for insurance \nreimbursement. As a result of her investigation, the hospital was \nreimbursed. She arranged a payment plan for the balance of the debt, \nand is current on the plan (AE C; Answer document 2; Tr 25-26; 40-\n43). \n \n$ \nCredit card accounts (allegations 1.m., 1.n., and 1.o.): These \nallegations relate to three credit card accounts that became delinquent \nduring Applicant's marriage. After she began receiving child support in \nOctober 2008, Applicant contacted each creditor. She arranged a \nsettlement of $1,422 on the account at allegation 1.m.and paid it in full \nwith three installments from October through December 2008 (Tr 26; \nAnswer document 3). She arranged a settlement of $1,387 on the \naccount alleged at 1.n., and made three payments from October \nthrough December 2008, which paid the account in full (AE D; Answer \ndocument 4). Applicant also obtained a settlement of $1,400 on the \naccount alleged at 1.o., and paid it in full with three payments from \nOctober through December 2008 (Answer document 5). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Decisions must reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n2 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n5 \n                                                \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nthe cited Guidelines.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest3 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.4 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \n \n3 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n5 See Egan at 531; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n                                                \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \nAG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.6 Applicant had financial \nproblems during her marriage, from the late 1990s to about 2007, because of periods \nof unemployment, college tuition and expenses, and medical bills for her husband and \nchildren. After she separated from her husband, Applicant did not receive child support \nfor approximately 18 months, which left her unable to address her financial \ndelinquencies. The record contains no evidence of other disqualifying conditions such \nas frivolous spending, or debts related to alcoholism, gambling or deceptive practices.  \n \n \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate \nsecurity concerns. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant had a difficult marriage. Soon after they married, she and her husband \nhad a baby. At the same time, they were both attending college. Subsequently, \nApplicant was the sole family support while her husband attended graduate school. \nThey had the expenses attendant on raising a child, as well as tuition and other college \nand graduate school expenses. Applicant's husband became emotionally abusive, was \nhospitalized, and was under psychiatric care. Both she and her husband also had \nperiods of unemployment during the marriage. After they separated, Applicant's \nhusband refused to provide financial support for one-and-a-half years, and she faced \nfinancial hardship trying to support four people on one income. The unemployment, her \nhusband\u2019s medical problems, his refusal to support his children, and the abuse, were \nconditions that Applicant could not control. She acted reasonably by leaving the \nabusive situation, and by seeking financial assistance from her family. When her \nhusband began paying child support in October 2008, she again acted reasonably by \nimmediately taking action to resolve her debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n \n6 Although a state tax lien for $885 was filed against Applicant and her ex-husband, AG \u00b6 19(g) does not \napply. Applicant mistakenly failed to pay state income tax on her husband\u2019s unemployment \ncompensation in 2007; however, nothing in the record indicates that she failed to file an income tax \nreturn, and the SOR does not allege a failure to file taxes as a concern.  \n\n \n \n7 \n \nAlthough Applicant did not seek financial counseling, she did bring her financial \nsituation under control, and AG \u00b6 20(c) applies partially. The dates of Applicant's \npayment plans indicate that as soon as her husband began providing child support in \nOctober 2008, giving Applicant the funds to resolve her debts, she began to establish \npayment plans. She has either paid or established a payment plan for each debt in the \nSOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) also applies, as Applicant\u2019s conduct shows a good-faith effort to \nresolve her delinquencies. All the debts alleged in the SOR are paid, except for the \nmedical debts. Applicant established a payment plan for the balance owed to this \nsingle creditor, and is current on that plan.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel stated that the government did not intend to \npursue the allegation of falsification under this Guideline. As the government did not \nwithdraw the allegation, a finding is required. I find for the Applicant under this \nGuideline. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the Guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nGuideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant accrued delinquent debt of almost $8,000 over the past several years. \nHer financial problems resulted from a combination of factors including college and \ngraduate school expenses, periods of unemployment experienced by both Applicant \nand her husband, as well as medical bills for her children and her husband. After \nleaving her abusive husband, Applicant was unable to support herself and her three \n\n \n \n8 \nchildren on her sole income and pay her delinquencies. However, her immediate action \non the debts, once her husband was required to pay child support, shows that her \ndebts resulted not from any desire to avoid her obligations, but from lack of funds. \nApplicant acted in a mature and responsible fashion. Her consistent payments soon \nresolved the balances on all but one debt. Her payment plan is current on the medical \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s efforts demonstrate a sincere intent to meet her financial obligations. \nA fair and common-sense assessment of the available information bearing on \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has satisfied the doubts about \nher ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant   \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

He has delinquent\ndebts, judgments, and repossessions that he refuses to inquire about or take any action concerning\nthem.  He did not include on his security clearance application the judgments, repossessions, or debts\npast due more than 90 days or 180 days because he did not know he had the debts.  He has not\nmitigated security concerns for his finances, but he has mitigated security concerns for his personal\nconduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 26, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 12, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 18, 2006.  He admitted one and denied nine\nallegations under Guideline F, and denied the four allegations under Guideline E.  He provided no\nexplanations for his delinquent debts or personal conduct.  He elected to have the matter decided on\nthe written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 26, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on March 13, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  His response was due April 12, 2007.  As of May 21, 2007, he had not\nresponded.  The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 64-year-old janitor employed by a defense contractor for over 38 years.  He\nhas been married for 39 years, and has four children.  He previously served on active duty in the\nMarines.  He submitted a security clearance application on November 7, 2003.1\nCredit reports of February 26, 2007,  June 12, 2006,  and March 4, 2004,  reveal delinquent\n2\n3\n4\ndebts for Applicant.

Applicant denies these debts.   Applicant states\n5\nhe knows nothing about these debts and does care about them.  The creditors have never contacted\nhim.  He has never inquired about the accounts and does not intend to do so.  It is not embarrassing\nto him that he owes on these accounts.   \n6\nJudgments have been entered against Applicant for $3,034 for Saratoga Inc.;  and for $1,254\n7\nfor Colonial Gas.   Applicant denied he owes these debts.\n8\n9\nApplicant admits his car was repossessed, but denies owing any amount on the car after the\nrepossession.   A judgment for $10,469 has been entered against Applicant in favor of the car\n10\nrepossession creditor.11\nApplicant states that he is not embarrassed about owing creditors.  The fact he owes creditors\ncannot be used to coerce, compromise or pressure him.  He further stated he never gambled, or had\nbad credit because of use of alcohol, illegal drugs, or prescription drugs.  He has no intentions to\ninquire about the debts.  If contacted by the creditors, he is unsure how he would handle the matter.\nHis net monthly income is about $2,400 with expenses of about $675.  He has no credit cards,\nmedical bills, loans, cell phone bills, or transportation expenses.  He has no savings or investment\nproperties.  He has a 401K account but does not know how much is in the account.12\nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to all financial questions on his November 7, 2003, security\nclearance application.   He answered \u201cNO\u201dto question 35 asking if he had any repossessions in the\n13\nlast seven years.  Credit reports show and Applicant admits his car was repossessed in 2002 and a\njudgment entered in September 2003.  Credit reports show, but Applicant denies, another\nrepossession in March 2001.  He answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 37 asking about unpaid judgments in\nthe last seven years.  A judgment was entered against him on May 17, 1999, was within the seven\nyear time line, and is unpaid.  The other judgment was entered against him on February 26, 1996,\n\nItem 11.\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v.

An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n17\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.18\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.

It is merely\n19\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.20\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n21\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n22\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n23\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n24\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 25\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F - Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nGuideline E - Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise eligibility concerns and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate eligibility concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\n\n6\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts reported by credit reports brings the matter within Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\nand FC DC \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  There is not sufficient information\nin the file to determine if FC DC \u00b6 19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or\nother financial analysis applies.  Applicant provided no explanation how or why each delinquent debt\nwas accumulated, except for a car repossession.  He admits the repossession but denies he owes the\ndebt.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.\nOnce the government has established disqualifying conditions, Applicant has the burden to\nrefute, explain, or mitigate the security concern.  Appellant was, at best, indifferent to his financial\nsituation.  He did not know about the debts, and did not even care to inquire.  His response merely\ndenying the debts  has not raised Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b620(a) the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgement, or FC MC 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.   He did not present any information on financial counseling so FC MC \u00b6 20(c) The\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control, does not apply.  Applicant presented no information\nconcerning any attempt to repay any of the debts so FC MC \u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, does not apply.  Applicant took no action\nto inquire about his finances and to either pay or resolve his obligations.  Applicant presented no\ninformation raising any other mitigating condition, so he has failed to carry his burden.  I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns for financial considerations.\nThe allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are unfounded.  The Government has\nshown Applicant\u2019s answers to questions 35, 37, 38, and 39 were incorrect, but this does not prove the\nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose information about his finances.  Applicant denied intentional\nfalsification.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written\ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance is a security\nconcern.  But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and\nmaterial.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  An omission concerning unpaid\njudgments and delinquencies is not deliberate if the person did not know of their existence.  Applicant\ndid not know he had the debts.  His attitude towards his finances are such that it is conceivable he\nlacked knowledge of the debts.  His incorrect answers to the questions were not deliberate because of\nhis cavalier attitude towards his finances leading to his lack of knowledge.  I find Applicant did not\n\n7\ndeliberately fail to provide correct information in response to financial questions on his security\nclearance application.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Under\nfinancial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability\nto protect classified information.  An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information.  Behaving\nresponsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave\nin other aspects of life.  Applicant shows total irresponsibility towards his finances.  He does not care\nif he has delinquent debts and refuses to make inquiries concerning his debts or how to pay them.  He\nhas no assets except for a 401K and he does not even know how much is in that account.  His\nindifference to his finances shows he would be indifferent to protecting classified information.  His\nfinancial irresponsibility shows he may be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in his obligation to\nprotect classified information.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. thru 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. thru 2.d.::\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nThomas M. Crean\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPhilip D. Cave, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 26, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n\n\u201cIf in the case of a commissioned officer . . .  the sentence of a court-martial extends to dismissal, that part of\n1\nthe sentence providing for dismissal may not be executed until approved by the Secretary concerned or by such Under\nSecretary or Assistant Secretary as the Secretary concerned may designate.\u201d  10 U.S.C.  \u00a7  871(b).  \n2\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 29, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge improperly applied the\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a program analyst working for\na government contractor.  He has held a security clearance since 1994.\nIn December 1985, Applicant entered the U.S. Marine Corps.  In 1997, he completed Officer\nCandidate School and was commissioned with the rank of Second Lieutenant.  \nIn July 2001, Applicant was charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)\nwith  fraternization, conduct unbecoming an officer, sodomy, and adultery.  He entered a conditional\nplea of guilty and, upon conviction, was sentenced to 165 days confinement, forfeiture of all pay and\nallowances, and a dismissal from the Marine Corps.  Applicant served 139 days of confinement.  His\nconviction was still in appeal, and therefore his dismissal unexecuted, at the close of the record in\nthis security clearance hearing.  \n1\nIn arguing the issues on appeal in his security clearance case, Applicant states that he was\nadvised by his military counsel prior to the security clearance hearing not to be specific in discussing\nthe facts underlying his court-martial.  As a consequence, the Judge concluded that his failure to\ndiscuss the facts in detail establishes security concerns with respect to the Guideline E allegations\nunder Directive  \u00b6  E2.A5.1.1.2: \u201cRefusal to complete required security forms, releases, or provide\nfull, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\u201d  Decision\nat 6.   Applicant contends that the Judge found against him on a matter that was not raised in the\nSOR, therefore depriving him of the due process afforded by the Directive.    \nThe above disqualifying condition was not the only one on which the Judge relied in reaching\nher adverse conclusions under Guideline E.  Moreover, even if it is assumed for the purposes of this\nappeal that Applicant\u2019s position is correct as regards Guideline E, we nevertheless conclude that the\nJudge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is sustainable under Guideline J.  We note that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings are consistent with other record evidence: that Applicant was convicted of conduct\nunbecoming an officer and of adultery, the other charges having been dismissed either as part of his\nplea agreement or during the UCMJ appellate process; that the facts underlying the conviction\ninclude, at least in part, Applicant\u2019s having offered a subordinate female Marine time off from work\nin exchange for sex; and that the Navy and Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (Court) held\nthat Applicant\u2019s dismissal was a sentence appropriate for the offenses of which he was convicted.\nSee Applicant Exhibit A at 1-2.  This misconduct is serious, the Court describing it as\n\n\u201cConduct [Unbecoming an Officer] is action or behavior in an official capacity which, in dishonoring or\n2\ndisgracing the person as an officer, seriously compromises the. . . person\u2019s standing as an officer. . .\u201d  Manual for Courts-\nMartial United States, Part IV, \u00b6 59(c)(2)(2000 ed.).   \n3\n\u201cunconscionable.\u201d  Id. at 2.   Viewed in light of the record as a whole, we hold that the Judge\u2019s\n2\nadverse decision under Guideline J is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law. \n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.
